0,4,Accuracy of Parent-Reported Child Height and Weight and Calculated Body Mass Index Compared With Objectively Measured Anthropometrics: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial
1,0,Electronic health (eHealth) interventions for children often rely on parent-reported child anthropometric measures. 
2,0,"However, limited studies have assessed parental accuracy in reporting child height and weight via Web-based approaches."
3,1,This study was a secondary analysis of data from a 12-week childhood obesity pilot randomized controlled trial in families with children aged 4 to 11 years in Australia. 
4,1,"We asked parents to report demographic information, including child height and weight, using an online survey before their child's height and weight were objectively measured by a trained research assistant at baseline and week 12. "
5,1,"We analyzed data using the Lin concordance correlation coefficient (rho c, ranging from 0 [poor] to +/- 1 [perfect] concordance), Cohen kappa coefficient, and multivariable linear regression models."
6,2,There were 42 families at baseline and 35 families (83%) at week 12. 
7,2,"Overall, the accuracy of parent-reported child height was moderate (rho c=.94), accuracy of weight was substantial (rho c=.96), and accuracy of calculated body mass index was poor (rho c=.63). "
8,2,"Parents underreported child height and weight, respectively, by 0.9 cm and 0.5 kg at baseline and by 0.2 cm and 1.6 kg after participating in a 12-week brief Web-based family lifestyle intervention. "
9,2,The overall interrater agreement of child body mass index category was moderate at baseline (kappa=.59) and week 12 (kappa=.54). 
10,2,"The weight category calculated from 74% (n=31) and 70% (n=23) of parent-reported child height and weight was accurate at baseline and week 12, respectively. "
11,2,Parental age was significantly (95% CI -0.52 to -0.06; P=.01) associated with accuracy of reporting child height. 
12,2,Child age was significantly (95% CI -2.34 to -0.06; P=.04) associated with reporting of child weight.
13,3,Most Australian parents were reasonably accurate in reporting child height and weight among a group of children aged 4 to 11 years. 
14,3,The weight category of most of the children when calculated from parent-reported data was in agreement with the objectively measured data despite the body mass index calculated from parent-reported data having poor concordance at both time points. 
15,3,Online parent-reported child height and weight may be a valid method of collecting child anthropometric data ahead of participation in a Web-based program. 
16,3,Future studies with larger sample sizes and repeated measures over time in the context of eHealth research are warranted. 
17,3,Future studies should consider modeling the impact of calibration equations applied to parent-reported anthropometric data on study outcomes.
18,4,Using Relational Agents to Promote Family Communication Around Type 1 Diabetes Self-Management in the Diabetes Family Teamwork Online Intervention: Longitudinal Pilot Study
19,0,Family conflict can reduce adolescent adherence to type 1 diabetes management tasks. 
20,0,The Family Teamwork in-person intervention was shown to be efficacious in reducing conflict and low adherence to diabetes-related tasks. 
21,0,"Its reach and potential impact, however, were limited by the need to deliver the intervention sessions in person. "
22,0,"Relational agents (ie, computerized versions of humans) have been shown to appeal to diverse audiences and may be an acceptable replacement for a human in technology-based behavior change interventions."
23,1,Parent-adolescent dyads were recruited through a diabetes care clinic at a large tertiary care hospital in the southwestern United States. 
24,1,"A one-group design, with assessments at baseline, immediate postintervention, and 3 months later, was used to assess feasibility. "
25,1,"A priori feasibility criteria included an assessment of recruitment, completion, attrition, program satisfaction, therapeutic alliance, attitudes toward the relational agent, and data collection. "
26,1,The institutional review board at Baylor College of Medicine approved the protocol (H-37245).
27,2,Twenty-seven adolescents aged 10 to 15 years with type 1 diabetes and their parents were enrolled. 
28,2,"Criteria used to assess feasibility were (1) recruitment goals were met (n=20), (2) families completed >= 75% of the modules, (3) attrition rate was <= 10%, (4) program satisfaction was high (80% of families), (5) therapeutic alliance was high (average score of >= 60/84), (6) families expressed positive attitudes toward the relational agent (average item score of >= 5 on >= 4 items), (7) >= 80% of data were collected at post 1 and post 2, and (8) few technical issues (<= 10%) occurred during intervention delivery. "
29,2,All feasibility criteria were met. 
30,2,Qualitative data confirmed that adolescents and parents had positive reactions to both the content and approach.
31,3,The Diabetes Family Teamwork Online intervention proved to be a feasible and acceptable method for enhancing communication around diabetes management tasks in families with an adolescent who has type 1 diabetes.
32,4,Associations Between Engagement With an Online Health Community and Changes in Patient Activation and Health Care Utilization: Longitudinal Web-Based Survey
33,0,Participation in online health communities (OHCs) is a popular trend in the United Kingdom. 
34,0,"However, so far, no evidence exists to indicate an association between participation in OHCs and improved health outcomes."
35,1,"Active new OHC users on HealthUnlocked (HU) were surveyed to measure demographics, levels of patient activation (describing a person's confidence in managing their own health; scale 0-100 with 4 categories), health care utilization, and health status using a Web-based survey at baseline and 3 months. "
36,1,Patient activation at baseline and 3 months was compared (aim 1). 
37,1,"Alongside, for a sample of HU users and survey responders, daily OHC website usage data were automatically captured. "
38,1,This was used to identify clusters of engagement with HU (aim 2). 
39,1,"For survey responders, baseline characteristics, patient activation, health care utilization, and health status were compared at baseline and 3 months, overall, and between engagement clusters using t tests and chi-square tests (aims 3 and 4)."
40,2,"In 329 people who completed both surveys, baseline activation was most frequently level 3, described as taking action but still lacking confidence. "
41,2,"At follow-up, a change of 2.6 points was seen, with the greatest change seen in those at lowest baseline activation levels. "
42,2,"In addition, 4 clusters of engagement were identified: low, medium, high, and very high, who were active on HU for a mean of 4, 12, 29, and 59 days, respectively. "
43,2,Survey responders were more commonly high or very high engagers. 
44,2,Baseline activation was highest in low and very high engagers. 
45,2,Overall activation increased over time in all engagement groups. 
46,2,"Very high engagers had the greatest improvement in activation (5 points), although the average change was not above what is considered clinically meaningful for any group. "
47,2,"Fewer accident and emergency visits were seen at follow-up in those with higher engagement, although this trend was not seen for other health care utilization measures. "
48,2,There was no change in health status at 3 months.
49,3,"This observational study provides some insight into how patterns of engagement with OHCs are associated with changes in patient activation, health care utilization, and health status. "
50,3,"Over 3 months, overall, the change in activation was not clinically significant, and there were some indications that OHCs may be of benefit to particular groups. "
51,3,"However, the study limitations prevent firm conclusions about causal relationships."
52,4,Stroke Survivors on Twitter: Sentiment and Topic Analysis From a Gender Perspective
53,0,Stroke is the worldwide leading cause of long-term disabilities. 
54,0,"Women experience more activity limitations, worse health-related quality of life, and more poststroke depression than men. "
55,0,"Twitter is increasingly used by individuals to broadcast their day-to-day happenings, providing unobtrusive access to samples of spontaneously expressed opinions on all types of topics and emotions."
56,1,We performed sentiment analysis based on a state-of-the-art lexicon (National Research Council) with syuzhet R package. 
57,1,The emotion scores for men and women were first subjected to an F-test and then to a Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
58,1,"We extended the emotional analysis, assigning happiness scores with the hedonometer (a tool specifically designed considering Twitter inputs). "
59,1,We calculated daily happiness average scores for all tweets. 
60,1,We created a term map for an exploratory clustering analysis using VosViewer software. 
61,1,"We performed structural topic modelling with stm R package, allowing us to identify main topics by gender. "
62,1,We assigned happiness scores to all the words defining the main identified topics and compared them by gender.
63,2,"We analyzed 800,424 tweets posted from August 1, 2007 to December 1, 2018, by 479 stroke survivors: Women (n=244) posted 396,898 tweets, and men (n=235) posted 403,526 tweets. "
64,2,The stroke survivor condition and gender as well as membership in at least 3 stroke-specific Twitter lists of active users were manually verified for all 479 participants. 
65,2,"Their total number of tweets since 2007 was 5,257,433; therefore, we analyzed the most recent 15.2% of all their tweets. "
66,2,"Positive emotions (anticipation, trust, and joy) were significantly higher (P<. "
67,2,"001) in women, while negative emotions (disgust, fear, and sadness) were significantly higher (P<. "
68,2,001) in men in the analysis of raw frequencies and proportion of emotions. 
69,2,Happiness mean scores throughout the considered period show higher levels of happiness in women. 
70,2,We calculated the top 20 topics (with percentages and CIs) more likely addressed by gender and found that women's topics show higher levels of happiness scores.
71,3,We applied two different approaches-the Plutchik model and hedonometer tool-to a sample of stroke survivors' tweets. 
72,3,We conclude that women express positive emotions and happiness much more than men.
73,4,A Multicomponent eHealth Intervention for Family Carers for People Affected by Psychosis: A Coproduced Design and Build Study
74,0,"Psychosis, including schizophrenia, is the most common severe mental illness affecting 1% of the population worldwide. "
75,0,A large number of people provide long-term support and care for a relative with psychosis. 
76,0,"Although psychoeducational interventions, especially those delivered through a face-to-face group format, have an established evidence base for improving the caregiving experience, well-being, and health outcomes, large-scale implementation and access remain limited. "
77,0,There is a demand for such provision to be made through the internet for greater flexibility and wider access.
78,1,We adapted a structured eHealth intervention build method to include participatory research activities involving key stakeholders and end users to co-design and coproduce our intervention. 
79,1,An expert advisory group (EAG) comprising public involvement members led the formative design and build work using an agile build process. 
80,1,Carers independent from the study were consulted on the evolving drafts of the intervention prototype through focus group meetings. 
81,1,These results were fed back into the intervention build work continuously to ensure end users' input inform every stage of the process.
82,2,"An EAG comprising individuals with lived experience of psychosis, carers, health care professionals, researchers, voluntary organization workers, and eLearning experts (n=14) was established. "
83,2,A total of 4 coproduction workshops were held over 1 year during which the alpha and beta prototypes were designed and built through the participatory research work. 
84,2,"Alongside this, 2 rounds of focus group study with carers (n=24, in 4 groups) were conducted to seek consultation on end users' views and ideas to optimize the intervention design and usability. "
85,2,"Finally, the EAG carried out a Web-based walk-through exercise on the intervention prototype and further refined it to make it ready for an online usability test. "
86,2,The final product contains multiple sections providing information on psychosis and related caregiving topics and interactive discussion forums with experts and peers for psychosocial support. 
87,2,"It provides psychoeducation and psychosocial support for carers through the internet, promoting flexible access and individualized choices of information and support."
88,3,The participatory research work led to the coproduction of a eHealth intervention called COPe-support (Carers fOr People with Psychosis e-support). 
89,3,"We believe the study methodology, results, and output have optimized the intervention design and usability, fitting the end users' needs and usage pattern. "
90,3,COPe-support is currently being tested for its effectiveness in promoting carers' health outcome through an online randomized controlled trial.
91,4,The Cost-Effectiveness of an Internet Intervention to Facilitate Mental Health Help-Seeking by Young Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial
92,0,Little empirical evidence is available to support the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of internet interventions to increase help-seeking behavior for mental health in young adults.
93,1,A cost-utility analysis alongside the main randomized trial of Link was conducted from the Australian health care sector perspective. 
94,1,Young adults aged 18 to 25 years were randomized to the Link intervention (n=205) or usual care (n=208) with 1- and 3-month follow-ups. 
95,1,The primary outcome of this study was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) measured by the assessment of quality of life-4D. 
96,1,Costs were calculated based on the self-reported resource use questionnaire and were reported in 2015 Australian dollars. 
97,1,Primary analyses were conducted as intention-to-treat and reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. 
98,1,Completer analyses were conducted in a sensitivity analysis.
99,2,Significantly more QALYs were gained in the intervention group than the control group (0.15 vs 0.14; P<.001). 
100,2,The intervention was associated with significantly lower health professional consultation costs at 1-month follow-up (mean costs Aus $98 vs Aus $162; P<.05). 
101,2,"Costs of hospital services were lower at 3 months in the intervention arm (mean costs Aus $47 vs Aus $101); however, there was insufficient sample size to detect a significant difference between the groups. "
102,2,There were no statistically significant differences in the total costs between the 2 arms. 
103,2,"Relative to the control group, those who received the intervention experienced 0.01 more QALYs (0.00-0.02) and had lower total health sector costs of Aus -$81 (Aus -$348 to Aus $186) over 3 months. "
104,2,The intervention was found to be more effective and less costly compared with usual help-seeking strategies. 
105,2,"The intervention was 100% likely to be cost-effective below a willingness-to-pay value-for-money threshold of Aus $28,033 per QALY. "
106,2,Results were robust in the sensitivity analysis.
107,3,Our study found that the online youth mental health help-seeking Web service is a cost-effective intervention for young people aged 18 to 25 years compared with usual search strategies. 
108,3,Further research is required to confirm these results.
109,4,Visibility of Community Nursing Within an Administrative Health Classification System: Evaluation of Content Coverage
110,0,The World Health Organization is in the process of developing an international administrative classification for health called the International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI). 
111,0,The purpose of ICHI is to provide a tool for supporting intervention reporting and analysis at a global level for policy development and beyond. 
112,0,Nurses represent the largest resource carrying out clinical interventions in any health system. 
113,0,"With the shift in nursing care from hospital to community settings in many countries, it is important to ensure that community nursing interventions are present in any international health information system. "
114,0,"Thus, an investigation into the extent to which community nursing interventions were covered in ICHI was needed."
115,1,This descriptive study used a content mapping approach in 2 phases in 2018. 
116,1,A total of 187 nursing intervention codes were extracted from the ICNP Community Nursing Catalogue and mapped to ICHI. 
117,1,"In phase 1, 2 coders completed independent mapping activities. "
118,1,"In phase 2, the 2 coders compared each list and discussed concept matches until consensus on ICNP-ICHI match and on mapping relationship was reached."
119,2,"The initial percentage agreement between the 2 coders was 47% (n=88), but reached 100% with consensus processes. "
120,2,"After consensus was reached, 151 (81%) of the community nursing interventions resulted in an ICHI match. "
121,2,A total of 36 (19%) of community nursing interventions had no match to ICHI content. 
122,2,"A total of 100 (53%) community nursing interventions resulted in a broader ICHI code, 9 (5%) resulted in a narrower ICHI code, and 42 (23%) were considered equivalent. "
123,2,"ICNP concepts that were not represented in ICHI were thematically grouped into the categories family and caregivers, death and dying, and case management."
124,3,"Overall, the content mapping yielded similar results to other content mapping studies in nursing. "
125,3,"However, it also found areas of missing concept coverage, difficulties with interterminology mapping, and further need to develop mapping methods."
126,4,Persuasive System Design Principles and Behavior Change Techniques to Stimulate Motivation and Adherence in Electronic Health Interventions to Support Weight Loss Maintenance: Scoping Review
127,0,"Maintaining weight after weight loss is a major health challenge, and eHealth (electronic health) solutions may be a way to meet this challenge. "
128,0,Application of behavior change techniques (BCTs) and persuasive system design (PSD) principles in eHealth development may contribute to the design of technologies that positively influence behavior and motivation to support the sustainable health behavior change needed.
129,1,"A systematic literature search was conducted in PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE (including PubMed), EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and AMED, from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2018. "
130,1,Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology was applied. 
131,1,"Publications on eHealth interventions were included if focusing on weight loss or weight loss maintenance, in combination with motivation or adherence and behavior change."
132,2,"The search identified 317 publications, of which 45 met the inclusion criteria. "
133,2,"Of the 45 publications, 11 (24%) focused on weight loss maintenance, and 34 (76%) focused on weight loss. "
134,2,"Mobile phones were the most frequently used technology (28/45, 62%). "
135,2,"Frequently used wearables were activity trackers (14/45, 31%), as well as other monitoring technologies such as wireless or digital scales (8/45, 18%). "
136,2,All included publications were anchored in behavior change theories. 
137,2,Feedback and monitoring and goals and planning were core behavior change technique clusters applied in the majority of included publications. 
138,2,Social support and associations through prompts and cues to support and maintain new habits were more frequently used in weight loss maintenance than weight loss interventions. 
139,2,"In both types of interventions, frequently applied persuasive principles were self-monitoring, goal setting, and feedback. "
140,2,"Tailoring, reminders, personalization, and rewards were additional principles frequently applied in weight loss maintenance interventions. "
141,2,"Results did not reveal an ideal combination of techniques or principles to stimulate motivation, adherence, and weight loss maintenance. "
142,2,"However, the most frequently mentioned individual techniques and principles applied to stimulate motivation were, personalization, simulation, praise, and feedback, whereas associations were frequently mentioned to stimulate adherence. "
143,2,"eHealth interventions that found significant effects for weight loss maintenance all applied self-monitoring, feedback, goal setting, and shaping knowledge, combined with a human social support component to support healthy behaviors."
144,3,"To our knowledge, this is the first review examining key BCTs and PSD principles applied in weight loss maintenance interventions compared with those of weight loss interventions. "
145,3,This review identified several techniques and principles applied to stimulate motivation and adherence. 
146,3,Future research should aim to examine which eHealth design combinations can be the most effective in support of long-term behavior change and weight loss maintenance.
147,4,An Internet of Things Buttons to Measure and Respond to Restroom Cleanliness in a Hospital Setting: Descriptive Study
148,0,Restroom cleanliness is an important factor in hospital quality. 
149,0,"Due to its dynamic process, it can be difficult to detect the presence of dirty restrooms that need to be cleaned. "
150,0,"Using an Internet of Things (IoT) button can permit users to designate restrooms that need cleaning and in turn, allow prompt response from housekeeping to maintain real-time restroom cleanliness."
151,1,We deployed IoT buttons in 16 hospital restrooms. 
152,1,"Over an 8-month period, housekeeping staff received real-time notifications and responded to button presses for restroom cleaning. "
153,1,All button presses were recorded. 
154,1,"We reported average button usage by hospital area, time of day, and day of week. "
155,1,We also conducted interviews with housekeeping supervisors and staff to understand their acceptance of and experience with the system.
156,2,"Over 8 months, 1920 requests to clean restrooms in the main hospital lobby and satellite buildings were received. "
157,2,"The hospital lobby IoT buttons received over half (N=1055, 55%) of requests for cleaning. "
158,2,Most requests occurred in afternoon hours from 3 PM to midnight. 
159,2,Requests for cleaning remained stable throughout the work week with fewer requests occurring over weekends. 
160,2,IoT button use was sustained throughout the study period. 
161,2,Interviews with housekeeping supervisors and staff demonstrated acceptance of the IoT buttons; actual use was centered around asynchronous communication between supervisors and staff in response to requests to clean restrooms.
162,3,An IoT button system is a feasible method to generate on-demand request for restroom cleaning that is easy to deploy and that users will consistently engage with. 
163,3,Data from this system have the potential to enable responsive scheduling for restroom service and anticipate periods of high restroom utilization in a hospital.
164,4,Optional Web-Based Videoconferencing Added to Office-Based Care for Women Receiving Psychotherapy During the Postpartum Period: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
165,0,"Depression and anxiety during the postpartum period are common, with psychotherapy often being the preferred method of treatment. "
166,0,"However, psychological, physical, and social barriers prevent women from receiving appropriate and timely psychotherapy. "
167,0,The option of receiving psychotherapy through videoconferencing (VC) during the postpartum period presents an opportunity for more accessible and flexible care.
168,1,We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial with 1:1 randomization to office-based care (treatment as usual; TAU) or office-based care with the option of VC (treatment as usual plus videoconferencing; TAU-VC) for psychotherapy during the postpartum period. 
169,1,"We assessed the ability to recruit and retain postpartum women into the study from an urban perinatal mental health program offering postpartum psychotherapy, and we evaluated the uptake, acceptability, and satisfaction with VC as an addition to in-person psychotherapy. "
170,1,We also compared therapy attendance using therapist logs and symptoms between treatment groups. 
171,1,"Symptoms were assessed at baseline and 3 months postrandomization with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item, and Parental Stress Scale. "
172,1,"Furthermore, 3-month scores were compared between groups with intention-to-treat linear mixed-effects models controlling for baseline score."
173,2,"We enrolled 38 participants into the study, with 19 participants in each treatment group. "
174,2,"Attendance data were available for all participants, with follow-up symptom measures available for 25 out of 38 participants (66%). "
175,2,"Among the 19 TAU-VC participants, 14 participants (74%) utilized VC at least once. "
176,2,"Most participants were highly satisfied with the VC option, and they reported average savings of Can $26 and 2.5 hours in travel and childcare expenses and time per appointment. "
177,2,There were no significant differences between the 2 groups for psychotherapy attendance or symptoms.
178,3,"The option of VC appears to be an acceptable method of receiving psychotherapy for postpartum women, with benefits described in costs and time savings. "
179,3,"On the basis of this small pilot sample, there were no significant differences in outcomes between office-based care with or without the option of VC. "
180,3,"This study has demonstrated the feasibility of such a program in an urban center, which suggests that a larger study would be beneficial to provide evidence that is more conclusive."
181,4,Identifying Protective Health Behaviors on Twitter: Observational Study of Travel Advisories and Zika Virus
182,0,An estimated 3.9 billion individuals live in a location endemic for common mosquito-borne diseases. 
183,0,The emergence of Zika virus in South America in 2015 marked the largest known Zika outbreak and caused hundreds of thousands of infections. 
184,0,Internet data have shown promise in identifying human behaviors relevant for tracking and understanding other diseases.
185,1,"We combined keyword filtering and machine learning classification to identify first-person reactions to Zika in 29,386 English-language tweets in the context of travel, including considerations and reports of travel cancellation. "
186,1,"We further explored demographic, network, and linguistic characteristics of users who change their behavior compared with control groups."
187,2,"We found differences in the demographics, social networks, and linguistic patterns of 1567 individuals identified as changing or considering changing travel behavior in response to Zika as compared with a control sample of Twitter users. "
188,2,"We found significant differences between geographic areas in the United States, significantly more discussion by women than men, and some evidence of differences in levels of exposure to Zika-related information."
189,3,"Our findings have implications for informing the ways in which public health organizations communicate with the public on social media, and the findings contribute to our understanding of the ways in which the public perceives and acts on risks of emerging infectious diseases."
190,4,The Use of Cancer-Specific Patient-Centered Technologies Among Underserved Populations in the United States: Systematic Review
191,0,"In the United States, more than 1.6 million new cases of cancer are estimated to be diagnosed each year. "
192,0,"However, the burden of cancer among the US population is not shared equally, with racial and ethnic minorities and lower-income populations having a higher cancer burden compared with their counterparts. "
193,0,"For example, African Americans have the highest mortality rates and shortest survival rates for most cancers compared with other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. "
194,0,"A wide range of technologies (eg, internet-based [electronic health, eHealth] technologies, mobile [mobile health, mHealth] apps, and telemedicine) available to patients are designed to improve their access to care and empower them to participate actively in their care, providing a means to reduce health care disparities; however, little is known of their use among underserved populations."
195,1,"Computer-based search was conducted in the following academic databases: (1) PubMed (cancer subset), (2) MEDLINE, (3) PsycINFO, and (4) CINAHL. "
196,1,"We included studies that were peer-reviewed, published in the English language, and conducted in the United States. "
197,1,"Each study was individually assessed for relevance, with any disagreements being reconciled by consensus. "
198,1,"We used a 3-step inclusion process in which we examined study titles, abstracts, and full-text papers for assessment of inclusion criteria. "
199,1,We systematically extracted information from each paper meeting our inclusion criteria.
200,2,"This review includes 71 papers that use patient-centered technologies that primarily targeted African Americans (n=31), rural populations (n=14), and Hispanics (n=12). "
201,2,A majority of studies used eHealth technologies (n=41) finding them to be leading sources of cancer-related health information and significantly improving outcomes such as screening among nonadherent individuals and increasing knowledge about cancer and cancer screening. 
202,2,"Studies on mHealth found that participants reported overall favorable responses to receiving health information via short message service (SMS) text message; however, challenges were experienced with respect to lack of knowledge of how to text among some participants. "
203,2,"More complex mobile technologies (eg, a tablet-based risk assessment tool) were also found favorable to use and acceptable among underserved populations; however, they also resulted in more significant barriers, for example, participants expressed concerns regarding security and unfamiliarity with the technology and preferred further instruction and assistance in its use."
204,3,There is a growing body of literature exploring patient-centered technology and its influence on care of underserved populations. 
205,3,"In this review, we find that these technologies seem to be effective, especially when tailored, in improving patient and care-related outcomes. "
206,3,"Despite the potential of patient-centered technologies and the receptivity of underserved populations, challenges still exist with respect to their effective use and usability."
207,4,Using a Facebook Forum to Cope With Narcolepsy After Pandemrix Vaccination: Infodemiology Study
208,0,"In 2010, newly diagnosed narcolepsy cases among children and adolescents were seen in several European countries as a consequence of comprehensive national vaccination campaigns with Pandemrix against H1N1 influenza. "
209,0,"Since then, a large number of people have had to live with narcolepsy and its consequences in daily life, such as effects on school life, social relationships, and activities. "
210,0,"Initially, the adverse effects were not well understood and there was uncertainty about whether there would be any financial compensation. "
211,0,"The situation remained unresolved until 2016, and during these years affected people sought various ways to join forces to handle the many issues involved, including setting up a social media forum."
212,1,We used quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate a series of messages posted in a social media forum for people affected by narcolepsy after vaccination.
213,2,"Group activity was high throughout the years 2010 to 2016, with peaks corresponding to major narcolepsy-related events, such as the appearance of the first cases in 2010, the first payment of compensation in 2011, and passage of a law on compensation in July 2016. "
214,2,"Unusually, most (462/774, 59.7%) of the group took part in discussions and only 312 of 774 (40.3%) were lurkers (compared with the usual 90% rule of thumb for participation in an online community). "
215,2,"The conversation in the group was largely factual and had a civil tone, even though there was a long struggle for the link between the vaccine and narcolepsy to be acknowledged and regarding the compensation issue. "
216,2,"Radical, nonscientific views, such as those expounded by the antivaccination movement, did not shape the discussions in the group but were being actively expressed elsewhere on the internet. "
217,2,"At the outset of the pandemic, there were 18 active Swedish discussion groups on the topic, but most dissolved quickly and only one Facebook group remained active throughout the period."
218,3,The group studied is a good example of social media use for self-help through a difficult situation among people affected by illness and disease. 
219,3,"This shows that social media do not by themselves induce trench warfare but, given a good group composition, can provide a necessary forum for managing an emergency situation where health care and government have failed or are mistrusted, and patients have to organize themselves so as to cope."
220,4,Patients Needs and Requirements for eHealth Pain Management Interventions: Qualitative Study
221,0,A growing body of evidence supports the potential effectiveness of electronic health (eHealth) interventions in managing chronic pain. 
222,0,"However, research on the needs and preferences of patients with chronic pain in relation to eHealth interventions is scarce. "
223,0,Eliciting user input in the development of eHealth interventions may be a crucial step toward developing meaningful interventions for patients for potentially improving treatment outcomes.
224,1,Twenty patients living with chronic pain and five spouses participated in individual interviews. 
225,1,"Semistructured interview guides were used to explore participants' needs, experiences, and challenges in daily life as well as their information and communication technology experiences and preferences for eHealth support interventions. "
226,1,Spouses were recruited and interviewed to gain additional insight into the patients' needs. 
227,1,The study used qualitative thematic analysis.
228,2,The participants were generally experienced technology users and reported using apps regularly. 
229,2,They were mainly in favor of using an eHealth self-management intervention for chronic pain and considered it a potentially acceptable way of gathering knowledge and support for pain management. 
230,2,"The participants expressed the need for obtaining more information and knowledge, establishing a better balance in everyday life, and receiving support for improving communication and social participation. "
231,2,They provided suggestions for the eHealth intervention content and functionality to address these needs. 
232,2,"Accessibility, personalization, and usability were emphasized as important elements for an eHealth support tool. "
233,2,"The participants described an ideal eHealth intervention as one that could be used for support and distraction from pain, at any time or in any situation, regardless of varying pain intensity and concentration capacity."
234,3,This study provides insight into user preferences for eHealth interventions aiming to address self-management for chronic pain. 
235,3,"Participants highlighted important factors to be considered when designing and developing eHealth interventions for self-management of chronic pain, illustrating the importance and benefit of including users in the development of eHealth interventions."
236,4,Acceptability and Feasibility of Implementing Accelorometry-Based Activity Monitors and a Linked Web Portal in an Exercise Referral Scheme: Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial
237,0,Exercise referral schemes (ERSs) are recommended for patients with health conditions or risk factors. 
238,0,"Evidence points to the initial effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such schemes for increasing physical activity, but effects often diminish over time. "
239,0,"Techniques such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and personalized feedback may support motivation for physical activity and maintenance of effects. "
240,0,Wearable technologies could provide an opportunity to integrate motivational techniques into exercise schemes. 
241,0,"However, little is known about acceptability to exercise referral populations or implementation feasibility within exercise referral services."
242,1,We conducted a feasability randomized controlled trial with embedded mixed-methods process evaluation and an exploratory economic analysis. 
243,1,Adults (N=156) were randomized to intervention (plus usual practice; n=88) or usual practice only (n=68). 
244,1,Usual practice was a 16-week structured exercise program. 
245,1,The intervention group additionally received an accelerometry-based activity monitor (MyWellnessKey) and associated Web platform (MyWellnessCloud). 
246,1,The primary outcomes were predefined progression criteria assessing acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and proposed evaluation. 
247,1,"Postal questionnaires were completed at baseline (time 0:T0), 16 weeks (T1), and 12 months after TO (T2). "
248,1,Routine data were accessed at the same time-points. 
249,1,A subsample of intervention participants and scheme staff were interviewed following the initiation of intervention delivery and at T2.
250,2,"Participants were on average aged 56.6 (SD 16.3) years and mostly female (101/156, 64.7%) and white (150/156, 96.2%). "
251,2,"Only 2 of 5 progression criteria were met; recruitment and randomization methods were acceptable to participants, and contamination was low. "
252,2,"However, recruitment and retention rates (11.3% and 67.3%, respectively) fell substantially short of target criteria (20% and 80%, respectively), and disproportionally recruited from the least deprived quintile. "
253,2,Only 57.4% of intervention participants reported receipt of the intervention (below the 80% progression threshold). 
254,2,Less than half reported the intervention to be acceptable at T2. 
255,2,"Participant and staff interviews revealed barriers to intervention delivery and engagement related to the device design as well as context-specific technological challenges, all of which made it difficult to integrate the technology into the service. "
256,2,"Routinely collected health economic measures had substantial missing data, suggesting that other methods for collecting these should be used in future."
257,3,"To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate short- and long-term feasibility and acceptability of integrating wearable technologies into community-based ERSs. "
258,3,"The findings highlight device- and context-specific barriers to doing this in routine practice, with typical exercise referral populations. "
259,3,Key criteria for progression to a full-scale evaluation were not met.
260,4,Assessment of the Relationship Between Ambient Temperature and Home Blood Pressure in Patients From a Web-Based Synchronous Telehealth Care Program: Retrospective Study
261,0,"Decreased ambient temperature significantly increases office blood pressure, but few studies have evaluated the effect of ambient temperature on home blood pressure."
262,1,We recruited patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases from a telehealth care program at a university-affiliated hospital. 
263,1,Blood pressure was measured at home by patients or their caregivers. 
264,1,"We obtained hourly meteorological data for Taipei (temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) for the same time period from the Central Weather Bureau, Taiwan."
265,2,"From 2009 to 2013, we enrolled a total of 253 patients. "
266,2,"Mean patient age was 70.28 (SD 13.79) years, and 66.0% (167/253) of patients were male. "
267,2,"We collected a total of 110,715 home blood pressure measurements. "
268,2,Ambient temperature had a negative linear effect on all 3 home blood pressure parameters after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors and antihypertensive agents. 
269,2,"A 1 degrees C decrease was associated with a 0.5492-mm Hg increase in mean blood pressure, a 0.6841-mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure, and a 0.2709-mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure. "
270,2,"This temperature effect on home blood pressure was less prominent in patients with diabetes or hypertension Antihypertensive agents modified this negative effect of temperature on home blood pressure to some extent, and angiotensin receptor blockers had the most favorable results."
271,3,Short-term exposure to low ambient temperature significantly increased home blood pressure in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. 
272,3,Antihypertensive agents may modify this effect.
273,4,"Causal Relationships Among Pollen Counts, Tweet Numbers, and Patient Numbers for Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Surveillance: Retrospective Analysis"
274,0,"Health-related social media data are increasingly used in disease-surveillance studies, which have demonstrated moderately high correlations between the number of social media posts and the number of patients. "
275,0,"However, there is a need to understand the causal relationship between the behavior of social media users and the actual number of patients in order to increase the credibility of disease surveillance based on social media data."
276,1,"This analysis was conducted using datasets of pollen counts, tweet numbers, and numbers of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis from Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. "
277,1,"We examined daily pollen counts for Japanese cedar (the major cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis in Japan) and hinoki cypress (which commonly complicates seasonal allergic rhinitis) from February 1 to May 31, 2017. "
278,1,"The daily numbers of tweets that included the keyword ""kafunsho"" (or seasonal allergic rhinitis) were calculated between January 1 and May 31, 2017. "
279,1,"Daily numbers of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis from January 1 to May 31, 2017, were obtained from three healthcare institutes that participated in the study. "
280,1,"The Granger causality test was used to examine the causal relationships among pollen count, tweet numbers, and the number of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis from February to May 2017. "
281,1,"To determine if time-variant factors affect these causal relationships, we analyzed the main seasonal allergic rhinitis phase (February to April) when Japanese cedar trees actively produce and release pollen."
282,2,"Increases in pollen count were found to increase the number of tweets during the overall study period (P=.04), but not the main seasonal allergic rhinitis phase (P=.05). "
283,2,"In contrast, increases in pollen count were found to increase patient numbers in both the study period (P=.04) and the main seasonal allergic rhinitis phase (P=.01). "
284,2,"Increases in the number of tweets increased the patient numbers during the main seasonal allergic rhinitis phase (P=.02), but not the overall study period (P=.89). "
285,2,Patient numbers did not affect the number of tweets in both the overall study period (P=.24) and the main seasonal allergic rhinitis phase (P=.47).
286,3,"Understanding the causal relationships among pollen counts, tweet numbers, and numbers of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis is an important step to increasing the credibility of surveillance systems that use social media data. "
287,3,Further in-depth studies are needed to identify the determinants of social media posts described in this exploratory analysis.
288,4,Developing a Decision-Aid Website for Breast Cancer Surgery: An Action Research Approach
289,0,Patients with early-stage breast cancer have numerous options when choosing the type of breast surgery method to be applied. 
290,0,"Each of these options lead to a similar long-term survival rate, but result in significant differences in appearance, function, cost, recurrence rate, and various other relevant considerations. "
291,0,"However, the time available for detailed communication with each patient is often limited in clinics, which puts these women under great psychological stress and can hinder their surgery-related decision making."
292,1,"Using the 4 steps of action research, which involve multigroup teamwork via regular team meetings, the following were performed: (1) Planning: searching, analyzing, and evaluating health websites to consensually decide the major infrastructure; (2) Action: work was performed simultaneously in 4 groups, which consisted of medical information collection and editing, patient interviews and data extraction, webpage content design, and programming to create or host the website; (3) Evaluation: the website was tested by clinical experts and focus groups of former breast cancer patients to assess its effectiveness and pinpoint appropriate improvements; and (4) Reflection: constant dialogue was conducted between the various participants at each step, which was used as the foundation and motivation of next plan-action-evaluation-reflection circle."
293,2,"Using the action research approach, we completed the construction of our website, which includes the following: (1) ""Woman's Voice""-an animated comic depicting the story of a female breast cancer patient with interspersed questions for the users that will help them better empathize with the experience; (2) ""Cancer Information Treasure House""-providing breast cancer surgery-related information through text, tables, pictures and a presentation video; (3) ""Decision-making Simulator""-helping patients think through and check the pros and cons of the different surgical options via visual-based interactions including ""Stairs Climbing"" and ""Fruit of Hope""; and (4) ""Recommended Links""-providing reliable websites for further reference. "
294,2,"Additionally, we have further improved the website based on the feedback received from postsurgery breast cancer patients and clinicians. "
295,2,We hope to continue improving to better meet both the patients' and health providers' needs and become a practical decision-making aid for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.
296,3,"We have created the first breast cancer surgery decision-making assistance tool in Taiwan using a ""Web-based"" and multifunctional website design. "
297,3,"This site aims to provide health care knowledge, psychological healing, and emotional support functions, as well as decision-making capability enhancement simulations. "
298,3,We look forward to assisting breast cancer patients in their decision-making process and expect our website to increase patient's autonomy and improve their communication with clinicians.
299,4,Digital Marketing to Promote Healthy Weight Gain Among Pregnant Women in Alberta: An Implementation Study
300,0,"As the use of digital media for health promotion has become increasingly common, descriptive studies exploring current and innovative marketing strategies can enhance the understanding of effective strategies and best practices."
301,1,"The digital media campaign occurred in 3 phases, each for 8 weeks, and consisted of search engine marketing using Google AdWords and social media advertising through Facebook. "
302,1,"All advertising materials directed users to evidence-based pregnancy-related weight gain content on the Healthy Parents, Healthy Children website."
303,2,"Google Ads received a total of 43,449 impressions, 2522 clicks, and an average click-through rate (CTR) of 5.80%. "
304,2,"Of people who clicked on a Google ad, 78.9% (1989/2522) completed an action on the website. "
305,2,"Across all Facebook advertisements, there were 772,263 impressions, 14,482 clicks, and an average CTR of 1.88%. "
306,2,"The highest-performing advertisement was an image of a group of diverse pregnant women with the headline ""Pregnancy weight is not the same for every woman."""
307,3,This study supports the use of digital marketing as an important avenue for delivering health messages and directing Web users to credible sources of information. 
308,3,"The opportunity to reach large, yet targeted audiences, along with the ability to monitor and evaluate metrics to optimize activities throughout a campaign is a powerful advantage over traditional marketing tactics. "
309,3,Health organizations can use the results and insights of this study to help inform the design and implementation of similar Web-based activities.
310,4,Assessing the Effectiveness of Engaging Patients and Their Families in the Three-Step Fall Prevention Process Across Modalities of an Evidence-Based Fall Prevention Toolkit: An Implementation Science Study
311,0,Patient falls are a major problem in hospitals. 
312,0,"The development of a Patient-Centered Fall Prevention Toolkit, Fall TIPS (Tailoring Interventions for Patient Safety), reduced falls by 25% in acute care hospitals by leveraging health information technology to complete the 3-step fall prevention process-(1) conduct fall risk assessments; (2) develop tailored fall prevention plans with the evidence-based interventions; and (3) consistently implement the plan. "
313,0,We learned that Fall TIPS was most effective when patients and family were engaged in all 3 steps of the fall prevention process. 
314,0,"Over the past decade, our team developed 3 Fall TIPS modalities-the original electronic health record (EHR) version, a laminated paper version that uses color to provide clinical decision support linking patient-specific risk factors to the interventions, and a bedside display version that automatically populates the bedside monitor with the patients' fall prevention plan based on the clinical documentation in the EHR. "
315,0,"However, the relative effectiveness of each Fall TIPS modality for engaging patients and family in the 3-step fall prevention process remains unknown."
316,1,"To assess patient engagement in the 3-step fall prevention process, we conducted random audits with the question, ""Does the patient/family member know their fall prevention plan?"" In addition, audits were conducted to measure adherence, defined by the presence of the Fall TIPS poster at the bedside. "
317,1,Champions from 3 hospitals reported data from April to June 2017 on 6 neurology and 7 medical units. 
318,1,Peer-to-peer feedback to reiterate the best practice for patient engagement was central to data collection.
319,2,"Overall, 1209 audits were submitted for the patient engagement measure and 1401 for the presence of the Fall TIPS poster at the bedside. "
320,2,All units reached 80% adherence for both measures. 
321,2,"While some units maintained high levels of patient engagement and adherence with the poster protocol, others showed improvement over time, reaching clinically significant adherence (>80%) by the final month of data collection."
322,3,"Each Fall TIPS modality effectively facilitates patient engagement in the 3-step fall prevention process, suggesting all 3 can be used to integrate evidence-based fall prevention practices into the clinical workflow. "
323,3,"The 3 Fall TIPS modalities may prove an effective strategy for the spread, allowing diverse institutions to choose the modality that fits with the organizational culture and health information technology infrastructure."
324,4,"Patient and Consumer Safety Risks When Using Conversational Assistants for Medical Information: An Observational Study of Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant"
325,0,"Conversational assistants, such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, are ubiquitous and are beginning to be used as portals for medical services. "
326,0,"However, the potential safety issues of using conversational assistants for medical information by patients and consumers are not understood."
327,1,"Participants were given medical problems to pose to Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant, and asked to determine an action to take based on information from the system. "
328,1,"Assignment of tasks and systems were randomized across participants, and participants queried the conversational assistants in their own words, making as many attempts as needed until they either reported an action to take or gave up. "
329,1,Participant-reported actions for each medical task were rated for patient harm using an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality harm scale.
330,2,Fifty-four subjects completed the study with a mean age of 42 years (SD 18). 
331,2,"Twenty-nine (54%) were female, 31 (57%) Caucasian, and 26 (50%) were college educated. "
332,2,"Only 8 (15%) reported using a conversational assistant regularly, while 22 (41%) had never used one, and 24 (44%) had tried one "" a few times."" Forty-four (82%) used computers regularly. "
333,2,Subjects were only able to complete 168 (43%) of their 394 tasks. 
334,2,"Of these, 49 (29%) reported actions that could have resulted in some degree of patient harm, including 27 (16%) that could have resulted in death."
335,3,Reliance on conversational assistants for actionable medical information represents a safety risk for patients and consumers. 
336,3,Patients should be cautioned to not use these technologies for answers to medical questions they intend to act on without further consultation from a health care provider.
337,4,The Need for Ethnoracial Equity in Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Management: Review and Recommendations
338,0,Artificial intelligence (AI) is developing quickly in the medical field and can benefit both medical staff and patients. 
339,0,"The clinical decision support system Watson for Oncology (WFO) is an outstanding representative AI in the medical field, and it can provide to cancer patients prompt treatment recommendations comparable with ones made by expert oncologists. "
340,0,"WFO is increasingly being used in China, but limited reports on whether WFO is suitable for Chinese patients, especially patients with lung cancer, exist. "
341,0,"Here, we report a retrospective study based on the consistency between the lung cancer treatment recommendations made for the same patient by WFO and by the multidisciplinary team at our center."
342,1,We selected all lung cancer patients who were hospitalized and received antitumor treatment for the first time at the Second Xiangya Hospital Cancer Center from September to December 2017 (N=182). 
343,1,WFO made treatment recommendations for all supported cases (n=149). 
344,1,"If the actual therapeutic regimen (administered by our multidisciplinary team) was recommended or for consideration according to WFO, we defined the recommendations as consistent; if the actual therapeutic regimen was not recommended by WFO or if WFO did not provide the same treatment option, we defined the recommendations as inconsistent. "
345,1,Blinded second round reviews were performed by our multidisciplinary team to reassess the incongruent cases.
346,2,WFO did not support 18.1% (33/182) of recommendations among all cases. 
347,2,"Of the 149 supported cases, 65.8% (98/149) received recommendations that were consistent with the recommendations of our team. "
348,2,"Logistic regression analysis showed that pathological type and staging had significant effects on consistency (P=.004, odds ratio [OR] 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.45 and P<.001, OR 9.5, 95% CI 3.4-26.1, respectively). "
349,2,"Age, gender, and presence of epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations had no effect on consistency. "
350,2,"In 82% (42/51) of the inconsistent cases, our team administered two China-specific treatments, which were different from the recommendations made by WFO but led to excellent outcomes."
351,3,"In China, most of the treatment recommendations of WFO are consistent with the recommendations of the expert group, although a relatively high proportion of cases are still not supported by WFO. "
352,3,"Therefore, WFO cannot currently replace oncologists. "
353,3,"WFO can improve the efficiency of clinical work by providing assistance to doctors, but it needs to learn the regional characteristics of patients to improve its assistive ability."
354,4,Social Media Landscape of the Tertiary Referral Hospitals in China: Observational Descriptive Study
355,0,Social media has penetrated all walks of life. 
356,0,Chinese health care institutions are increasingly utilizing social media to connect with their patients for better health service delivery. 
357,0,"Current research has focused heavily on the use of social media in developed countries, with few studies exploring its usage in the context of developing countries, such as China. "
358,0,"Tertiary hospitals in China are usually located in city centers, and they serve as medical hubs for multiple regions, with comprehensive and specialized medical care being provided. "
359,0,These hospitals are assumed to be the pioneers in creating official social media accounts to connect with their patients due to the fact that they appear to have more resources to support this innovative approach to communication and health care education.
360,1,We examined the best 705 tertiary hospitals in China by collecting and analyzing data regarding their usage of popular Chinese social media apps Sina Weibo and WeChat. 
361,1,"The specific data included (1) hospital characteristics (ie, time since established, number of beds, hospital type, and regions or localities) and (2) status of social media usage regarding two of the most popular local social media platforms in China (ie, time of initiation, number of followers, and number of tweets or posts). "
362,1,We further used a logistic regression model to test the association between hospital characteristics and social media adoption.
363,2,"Of all, 76.2% (537/705) tertiary referral hospitals have created official accounts on either Sina Weibo or WeChat, with the latter being more popular among the two. "
364,2,"In addition, our study suggests that larger and newer hospitals with greater resources are more likely to adopt social media, while hospital type and affiliation with universities are not significant predictors of social media adoption among hospitals."
365,3,Our study demonstrated that hospitals are more inclined to use WeChat. 
366,3,The move by hospitals from Sina Weibo to WeChat indicates that patients are not satisfied by mere communication and that they now place more value on health service delivery. 
367,3,"Meanwhile, utilizing social media requires comprehensive thinking from the hospital side. "
368,3,"Once adopted, hospitals are encouraged to implement specific rules regarding social media usage. "
369,3,"In the future, a long journey still lies ahead for hospitals in terms of operating their official social media accounts."
370,4,Web-Based Versus Usual Care and Other Formats of Decision Aids to Support Prostate Cancer Screening Decisions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
371,0,Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer among men. 
372,0,"Because screening for prostate cancer is a controversial issue, many experts in the field have defended the use of shared decision making using validated decision aids, which can be presented in different formats (eg, written, multimedia, Web). "
373,0,Recent studies have concluded that decision aids improve knowledge and reduce decisional conflict.
374,1,"We searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases up to November 2016. "
375,1,"This search identified randomized controlled trials, which assessed Web-based decision aids for men making a prostate cancer screening decision and reported quality of decision-making outcomes. "
376,1,"Two reviewers independently screened citations for inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. "
377,1,"Using a random-effects model, meta-analyses were conducted pooling results using mean differences (MD), standardized mean differences (SMD), and relative risks (RR)."
378,2,"Of 2406 unique citations, 7 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. "
379,2,"For risk of bias, selective outcome reporting and participant/personnel blinding were mostly rated as unclear due to inadequate reporting. "
380,2,"Based on seven items, two studies had high risk of bias for one item. "
381,2,"Compared to usual care, Web-based decision aids increased knowledge (SMD 0.46; 95% CI 0.18-0.75), reduced decisional conflict (MD -7.07%; 95% CI -9.44 to -4.71), and reduced the practitioner control role in the decision-making process (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31-0.81). "
382,2,"Web-based decision aids compared to printed decision aids yielded no differences in knowledge, decisional conflict, and participation in decision or screening behaviors. "
383,2,"Compared to video decision aids, Web-based decision aids showed lower average knowledge scores (SMD -0.50; 95% CI -0.88 to -0.12) and a slight decrease in prostate-specific antigen screening (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25)."
384,3,"According to this analysis, Web-based decision aids performed similarly to alternative formats (ie, printed, video) for the assessed decision-quality outcomes. "
385,3,"The low cost, readiness, availability, and anonymity of the Web can be an advantage for increasing access to decision aids that support prostate cancer screening decisions among men."
386,4,The Burden of a Remote Trial in a Nursing Home Setting: Qualitative Study
387,0,"Despite an aging population, older adults are typically underrecruited in clinical trials, often because of the perceived burden associated with participation, particularly travel associated with clinic visits. "
388,0,Conducting a clinical trial remotely presents an opportunity to leverage mobile and wearable technologies to bring the research to the patient. 
389,0,"However, the burden associated with shifting clinical research to a remote site requires exploration. "
390,0,"While a remote trial may reduce patient burden, the extent to which this shifts burden on the other stakeholders needs to be investigated."
391,1,"Using results from a grounded analysis of qualitative data, this study explored and characterized the burden associated with a remote trial conducted in a nursing home in Dublin, Ireland. "
392,1,A total of 11 residents were recruited to participate in this trial (mean age: 80 years; age range: 67-93 years). 
393,1,"To support research activities, we also recruited 10 nursing home staff members, including health care assistants, an activities co-ordinator, and senior nurses. "
394,1,This study captured the lived experience of this remote trial among staff and residents and explored the burden associated with participation. 
395,1,"At the end of the trial, a total of 6 residents and 8 members of staff participated in semistructured interviews (n=14). "
396,1,They reviewed clinical data generated by mobile and wearable devices and reflected upon their trial-related experiences.
397,2,Staff reported extensive burden in fulfilling their roles and responsibilities to support activities of the trial. 
398,2,"Among staff, we found eight key characteristics of burden: (1) comprehension, (2) time, (3) communication, (4) emotional load, (5) cognitive load, (6) research engagement, (7) logistical burden, and (8) product accountability. "
399,2,Residents reported comparatively less burden. 
400,2,"Among residents, we found only four key characteristics of burden: (1) comprehension, (2) adherence, (3) emotional load, and (4) personal space."
401,3,A remote trial in a nursing home setting can minimize the burden on residents and enable inclusive participation. 
402,3,"However, it arguably creates additional burden on staff, particularly where they have a role to play in locally supporting and maintaining technology as part of data collection. "
403,3,Future research should examine how to measure and minimize the burden associated with data collection in remote trials.
404,4,An eHealth Capabilities Framework for Graduates and Health Professionals: Mixed-Methods Study
405,0,The demand for an eHealth-ready and adaptable workforce is placing increasing pressure on universities to deliver eHealth education. 
406,0,"At present, eHealth education is largely focused on components of eHealth rather than considering a curriculum-wide approach."
407,1,"A 3-phase, mixed-methods approach incorporated the results of a literature review, focus groups, and a Delphi process to develop a framework of eHealth capability statements."
408,2,"Participants (N= 39) with expertise or experience in eHealth education, practice, or policy provided feedback on the proposed framework, and following the fourth iteration of this process, consensus was achieved. "
409,2,"The final framework consisted of 4 higher-level capability statements that describe the learning outcomes expected of university graduates across the domains of (1) digital health technologies, systems, and policies; (2) clinical practice; (3) data analysis and knowledge creation; and (4) technology implementation and codesign. "
410,2,Across the capability statements are 40 performance cues that provide examples of how these capabilities might be demonstrated.
411,3,The results of this study inform a cross-faculty eHealth curriculum that aligns with workforce expectations. 
412,3,"There is a need for educational curriculum to reinforce existing eHealth capabilities, adapt existing capabilities to make them transferable to novel eHealth contexts, and introduce new learning opportunities for interactions with technologies within education and practice encounters. "
413,3,"As such, the capability framework developed may assist in the application of eHealth by emerging and existing health care professionals. "
414,3,Future research needs to explore the potential for integration of findings into workforce development programs.
415,4,The Korean eHealth Literacy Scale (K-eHEALS): Reliability and Validity Testing in Younger Adults Recruited Online
416,0,"In this digital era, eHealth literacy is an essential skill set to leverage health information available online to promote health outcomes. "
417,0,"South Korea has an advanced health information technology infrastructure, including widespread use of the internet and mobile phones. "
418,0,"A few studies have explored eHealth literacy in South Korea using translated versions of the eHEALS; however, they were not fully validated. "
419,0,A unified reliable and valid assessment tool is critical to assess and enhance the eHealth literacy level across the population.
420,1,"The K-eHEALS was developed based on eHEALS, a widely used tool that measures eHealth literacy, and was validated using a sample of 500 young adults recruited from a pool of a Korean internet survey panel. "
421,1,Content validity was assessed using the content validity index (CVI) for individual items and for scale. 
422,1,Construct validity was examined using exploratory factor analysis and hypothesis testing. 
423,1,The Cronbach alpha coefficient was used to determine the internal consistency and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluable the stability of the measure (n=55).
424,2,Both individual and scale CVIs were acceptable (individual CVIs>0.67; scale CVI=0.83). 
425,2,Single factors accounting for 50.3% of the variance in the scales were extracted revealing the unidimensional latent structure of K-eHEALS. 
426,2,"Hypothesis testing showed significant association between eHealth literacy and hours of internet use per day, supporting the construct validity. "
427,2,"Items of the K-eHEALS were internally consistent (Cronbach alpha=.88) and stable over a 1-month period (r=.754, P<.001)."
428,3,The findings of this study suggest that K-eHEALS is a valid and reliable measure of eHealth literacy in Korean young adults. 
429,3,Additional studies are needed with more diverse groups of adults in Korea.
430,4,Using Fitness Trackers and Smartwatches to Measure Physical Activity in Research: Analysis of Consumer Wrist-Worn Wearables
431,0,New fitness trackers and smartwatches are released to the consumer market every year. 
432,0,"These devices are equipped with different sensors, algorithms, and accompanying mobile apps. "
433,0,"With recent advances in mobile sensor technology, privately collected physical activity data can be used as an addition to existing methods for health data collection in research. "
434,0,"Furthermore, data collected from these devices have possible applications in patient diagnostics and treatment. "
435,0,"With an increasing number of diverse brands, there is a need for an overview of device sensor support, as well as device applicability in research projects."
436,1,We searched for devices and brand names in six wearable device databases. 
437,1,"For each brand, we identified additional devices on official brand websites. "
438,1,"The search was limited to wrist-worn fitness wearables with accelerometers, for which we mapped brand, release year, and supported sensors relevant for fitness tracking. "
439,1,"In addition, we conducted a Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and ClinicalTrials search to determine brand usage in research projects. "
440,1,"Finally, we investigated developer accessibility to the health data collected by identified brands."
441,2,We identified 423 unique devices from 132 different brands. 
442,2,Forty-seven percent of brands released only one device. 
443,2,"Introduction of new brands peaked in 2014, and the highest number of new devices was introduced in 2015. "
444,2,"Sensor support increased every year, and in addition to the accelerometer, a photoplethysmograph, for estimating heart rate, was the most common sensor. "
445,2,"Out of the brands currently available, the five most often used in research projects are Fitbit, Garmin, Misfit, Apple, and Polar. "
446,2,Fitbit is used in twice as many validation studies as any other brands and is registered in ClinicalTrials studies 10 times as often as other brands.
447,3,The wearable landscape is in constant change. 
448,3,"New devices and brands are released every year, promising improved measurements and user experience. "
449,3,"At the same time, other brands disappear from the consumer market for various reasons. "
450,3,Advances in device quality offer new opportunities for research. 
451,3,"However, only a few well-established brands are frequently used in research projects, and even less are thoroughly validated."
452,4,Mode Equivalence of Health Indicators Between Data Collection Modes and Mixed-Mode Survey Designs in Population-Based Health Interview Surveys for Children and Adolescents: Methodological Study
453,0,The implementation of an Internet option in an existing public health interview survey using a mixed-mode design is attractive because of lower costs and faster data availability. 
454,0,"Additionally, mixed-mode surveys can increase response rates and improve sample composition. "
455,0,"However, mixed-mode designs can increase the risk of measurement error (mode effects)."
456,1,"Data were collected for a methodological pilot of the third wave of the ""German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents"". "
457,1,Questionnaires were completed by parents or adolescents. 
458,1,"A population-based sample of 11,140 children and adolescents aged 0-17 years was randomly allocated to 4 survey designs-a single-mode control group with paper-and-pencil questionnaires only (n=970 parents, n=343 adolescents)-and 3 mixed-mode designs, all of which offered Web-based questionnaire options. "
459,1,"In the concurrent mixed-mode design, both questionnaires were offered at the same time (n=946 parents, n=290 adolescents); in the sequential mixed-mode design, the SAQ-Web was sent first, followed by the paper questionnaire along with a reminder (n=854 parents, n=269 adolescents); and in the preselect mixed-mode design, both options were offered and the respondents were asked to request the desired type of questionnaire (n=698 parents, n=292 adolescents). "
460,1,"In total, 3468 questionnaires of parents of children aged 0-17 years (SAQ-Web: n=708; SAQ-paper: n=2760) and 1194 questionnaires of adolescents aged 11-17 years (SAQ-Web: n=299; SAQ-paper: n=895) were analyzed. "
461,1,Sociodemographic characteristics and a broad range of health indicators for children and adolescents were compared by survey design and data collection mode by calculating predictive margins from regression models.
462,2,There were no statistically significant differences in sociodemographic characteristics or health indicators between the single-mode control group and any of the mixed-mode survey designs. 
463,2,Differences in sociodemographic characteristics between SAQ-Web and SAQ-paper were found. 
464,2,"Web respondents were more likely to be male, have higher levels of education, and higher household income compared with paper respondents. "
465,2,"After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, only one of the 38 analyzed health indicators showed different prevalence rates between the data collection modes, with a higher prevalence rate for lifetime alcohol consumption among the online-responding adolescents (P<.001)."
466,3,These results suggest that mode bias is limited in health interview surveys for children and adolescents using a mixed-mode design with Web-based and paper questionnaires.
467,4,The Optimization of an eHealth Solution (Thought Spot) with Transition-Aged Youth in Postsecondary Settings: Participatory Design Research
468,0,"Seventy percent of lifetime cases of mental illness emerge before the age of 24 years, but many youth are unable to access the support and services they require in a timely and appropriate way. "
469,0,"With most youth using the internet, electronic health (eHealth) interventions are promising tools for reaching this population. "
470,0,"Through participatory design research (PDR) engagement methods, Thought Spot, a Web-and mobile-based platform, was redeveloped to facilitate access to mental health services by transition-aged youth (aged 16-29 years) in postsecondary settings."
471,1,"Consistent with the PDR approaches, five student-led workshops, attended by 41 individuals, were facilitated to obtain feedback regarding the platform's usability and functionality and its potential value in a postsecondary setting. "
472,1,"Various creative engagement activities were delivered to gather experiences and opinions, including semistructured focus groups, questionnaires, personas, journey mapping, and a world cafe. "
473,1,Innovative technological features and refinements were also brainstormed during the workshops.
474,2,"By using PDR methods of engagement, participants knew that their ideas and recommendations would be applied. "
475,2,"There was also an overall sense of respect and care integrated into each group, which facilitated an exchange of ideas and suggestions."
476,3,The process of engaging with students to redesign the Thought Spot platform through PDR has been effective. 
477,3,Findings from these workshops will significantly inform new technological features within the app to enable positive help-seeking behaviors among students. 
478,3,These behaviors will be further explored in the second phase that involves a randomized controlled trial.
479,4,Implementing a Mobile Health System to Integrate the Treatment of Addiction Into Primary Care: A Hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness Study
480,0,"Despite the near ubiquity of mobile phones, little research has been conducted on the implementation of mobile health (mHealth) apps to treat patients in primary care. "
481,0,"Although primary care clinicians routinely treat chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes, they rarely treat addiction, a common chronic condition. "
482,0,"Instead, addiction is most often treated in the US health care system, if it is treated at all, in a separate behavioral health system. "
483,0,mHealth could help integrate addiction treatment in primary care.
484,1,"In this implementation research trial, an evidence-based mHealth system named Seva was introduced sequentially over 36 months to a maximum of 100 patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) in each of three federally qualified health centers (FQHCs; primary care clinics that serve patients regardless of their ability to pay). "
485,1,"This paper reports on patient and clinician outcomes organized according to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework."
486,2,The outcomes according to the RE-AIM framework are as follows: Reach-Seva reached 8.31% (268/3226) of appropriate patients. 
487,2,Reach was limited by our ability to pay for phones and data plans for a maximum of 100 patients per clinic. 
488,2,"Effectiveness-Patients who were given Seva had significant improvements in their risky drinking days (44% reduction, (0.7-1.25)/1.25, P=.04), illicit drug-use days (34% reduction, (2.14-3.22)/3.22, P=.01), quality of life, human immunodeficiency virus screening rates, and number of hospitalizations. "
489,2,"Through Seva, patients also provided peer support to one another in ways that are novel in primary care settings. "
490,2,Adoption-Patients sustained high levels of Seva use-between 53% and 60% of the patients at the 3 sites accessed Seva during the last week of the 12-month implementation period. 
491,2,"Among clinicians, use of the technology was less robust than use by patients, with only a handful of clinicians using Seva in each clinic and behavioral health providers making most referrals to Seva in 2 of the 3 clinics. "
492,2,"Implementation-At 2 sites, implementation plans were realized successfully; they were delayed in the third. "
493,2,Maintenance-Use of Seva dropped when grant funding stopped paying for the mobile phones and data plans. 
494,2,"Two of the 3 clinics wanted to maintain the use of Seva, but they struggled to find funding to support this."
495,3,"Implementing an mHealth system can improve care among primary care patients with SUDs, and patients using the system can support one another in their recovery. "
496,3,"Among clinicians, however, implementation requires figuring out how information from the mHealth system will be used and making mHealth data available in the electronic health (eHealth) record. "
497,3,"In addition, paying for an mHealth system remains a challenge."
498,4,Facebook Groups as a Powerful and Dynamic Tool in Medical Education: Mixed-Method Study
499,0,"Social networking sites, in particular Facebook, are not only predominant in students' social life but are to varying degrees interwoven with the medical curriculum. "
500,0,"Particularly, Facebook groups have been identified for their potential in higher education. "
501,0,"However, there is a paucity of data on user types, content, and dynamics of study-related Facebook groups."
502,1,"Using a multi-method approach (interviews, focus groups, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of Facebook posts), we analyzed two representative Facebook groups of medical preclinical semesters at Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) Munich. "
503,1,Facebook primary posts and replies over one semester were extracted and evaluated by using thematic content analysis. 
504,1,We developed and applied a coding scheme for studying the frequency and distribution of these posts. 
505,1,"Additionally, we interviewed students with various degrees of involvement in the groups, as well as ""new minorities,"" students not registered on Facebook."
506,2,Facebook groups seem to have evolved as the main tool for medical students at LMU to complement the curriculum and to discuss study-related content. 
507,2,These Facebook groups are self-organizing and quickly adapt to organizational or subject-related challenges posed by the curriculum. 
508,2,"A wide range of topics is covered, with a dominance of organization-related posts (58.35% [6916/11,853] of overall posts). "
509,2,"By measuring reply rates and comments per category, we were able to identify learning tips and strategies, material sharing, and course content discussions as the most relevant categories. "
510,2,"Rates of adequate replies in these categories ranged between 78% (11/14) and 100% (13/13), and the number of comments per post ranged from 8.4 to 13.7 compared with the average overall reply rate of 68.69% (1167/1699) and 3.9 comments per post. "
511,2,"User typology revealed social media drivers (>30 posts per semester) as engines of group function, frequent users (11-30 posts), and a majority of average users acting rather as consumers or lurkers (1-10 posts)."
512,3,"For the moment, the medical faculty has no active involvement in these groups and therefore no influence on accuracy of information, professionalism, and ethical issues. "
513,3,"Nevertheless, faculty could in the future benefit by extracting relevant information, identifying common problems, and understanding semester-related dynamics."
514,4,Using Facebook to Recruit Young Australian Men Into a Cross-Sectional Human Papillomavirus Study
515,0,Young men can be difficult to engage in health research using traditional methods of recruitment. 
516,0,"Social networking sites are increasingly being used to recruit participants into health research, due to their cost effectiveness, overall generalizability, and wide reach."
517,1,"We recruited male permanent residents of Australia, aged 18 to 35 years, into the HPV in Young Males (HYM) study through targeted advertising placed on Facebook. "
518,1,Consenting participants completed an online questionnaire and provided a self-collected penile swab for HPV DNA detection and genotyping. 
519,1,"We compared sociodemographic characteristics of the study population with those of the general Australian male population, based on Australian 2011 census data."
520,2,"Between February 2015 and February 2017, targeted Facebook advertisements reached 1,523,239 men, resulting in 41,811 clicks through to the study website, with 1072 (2.56%) converting to lodgment of an expression of interest. "
521,2,"Of these, 681 (63.53%) provided written informed consent and 535 (78.6% of recruited participants) completed all the study requirements. "
522,2,"Reasons for participating in the study included altruism, past history of HPV, gaining more knowledge about HPV or the vaccine, working in the health industry, and the monetary compensation. "
523,2,The average advertising cost per completed study participant was Aus $48. 
524,2,"Compared with the census population, HYM study participants were more likely to be Australian born (P<.001), be from Victoria (P=.003) or the Australian Capital Territory (P=.004), reside in a major city (P<.001), and have completed undergraduate (P<.001) or postgraduate education (P<.001). "
525,2,"HYM study participants were less likely to report being a current smoker (P=.03), but were more likely to identify as bisexual or homosexual (294/529, 55.6%, P<.001), than the general population."
526,3,Using Facebook is a feasible and efficient strategy for the recruitment of men from across Australia for HPV testing. 
527,3,This method could be used for monitoring the impact of HPV vaccination. 
528,3,Additional targeting may achieve a sample that is broadly demographically representative of the Australian population. 
529,3,Future research should explore how the sexual risk behavior characteristics of populations recruited through Facebook compare with those of traditional recruitment methods.
530,4,Brain Activation in Response to Personalized Behavioral and Physiological Feedback From Self-Monitoring Technology: Pilot Study
531,0,"The recent surge in commercially available wearable technology has allowed real-time self-monitoring of behavior (eg, physical activity) and physiology (eg, glucose levels). "
532,0,"However, there is limited neuroimaging work (ie, functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) to identify how people's brains respond to receiving this personalized health feedback and how this impacts subsequent behavior."
533,1,"This was a pilot study to assess physical activity, sedentary time, and glucose levels over 14 days in 33 adults (aged 30 to 60 years). "
534,1,"Extracted accelerometry, inclinometry, and interstitial glucose data informed the construction of personalized feedback messages (eg, average number of steps per day). "
535,1,These messages were subsequently presented visually to participants during fMRI. 
536,1,Participant physical activity levels and sedentary time were assessed again for 8 days following exposure to this personalized feedback.
537,0,The use of online communities to promote end user involvement and co-creation in the product and service innovation process is well documented in the marketing and management literature. 
538,0,"Whereas online communities are widely used for health care service provision and peer-to-peer support, only little is known about how they could be integrated into the health care innovation process."
539,1,A descriptive qualitative research design was used. 
540,1,Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with nine community managers. 
541,1,"To complement the interview data, additional information was retrieved from the communities in the form of structural information (number of registered users, number and names of topic areas covered by the forum) and administrative information (terms and conditions and privacy statements, forum rules). "
542,1,Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
543,2,Our results highlight two main aspects: peer-to-peer knowledge co-creation and types of collaboration with external actors. 
544,2,"Although community managers strongly encouraged peer-to-peer knowledge co-creation, our findings indicated that these activities were not common practice in the communities under investigation. "
545,2,"In fact, much of what related to co-creation, prototyping, and product development was still perceived to be directed by professionals and experts. "
546,2,Community managers described the role of their respective communities as informing this process rather than a driving force. 
547,2,"The role of community members as advisors to researchers, health care professionals, and businesses was discussed in the context of types of collaboration with external actors. "
548,2,"According to the community managers, most of the external inquiries related to research projects of students or health care professionals in training, who often joined a community for the sole purpose of recruiting participants for their research. "
549,2,"Despite this unilateral form of knowledge co-creation, community managers acknowledged the mere interest of these user groups as beneficial, as long as their interest was not purely financially motivated. "
550,2,"Being able to contribute to advancing research, improving products, and informing the planning and design of health care services were described as some of the key motivations to engage with external stakeholders."
551,3,"This paper draws attention to the currently under-investigated role of online communities as platforms for collaboration and co-creation between patients, health care professionals, researchers, and businesses. "
552,3,It describes community managers' views on and experiences with knowledge co-creation and provides recommendations on how these activities can be leveraged to foster knowledge co-creation in health care. 
553,3,"Engaging in knowledge co-creation with online health communities may ultimately help to inform the planning and design of products, services, and research activities that better meet the actual needs of those living with a disability."
554,4,Self-Monitoring Kidney Function Post Transplantation: Reliability of Patient-Reported Data
555,0,The high frequency of outpatient visits after kidney transplantation is burdensome to both the recovering patient and health care capacity. 
556,0,Self-monitoring kidney function offers a promising strategy to reduce the number of these outpatient visits.
557,1,"For self-monitoring creatinine, each participant received a StatSensor Xpress-i Creatinine Meter and related test material. "
558,1,"For self-monitoring blood pressure, each participant received a Microlife WatchBP Home, an oscillometric device for blood pressure self-measurement on the upper arm. "
559,1,Both devices had a memory function and the option to download stored values to a computer. 
560,1,"During the first year post transplantation, 54 patients registered their self-measured creatinine values in a Web-based Self-Management Support System (SMSS) which provided automatic feedback on the registered values (eg, seek contact with hospital). "
561,1,Values registered in the SMSS were compared with those logged automatically in the creatinine device to study reliability of registered data. 
562,1,Adherence to measurement frequency was determined by comparing the number of requested with the number of performed measurements. 
563,1,"To study adherence to provided feedback, SMSS-logged feedback and information from the electronic hospital files were analyzed."
564,2,Level of adherence was highest during months 2-4 post transplantation with over 90% (42/47) of patients performing at least 75% of the requested measurements. 
565,2,"Overall, 87.00% (3448/3963) of all registered creatinine values were entered correctly, although values were often registered several days later. "
566,2,"If (the number of) measured and registered values deviated, the mean of registered creatinine values was significantly lower than what was measured, suggesting active selection of lower creatinine values. "
567,2,"Adherence to SMSS feedback ranged from 53% (14/24) to 85% (33/39), depending on the specific feedback."
568,3,Patients' tendency to postpone registration and to select lower creatinine values for registration and the suboptimal adherence to the feedback provided by the SMSS might challenge safety. 
569,3,"This should be well considered when designing self-monitoring care systems, for example by ensuring that self-measured data are transferred automatically to an SMSS."
570,4,Using New and Emerging Technologies to Identify and Respond to Suicidality Among Help-Seeking Young People: A Cross-Sectional Study
571,0,Suicidal thoughts are common among young people presenting to face-to-face and online mental health services. 
572,0,The early detection and rapid response to these suicidal thoughts and other suicidal behaviors is a priority for suicide prevention and early intervention efforts internationally. 
573,0,Establishing how best to use new and emerging technologies to facilitate person-centered systematic assessment and early intervention for suicidality is crucial to these efforts.
574,1,A total of 232 young people in the age range of 16-25 years were recruited from either a primary mental health care service or online in the community. 
575,1,Each young person used the Synergy Online System and completed an initial clinical assessment online before their face-to-face or online clinical appointment. 
576,1,A suicidality escalation protocol was used to identify and respond to current and previous suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
577,2,"A total of 153 young people (66%, 153/232) reported some degree of suicidality and were provided with a real-time alert online. "
578,2,"Further levels of escalation (email or phone contact and clinical review) were initiated for the 35 young people (15%, 35/232) reporting high suicidality. "
579,2,Higher levels of psychological distress (P<.001) and a current alcohol or substance use problem (P=.02) predicted any level of suicidality compared with no suicidality. 
580,2,"Furthermore, predictors of high suicidality compared with low suicidality were higher levels of psychological distress (P=.01), psychosis-like symptoms in the last 12 months (P=.01), a previous mental health problem (P=.01), and a history of suicide planning or attempts (P=.001)."
581,3,This study demonstrates the use of new and emerging technologies to facilitate the systematic assessment and detection of help-seeking young people presenting with suicidality. 
582,3,This protocol empowered the young person by suggesting pathways to care that were based on their current needs. 
583,3,"The protocol also enabled an appropriate and timely response from service providers for young people reporting high suicidality that was associated with additional comorbid issues, including psychosis-like symptoms, and a history of suicide plans and attempts."
584,4,Preventing Prescription Drug Misuse in Work Settings: Efficacy of a Brief Intervention in Health Consciousness
585,0,It is becoming more commonplace for employees to use prescription medication outside of intended use. 
586,0,Opioid and other prescription misuse has implications for the health and productivity of workers. 
587,0,Easy-to-access webinars that help employees learn about alternatives to prescription use may decrease risk.
588,1,Employees from a variety of workplaces filled out pre-and post-questionnaires upon completion of a one-hour long intervention.
589,2,A total of 114 participants completed the pre-and post-questionnaires. 
590,2,"Results showed that, compared with before the training, participants reported significantly more knowledge about prescription drug misuse and alternatives to prescription drug use after the training (t(113)=7.91, P<.001). "
591,2,"Moreover, the medium of presentation (ie, face-to-face vs webinar) did not significantly impact effectiveness of the training (F-1.98=1.15, P=.29)."
592,3,"In both webinar and classroom formats, participants gained knowledge about alternatives to prescription drug use. "
593,3,This intervention appears to be beneficial to employees and assists in the awareness of prescription drug use in general and in the workplace.
594,4,"Desirable Components for a Customized, Home-Based, Digital Care-Management App for Children and Young People With Long-Term, Chronic Conditions: A Qualitative Exploration"
595,0,"Mobile apps for mobile phones and tablet devices are widely used by children and young people aged 0-18 years with long-term health conditions, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), and their healthy peers for social networking or gaming. "
596,0,They are also poised to become a major source of health guidance. 
597,0,"However, app development processes that are coproduced, rigorously developed, and evaluated to provide tailored, condition-specific, practical advice on day-to-day care management are seldom systematic or sufficiently described to enable replication. "
598,0,"Furthermore, attempts to extrapolate to the real world are hampered by a poor understanding of the effects of key elements of app components. "
599,0,"Therefore, effective and cost-effective novel, digital apps that will effectively and safely support care management are critical and timely. "
600,0,"To inform development of such an app for children with CKD, a user requirements-gathering exercise was first needed."
601,1,"Using age-and developmentally appropriate methods, we interviewed 36 participants: 5-10-year-olds (n=6), 11-14-year-olds (n=6), 15-18-year-olds (n=5), mothers (n=10), fathers (n=2), and health care professionals (n=7). "
602,1,Data were analyzed using Framework Analysis and behavior change theories.
603,2,"Of the 27 interviews, 19 (70%) interviews were individual and 8 (30%) were joint-5 out of 8 (63%) joint interviews were with a child or young person and their parent, 1 out of 8 (13%) were with a child and both parents, and 2 out of 8 (25%) were with 2 professionals. "
604,2,"Three key themes emerged to inform development of a software requirement specification for a future home-based, digital care-management app intervention: (1) Gaps in current online information and support, (2) Difficulties experienced by children with a long-term condition, and (3) Suggestions for a digital care-management app. "
605,2,"Reported gaps included the fact that current online information is not usually appropriate for children as it is ""dry"" and ""boring,""could be ""scary,"" and was either hard to understand or not relevant to individuals' circumstances. "
606,2,"For children, searching online was much less accessible than using a professional-endorsed mobile app. "
607,2,"Children also reported difficulty explaining their condition to others, maintaining treatment adherence, coping with feeling isolated, and with trying to live a ""normal"" life. "
608,2,"There was recognition that a developmentally appropriate, CKD-specific app could support the process of explaining the condition to healthy peers, reducing isolation, adhering to care-management plans, and living a ""normal"" life. "
609,2,"Participants recommended a range of media and content to include in a tailored, interactive, age-and developmentally appropriate app. "
610,2,"For example, the user would be able to enter their age and diagnosis so that only age-appropriate and condition-specific content is displayed."
611,3,"Future development of a digital app that meets the identified information and support needs and preferences of children with CKD will maximize its utility, thereby augmenting CKD caregiving and optimizing outcomes."
612,4,"A Review of the Theoretical Basis, Effects, and Cost Effectiveness of Online Smoking Cessation Interventions in the Netherlands: A Mixed-Methods Approach"
613,0,Tobacco smoking is a worldwide public health problem. 
614,0,"In 2015, 26.3% of the Dutch population aged 18 years and older smoked, 74.4% of them daily. "
615,0,More and more people have access to the Internet worldwide; approximately 94% of the Dutch population have online access. 
616,0,Internet-based smoking cessation interventions (online cessation interventions) provide an opportunity to tackle the scourge of tobacco.
617,1,"A mixed-methods approach was used to identify Dutch online cessation interventions, using (1) a scientific literature search, (2) a grey literature search, and (3) expert input. "
618,1,"For the scientific literature, the Cochrane review was used and updated by two independent researchers (n=651 identified studies), screening titles, abstracts, and then full-text studies between 2013 and 2016 (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE). "
619,1,"For the grey literature, the researchers conducted a Google search (n=100 websites), screening for titles and first pages. "
620,1,"Including expert input, this resulted in six interventions identified in the scientific literature and 39 interventions via the grey literature. "
621,1,"Extracted data included effectiveness, cost effectiveness, theoretical factors, and behavior change techniques used."
622,2,"Overall, many interventions (45 identified) were offered. "
623,2,"Of the 45 that we identified, only six that were included in trials provided data on effectiveness. "
624,2,Four of these were shown to be effective and cost effective. 
625,2,"In the scientific literature, 83% (5/6) of these interventions included changing attitudes, providing social support, increasing self-efficacy, motivating smokers to make concrete action plans to prepare their attempts to quit and to cope with challenges, supporting identity change and advising on changing routines, coping, and medication use. "
626,2,"In all, 50% (3/6) of the interventions included a reward for abstinence. "
627,2,"Interventions identified in the grey literature were less consistent, with inclusion of each theoretical factor ranging from 31% to 67% and of each behavior change technique ranging from 28% to 54%."
628,3,"Although the Internet may provide the opportunity to offer various smoking cessation programs, the user is left bewildered as far as efficacy is concerned, as most of these data are not available nor offered to the smokers. "
629,3,Clear regulations about the effectiveness of these interventions need to be devised to avoid disappointment and failed quitting attempts. 
630,3,"Thus, there is a need for policy regulations to regulate the proliferation of these interventions and to foster their quality in the Netherlands."
631,4,"Using Mobile Sensing to Test Clinical Models of Depression, Social Anxiety, State Affect, and Social Isolation Among College Students"
632,0,"Research in psychology demonstrates a strong link between state affect (moment-to-moment experiences of positive or negative emotionality) and trait affect (eg, relatively enduring depression and social anxiety symptoms), and a tendency to withdraw (eg, spending time at home). "
633,0,"However, existing work is based almost exclusively on static, self-reported descriptions of emotions and behavior that limit generalizability. "
634,0,"Despite adoption of increasingly sophisticated research designs and technology (eg, mobile sensing using a global positioning system [GPS]), little research has integrated these seemingly disparate forms of data to improve understanding of how emotional experiences in everyday life are associated with time spent at home, and whether this is influenced by depression or social anxiety symptoms."
635,1,We recruited 72 undergraduate participants from a southeast university in the United States. 
636,1,We assessed depression and social anxiety symptoms using self-report instruments at baseline. 
637,1,An app (Sensus) installed on participants' personal mobile phones repeatedly collected in situ self-reported state affect and GPS location data for up to 2 weeks. 
638,1,Time spent at home was a proxy for social isolation.
639,2,"We tested separate models examining the relations between state affect and time spent at home, with levels of depression and social anxiety as moderators. "
640,2,Models differed only in the temporal links examined. 
641,2,"One model focused on associations between changes in affect and time spent at home within short, 4-hour time windows. "
642,2,"The other 3 models focused on associations between mean-level affect within a day and time spent at home (1) the same day, (2) the following day, and (3) the previous day. "
643,2,"Overall, we obtained many of the expected main effects (although there were some null effects), in which higher social anxiety was associated with more time or greater likelihood of spending time at home, and more negative or less positive affect was linked to longer homestay. "
644,2,"Interactions indicated that, among individuals higher in social anxiety, higher negative affect and lower positive affect within a day was associated with greater likelihood of spending time at home the following day."
645,3,Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of modeling the relationship between affect and homestay using fine-grained GPS data. 
646,3,"Although these findings must be replicated in a larger study and with clinical samples, they suggest that integrating repeated state affect assessments in situ with continuous GPS data can increase understanding of how actual homestay is related to affect in everyday life and to symptoms of anxiety and depression."
647,4,Readiness for Delivering Digital Health at Scale: Lessons From a Longitudinal Qualitative Evaluation of a National Digital Health Innovation Program in the United Kingdom
648,0,Digital health has the potential to support care delivery for chronic illness. 
649,0,"Despite positive evidence from localized implementations, new technologies have proven slow to become accepted, integrated, and routinized at scale."
650,1,"The study was a longitudinal qualitative, multi-stakeholder, implementation study. "
651,1,"The methods included interviews (n=125) with key implementers, focus groups with consumers and patients (n=7), project meetings (n=12), field work or observation in the communities (n=16), health professional survey responses (n=48), and cross program documentary evidence on implementation (n=215). "
652,1,We used a sociological theory called normalization process theory (NPT) and a longitudinal (3 years) qualitative framework analysis approach. 
653,1,This work did not study a single intervention or population. 
654,1,"Instead, we evaluated the processes (of designing and delivering digital health), and our outcomes were the identified barriers and facilitators to delivering and mainstreaming services and products within the mixed sector digital health ecosystem."
655,2,"We identified three main levels of issues influencing readiness for digital health: macro (market, infrastructure, policy), meso (organizational), and micro (professional or public). "
656,2,"Factors hindering implementation included: lack of information technology (IT) infrastructure, uncertainty around information governance, lack of incentives to prioritize interoperability, lack of precedence on accountability within the commercial sector, and a market perceived as difficult to navigate. "
657,2,"Factors enabling implementation were: clinical endorsement, champions who promoted digital health, and public and professional willingness."
658,3,"Although there is receptiveness to digital health, barriers to mainstreaming remain. "
659,3,"Our findings suggest greater investment in national and local infrastructure, implementation of guidelines for the safe and transparent use and assessment of digital health, incentivization of interoperability, and investment in upskilling of professionals and the public would help support the normalization of digital health. "
660,3,"These findings will enable researchers, health care practitioners, and policy makers to understand the current landscape and the actions required in order to prepare the market and accelerate uptake, and use of digital health and wellness services in context and at scale."
661,4,"IntelliCare: An Eclectic, Skills-Based App Suite for the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety"
662,0,Digital mental health tools have tended to use psychoeducational strategies based on treatment orientations developed and validated outside of digital health. 
663,0,These features do not map well to the brief but frequent ways that people use mobile phones and mobile phone apps today. 
664,0,"To address these challenges, we developed a suite of apps for depression and anxiety called IntelliCare, each developed with a focused goal and interactional style. "
665,0,IntelliCare apps prioritize interactive skills training over education and are designed for frequent but short interactions.
666,1,"Participants, recruited through a health care system, Web-based and community advertising, and clinical research registries, were included in this single-arm trial if they had elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety. "
667,1,Participants had access to the 14 IntelliCare apps from Google Play and received 8 weeks of coaching on the use of IntelliCare. 
668,1,"Coaching included an initial phone call plus 2 or more texts per week over the 8 weeks, with some participants receiving an additional brief phone call. "
669,1,Primary outcomes included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety. 
670,1,Participants were compensated up to US $90 for completing all assessments; compensation was not for app use or treatment engagement.
671,2,"Of the 99 participants who initiated treatment, 90.1% (90/99) completed 8 weeks. "
672,2,Participants showed substantial reductions in the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (P<.001). 
673,2,Participants used the apps an average of 195.4 (SD 141) times over the 8 weeks. 
674,2,"The average length of use was 1.1 (SD 2.1) minutes, and 95% of participants downloaded 5 or more of the IntelliCare apps."
675,3,This study supports the IntelliCare framework of providing a suite of skills-focused apps that can be used frequently and briefly to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. 
676,3,"The IntelliCare system is elemental, allowing individual apps to be used or not used based on their effectiveness and utility, and it is eclectic, viewing treatment strategies as elements that can be applied as needed rather than adhering to a singular, overarching, theoretical model."
677,4,"The Associations Among Individual Factors, eHealth Literacy, and Health-Promoting Lifestyles Among College Students"
678,0,eHealth literacy is gaining importance for maintaining and promoting health. 
679,0,"Studies have found that individuals with high eHealth literacy are more likely to adopt healthy eating, exercise, and sleep behaviors. "
680,0,"In addition, previous studies have shown that various individual factors (eg, frequency of seeking information on health issues, degree of health concern, frequency of eating organic food, and students' college major) are associated with eHealth literacy and health-promoting lifestyles. "
681,0,"Nevertheless, few studies have explored the associations among individual factors, eHealth literacy, and health-promoting lifestyles among college students. "
682,0,"Moreover, there is a lack of studies that focus on eHealth literacy as a predictor of psychological health behaviors."
683,1,"The eHealth Literacy Scale is a 12-item instrument designed to measure college students' functional, interactive, and critical eHealth literacy. "
684,1,"The Health-promoting Lifestyle Scale is a 23-item instrument developed to measure college students' self-actualization, health responsibility, interpersonal support, exercise, nutrition, and stress management. "
685,1,A nationally representative sample of 556 valid college students in Taiwan was surveyed. 
686,1,"A questionnaire was administered to gather the respondents' background information, including the frequency of seeking information on health issues, the frequency of eating organic food, the degree of health concern, and the students' major. "
687,1,"We then conducted a multiple regression analysis to examine the associations among individual factors, eHealth literacy, and health-promoting lifestyles."
688,2,"The study found that factors such as medical majors (t(550=)2.47-7.55, P<.05) and greater concern with health (t(550)=2.15-9.01, P<.05) predicted college students' 4-6 health-promoting lifestyle dimensions and the 3 dimensions of eHealth literacy. "
689,2,"Moreover, critical eHealth literacy positively predicted all 6 health-promoting lifestyle dimensions (t(547)=2.66-7.28, P<.01), functional literacy positively predicted 2 dimensions (t(547)= 2.32-2.98, P<.05), and interactive literacy predicted only the self-actualization dimension (t(547)= 2.81, P<.01)."
690,3,"This study found that participants who majored in medical fields had greater concern with their health and frequently sought health information, exhibited better eHealth literacy, and had a positive health-promoting lifestyle. "
691,3,"Moreover, this study showed that college students with a higher critical eHealth literacy engaged better in health-promoting activities than those with functional and interactive literacy."
692,4,Reimagining Human Research Protections for 21st Century Science
693,0,Evolving research practices and new forms of research enabled by technological advances require a redesigned research oversight system that respects and protects human research participants.
694,1,A total of 11 researchers and institutional review board (IRB) professionals participated in a January 2015 design thinking workshop to develop ideas for redesigning the IRB system.
695,2,Ideas in 5 major domains were generated. 
696,2,"The areas of focus were (1) improving the consent form and process, (2) empowering researchers to protect their participants, (3) creating a system to learn from mistakes, (4) improving IRB efficiency, and (5) facilitating review of research that leverages technological advances."
697,3,We describe the impetus for and results of a design thinking workshop to reimagine a human research protections system that is responsive to 21st century science.
698,4,"Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome by Telemedically Supported Paramedics Compared With Physician-Based Treatment: A Prospective, Interventional, Multicenter Trial"
699,0,Prehospital treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in German emergency medical services (EMSs) is reserved for EMS physicians due to legal issues.
700,1,"After approval by the ethics committee and trial registration, a one-year study phase was started in August 2012 with 5 ambulances, telemedically equipped and staffed with paramedics, in 4 German EMS districts. "
701,1,The paramedics could contact an EMS-physician-staffed telemedicine center. 
702,1,"After initiation of an audio connection, real-time data transmission was automatically established. "
703,1,"If required, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and still pictures could be sent. "
704,1,Video was streamed from inside each ambulance. 
705,1,"All drugs, including opioids, were delegated to the paramedics based on standardized, predefined algorithms. "
706,1,"To compare telemedically-delegated medication and treatment in ACS cases with regular EMS missions, a matched pair analysis with historical controls was performed."
707,2,Teleconsultation was performed on 150 patients having a cardiovascular emergency. 
708,2,"In 39 cases, teleconsultation was started due to suspected ACS. "
709,2,No case had a medical complication. 
710,2,"Correct handling of 12-lead ECG was performed equally between the groups (study group, n=38 vs control group, n=39, P>.99). "
711,2,"There were no differences in correct handling of intravenous administration of acetylsalicylic acid, heparin, or morphine between both the groups (study group vs control group): acetylsalicylic acid, n=31 vs n=33, P=.73; unfractionated heparin, n=34 vs n=33, P>.99; morphine, n=29 vs n=27, P=.50. "
712,2,"The correct handling of oxygen administration was significantly higher in the study group (n=29 vs n=18, P=.007)."
713,3,Telemedical delegation of guideline conform medication and therapy by paramedics in patients with ACS and was found to be feasible and safe. 
714,3,"The quality of guideline-adherent therapy was not significantly different in both the groups except for the correct administration of oxygen, which was significantly higher in the study group."
715,4,An Ecological Momentary Intervention for Smoking Cessation: Evaluation of Feasibility and Effectiveness
716,0,"Despite substantial public health progress in reducing the prevalence of smoking in the United States overall, smoking among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults remains high."
717,1,"Participants were recruited from a safety-net hospital smoking cessation clinic in Dallas, Texas, and were followed for 13 weeks. "
718,1,"All participants received standard smoking cessation clinic care (ie, group counseling and cessation pharmacotherapy) and a smartphone with a novel smoking cessation app (ie, Smart-T). "
719,1,"The Smart-T app prompted 5 daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) for 3 weeks (ie, 1 week before cessation and 2 weeks after cessation). "
720,1,"During the precessation period, EMAs were followed by messages that focused on planning and preparing for the quit attempt. "
721,1,"During the postcessation period, participant responses to EMAs drove an algorithm that tailored messages to the current level of smoking lapse risk and currently present lapse triggers (eg, urge to smoke, stress). "
722,1,"Smart-T offered additional intervention features on demand (eg, one-click access to the tobacco cessation quitline; ""Quit Tips"" on coping with urges to smoke, mood, and stress)."
723,2,"Participants (N= 59) were 52.0 (SD 7.0) years old, 54% (32/59) female, and 53% (31/59) African American, and 70% (40/57) had annual household income less than US $16,000. "
724,2,Participants smoked 20.3 (SD 11.6) cigarettes per day and had been smoking for 31.6 (SD 10.9) years. 
725,2,"Twelve weeks after the scheduled quit date, 20% (12/59) of all participants were biochemically confirmed abstinent. "
726,2,Participants responded to 87% of all prompted EMAs and received approximately 102 treatment messages over the 3-week EMA period. 
727,2,"Most participants (83%, 49/59) used the on-demand app features. "
728,2,Individuals with greater nicotine dependence and minority race used the Quit Tips feature more than their counterparts. 
729,2,"Greater use of the Quit Tips feature was linked to nonabstinence at the 2 (P=.02), 4 (P<.01), and 12 (P=.03) week follow-up visits. "
730,2,"Most participants reported that they actually used or implemented the tailored app-generated messages and suggestions (83%, 49/59); the app-generated messages were helpful (97%, 57/59); they would like to use the app in the future if they were to lapse (97%, 57/59); and they would like to refer friends who smoke to use the Smart-T app (85%, 50/59). "
731,2,"A minority of participants (15%, 9/59) reported that the number of daily assessments (ie, 5) was ""too high."""
732,3,"This novel just-in-time adaptive intervention delivered an intensive intervention (ie, 102 messages over a 3-week period), was well-liked, and was perceived as helpful and useful by socioeconomically disadvantaged adults who were seeking smoking cessation treatment. "
733,3,Smartphone apps may be used to increase treatment exposure and may ultimately reduce tobacco-related health disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults.
734,4,Association Between Physician Online Rating and Quality of Care
735,0,"Patients are increasingly using physician review websites to find ""a good doctor."" However, to our knowledge, no prior study has examined the relationship between online rating and an accepted measure of quality."
736,1,"In the US states of California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania-which together account for over one-quarter of the US population-risk-adjusted mortality rates are publicly reported for all cardiac surgeons. "
737,1,"From these reports, we recorded the 30-day mortality rate following isolated CABG surgery for each surgeon practicing in these 5 states. "
738,1,"For each surgeon listed in the state reports, we then conducted Internet-based searches to determine his or her online rating(s). "
739,1,We then assessed the relationship between physician online rating and risk-adjusted mortality rate.
740,2,"Of the 614 surgeons listed in the state reports, we found 96.1% (590/614) to be rated online. "
741,2,"The average online rating was 4.4 out of 5, and 78.7% (483/614) of the online ratings were 4 or higher. "
742,2,"The median number of reviews used to formulate each rating was 4 (range 1-89), and 32.70% (503/1538) of the ratings were based on 2 or fewer reviews. "
743,2,"Overall, there was no correlation between surgeon online rating and risk-adjusted mortality rate (P=.13). "
744,2,"Risk-adjusted mortality rates were similar for surgeons across categories of average online rating (P>.05), and surgeon average online rating was similar across quartiles of surgeon risk-adjusted mortality rate (P>.05)."
745,3,"In this study of cardiac surgeons practicing in the 5 US states that publicly report outcomes, we found no correlation between online rating and risk-adjusted mortality rates. "
746,3,Patients using online rating websites to guide their choice of physician should recognize that these ratings may not reflect actual quality of care as defined by accepted metrics.
747,4,Infusing Technology Into Perinatal Home Visitation in the United States for Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence: Exploring the Interpretive Flexibility of an mHealth Intervention
748,0,Intimate partner violence (IPV) is common during pregnancy and the postpartum. 
749,0,Perinatal home visitation provides favorable conditions in which to identify and support women affected by IPV. 
750,0,"However, the use of mHealth for delivering IPV interventions in perinatal home visiting has not been explored."
751,1,"We used purposive sampling, using maximum variation, to select women enrolled in a US-based randomized controlled trial of the DOVE intervention for semistructured interviews. "
752,1,Selection criteria were discussed with the trial research team and 32 women were invited to participate. 
753,1,"We invited 45 home visitors at the 8 study sites to participate in an interview, along with the 2 DOVE program designers. "
754,1,Nonparticipant observations of home visits with trial participants who chose not to participate in semistructured interviews were undertaken.
755,2,"We conducted 51 interviews with 26 women, 23 home visiting staff at rural and urban sites, and the 2 DOVE program designers. "
756,2,We conducted 4 nonparticipant observations. 
757,2,"Among 18 IPV-positive women, 7 used the computer tablet and 11 used the home visitor method. "
758,2,"Among 8 IPV-negative women, 7 used the home visitor method. "
759,2,The computer tablet was viewed as a safe and confidential way for abused women to disclose their experiences without fear of being judged. 
760,2,"The meanings that the DOVE technology held for home visitors and women led to its construction as either an impersonal artifact that was an impediment to discussion of IPV or a conduit through which interpersonal connection could be deepened, thereby facilitating discussion about IPV. "
761,2,"Women's and home visitors' comfort with either method of screening was positively influenced by factors such as having established trust and rapport, as well as good interpersonal communication. "
762,2,The technology helped reduce the anticipated stigma associated with disclosing abuse. 
763,2,"The didactic intervention video was a limiting feature, as the content could not be tailored to accommodate the fluidity of women's circumstances."
764,3,Users and developers of technology-based IPV interventions need to consider the context in which they are being embedded and the importance of the patient-provider relationship in promoting behavior change in order to realize the full benefits. 
765,3,"An mHealth approach can and should be used as a tool for initiating discussion about IPV, assisting women in enhancing their safety and exploring help-seeking options. "
766,3,"However, training for home visitors is required to ensure that a computer tablet is used to complement and enhance the therapeutic relationship."
767,4,Health Literacy and Health Information Technology Adoption: The Potential for a New Digital Divide
768,0,Approximately one-half of American adults exhibit low health literacy and thus struggle to find and use health information. 
769,0,Low health literacy is associated with negative outcomes including overall poorer health. 
770,0,"Health information technology (HIT) makes health information available directly to patients through electronic tools including patient portals, wearable technology, and mobile apps. "
771,0,"The direct availability of this information to patients, however, may be complicated by misunderstanding of HIT privacy and information sharing."
772,1,"Participants were 4974 American adults (n=2102, 42.26% male, n=3146, 63.25% white, average age 43.5, SD 16.7 years). "
773,1,"Participants completed the Newest Vital Sign measure of health literacy and indicated their actual use of HIT tools, as well as the perceived ease of use and usefulness of these applications. "
774,1,"Participants also answered questions regarding information privacy and institutional trust, as well as demographic items."
775,2,"Cross-tabulation analysis indicated that adequate versus less than adequate health literacy was significantly associated with use of fitness apps (P=.02), nutrition apps (P<.001), activity trackers (P<.001), and patient portals (P<.001). "
776,2,"Additionally, greater health literacy was significantly associated with greater perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness across all HIT tools after controlling for demographics. "
777,2,"Regarding privacy perceptions of HIT and institutional trust, patients with greater health literacy often demonstrated decreased privacy perceptions for HIT tools including fitness apps (P<.001) and nutrition apps (P<.001). "
778,2,"Health literacy was negatively associated with trust in government (P<.001), media (P<.001), and technology companies (P<.001). "
779,2,"Interestingly, health literacy score was positively associated with trust in health care (P=.03)."
780,3,"Patients with low health literacy were less likely to use HIT tools or perceive them as easy or useful, but they perceived information on HIT as private. "
781,3,"Given the fast-paced evolution of technology, there is a pressing need to further the understanding of how health literacy is related to HIT app adoption and usage. "
782,3,"This will ensure that all users receive the full health benefits from these technological advances, in a manner that protects health information privacy, and that users engage with organizations and providers they trust."
783,4,Web-Based Virtual Microscopy of Digitized Blood Slides for Malaria Diagnosis: An Effective Tool for Skills Assessment in Different Countries and Environments
784,0,Morphological examination of blood films remains the reference standard for malaria diagnosis. 
785,0,Supporting the skills required to make an accurate morphological diagnosis is therefore essential. 
786,0,"However, providing support across different countries and environments is a substantial challenge."
787,1,"From Giemsa stained thick and thin blood films, 56 large high-resolution digital slides were prepared, using high-quality image capture and 63x oil-immersion objective lens. "
788,1,The individual images were combined using the photomerge function of Adobe Photoshop and then adjusted to ensure resolution and reproduction of essential diagnostic features. 
789,1,Web delivery employed the Digital Slidebox platform allowing digital microscope viewing facilities and image annotation with data gathering from participants.
790,2,Engagement was high with images viewed by 38 participants in five countries in a range of environments and a mean completion rate of 42/56 cases. 
791,2,"The rate of parasite detection was 78% and accuracy of species identification was 53%, which was comparable with results of similar studies using glass slides. "
792,2,Data collection allowed users to compare performance with other users over time or for each individual case.
793,3,"Overall, these results demonstrate that users worldwide can effectively engage with the system in a range of environments, with the potential to enhance personal performance through education, external quality assessment, and personal professional development, especially in regions where educational resources are difficult to access."
794,4,The Effect of a Freely Available Flipped Classroom Course on Health Care Worker Patient Safety Culture: A Prospective Controlled Study
795,0,Patient safety culture is an integral aspect of good standard of care. 
796,0,A good patient safety culture is believed to be a prerequisite for safe medical care. 
797,0,"However, there is little evidence on whether general education can enhance patient safety culture."
798,1,Health care workers from Intensive Care Units (ICU) at two hospitals (A and B) in Hong Kong were recruited to compare the changes in safety culture before and after a patient safety course. 
799,1,The BASIC Patient Safety course was administered only to staff from Hospital A ICU. 
800,1,"Safety culture was assessed in both units at two time points, one before and one after the course, by using the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture questionnaire. "
801,1,"Responses were coded according to the Survey User's Guide, and positive response percentages for each patient safety domain were compared to the 2012 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ICU sample of 36,120 respondents."
802,2,We distributed 127 questionnaires across the two hospitals with an overall response rate of 74.8% (95 respondents). 
803,2,"After the safety course, ICU A significantly improved on teamwork within hospital units (P=.008) and hospital management support for patient safety (P<.001), but decreased in the frequency of reporting mistakes compared to the initial survey (P=.006). "
804,2,"Overall, ICU A staff showed significantly greater enhancement in positive responses in five domains than staff from ICU B. "
805,2,"Pooled data indicated that patient safety culture was poorer in the two ICUs than the average ICU in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality database, both overall and in every individual domain except hospital management support for patient safety and hospital handoffs and transitions."
806,3,"Our study demonstrates that a structured, reproducible short course on patient safety may be associated with an enhancement in several domains in ICU patient safety culture."
807,4,Feasibility and Limitations of Vaccine Two-Dimensional Barcoding Using Mobile Devices
808,0,Two-dimensional (2D) barcoding has the potential to enhance documentation of vaccine encounters at the point of care. 
809,0,"However, this is currently limited to environments equipped with dedicated barcode scanners and compatible record systems. "
810,0,Mobile devices may present a cost-effective alternative to leverage 2D vaccine vial barcodes and improve vaccine product-specific information residing in digital health records.
811,1,A unique barcode scanning app was developed for Android and iOS operating systems. 
812,1,"The impact of 4 variables on the scan success rate, data accuracy, and time to scan were examined: barcode size, curvature, fading, and ambient lighting conditions. "
813,1,"Two experimenters performed 4 trials 10 times each, amounting to a total of 2160 barcode scan attempts."
814,2,"Of the 1832 successful scans performed in this evaluation, zero produced incorrect data. "
815,2,"Five-millimeter barcodes were the slowest to scan, although only by 0.5 seconds on average. "
816,2,"Barcodes with up to 50% fading had a 100% success rate, but success rate deteriorated beyond 60% fading. "
817,2,"Curved barcodes took longer to scan compared with flat, but success rate deterioration was only observed at a vial diameter of 10 mm. "
818,2,Light conditions did not affect success rate or scan time between 500 lux and 20 lux. 
819,2,Conditions below 20 lux impeded the device's ability to scan successfully. 
820,2,Variability in scan time was observed across devices in all trials performed.
821,3,2D vaccine barcoding is possible using mobile devices and is successful under the majority of conditions examined. 
822,3,Manufacturers utilizing 2D barcodes should take into consideration the impact of factors that limit scan success rates. 
823,3,Future studies should evaluate the effect of mobile barcoding on workflow and vaccine administrator acceptance.
824,4,Evaluation Methods for Assessing Users Psychological Experiences of Web-Based Psychosocial Interventions: A Systematic Review
825,0,The use of Web-based interventions to deliver mental health and behavior change programs is increasingly popular. 
826,0,"They are cost-effective, accessible, and generally effective. "
827,0,"Often these interventions concern psychologically sensitive and challenging issues, such as depression or anxiety. "
828,0,The process by which a person receives and experiences therapy is important to understanding therapeutic process and outcomes. 
829,0,"While the experience of the patient or client in traditional face-to-face therapy has been evaluated in a number of ways, there appeared to be a gap in the evaluation of patient experiences of therapeutic interventions delivered online. "
830,0,Evaluation of Web-based artifacts has focused either on evaluation of experience from a computer Web-design perspective through usability testing or on evaluation of treatment effectiveness. 
831,0,Neither of these methods focuses on the psychological experience of the person while engaged in the therapeutic process.
832,1,A systematic literature review was undertaken of interdisciplinary databases with a focus on health and computer sciences. 
833,1,Studies that met a predetermined search protocol were included.
834,2,"Among 21 studies identified that examined psychological experience of the user, only 1 study collected user experience in situ. "
835,2,The most common method of understanding users' experience was through semistructured interviews conducted posttreatment or questionnaires administrated at the end of an intervention session. 
836,2,The questionnaires were usually based on standardized tools used to assess user experience with traditional face-to-face treatment.
837,3,There is a lack of methods specified in the literature to evaluate the interface between Web-based mental health or behavior change artifacts and users. 
838,3,Main limitations in the research were the nascency of the topic and cross-disciplinary nature of the field. 
839,3,There is a need to develop and deliver methods of understanding users' psychological experiences while using an intervention.
840,4,Less Than A Wife: A Study of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Content in Teen and Womens Digital Magazines
841,0,Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a major public health problem that affects women's physical and mental health. 
842,0,"According to the US National Institutes of Health Office of Disease Prevention, there is a need to improve public awareness of the syndrome among health care providers and the public. "
843,0,"Women's magazines are a type of ""edutainment"" that publish health content in addition to beauty, fashion, and entertainment content. "
844,0,These media have the potential to expose primarily female readers to content on PCOS and influence readers' beliefs and attitudes about women with PCOS.
845,1,"We used data from the Alliance for Audited Media to identify popular digital teen and women's magazines with circulation rates >= 1,000,001. "
846,1,"We also included magazines with circulation rates 100,001-1,000,000 directed toward racial and ethnic minority readers. "
847,1,"A search of magazine websites over a 1-month period in 2015 yielded 21 magazines (eg, Glamour, Cosmopolitan en Espanol, Essence, and O, The Oprah Magazine) and 170 articles containing ""PCOS"" and ""polycystic ovary syndrome."" Textual analysis using a grounded theory approach was used to identify themes."
848,2,Articles depicted PCOS symptoms as a hindrance to women's social roles as wives and mothers and largely placed personal responsibility on women to improve their health. 
849,2,"To a lesser extent, women were depicted as using their personal experience with PCOS to advocate for women's health. "
850,2,Experiences of Latina and African American women and adolescents with PCOS were absent from women's magazine articles.
851,3,The findings can inform health education programs that teach women to be critical consumers of PCOS-related content in digital women's magazines. 
852,3,"Future research on PCOS content in digital teen and women's magazines can help researchers, patients, and consumer groups engage with the media to increase public awareness of PCOS."
853,1,"PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched for relevant publications, and the last search was done in September 2015. "
854,1,"Three concepts were used to find publications: (1) mental health, (2) mobile phones, and (3) interventions. "
855,1,"A total of 33 studies (using either a within-or between-subject design) including 43 samples that received an EMI were identified (n=1301), and relevant study characteristics were coded using a standardized form. "
856,1,Quality assessment was done with the Cochrane Collaboration tool.
857,2,"Most of the EMIs focused on a clinical sample, used an active intervention (that offered exercises), and in over half of the studies, additional support by a mental health professional (MHP) was given. "
858,2,"The EMI lasted on average 7.48 weeks (SD=6.46), with 2.80 training episodes per day (SD=2.12) and 108.25 total training episodes (SD=123.00). "
859,2,"Overall, 27 studies were included in the meta-analysis, and after removing 6 outliers, a medium effect was found on mental health in the within-subject analyses (n=1008), with g=0.57 and 95% CI (0.45-0.70). "
860,2,"This effect did not differ as function of outcome type (ie, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, acceptance, relaxation, and quality of life). "
861,2,"The only moderator for which the effect varied significantly was additional support by an MHP (MHP-supported EMI, g=0.73, 95% CI: 0.57-0.88; stand-alone EMI, g=0.45, 95% CI: 0.22-0.69; stand-alone EMI with access to care as usual, g=0.38, 95% CI: 0.11-0.64). "
862,2,"In the between-subject studies, 13 studies were included, and a small to medium effect was found (g=0.40, 95% CI: 0.22-0.57). "
863,2,"Yet, these between-subject analyses were at risk for publication bias and were not suited for moderator analyses. "
864,2,"Furthermore, the overall quality of the studies was relatively low."
865,3,Results showed that there was a small to medium effect of EMIs on mental health and positive psychological well-being and that the effect was not different between outcome types. 
866,3,"Moreover, the effect was larger with additional support by an MHP. "
867,3,Future randomized controlled trials are needed to further strengthen the results and to determine potential moderator variables. 
868,3,"Overall, EMIs offer great potential for providing easy and cost-effective interventions to improve mental health and increase positive psychological well-being."
869,4,Devices for Self-Monitoring Sedentary Time or Physical Activity: A Scoping Review
870,0,It is well documented that meeting the guideline levels (150 minutes per week) of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (PA) is protective against chronic disease. 
871,0,"Conversely, emerging evidence indicates the deleterious effects of prolonged sitting. "
872,0,"Therefore, there is a need to change both behaviors. "
873,0,Self-monitoring of behavior is one of the most robust behavior-change techniques available. 
874,0,The growing number of technologies in the consumer electronics sector provides a unique opportunity for individuals to self-monitor their behavior.
875,1,"To identify technologies, four scientific databases were systematically searched using key terms related to behavior, measurement, and population. "
876,1,Articles published through October 2015 were identified. 
877,1,"To identify technologies from the consumer electronic sector, systematic searches of three Internet search engines were also performed through to October 1, 2015."
878,2,The initial database searches identified 46 devices and the Internet search engines identified 100 devices yielding a total of 146 technologies. 
879,2,"Of these, 64 were further removed because they were currently unavailable for purchase or there was no evidence that they were designed for, had been used in, or could readily be modified for self-monitoring purposes. "
880,2,"The remaining 82 technologies were included in this review (73 devices self-monitored PA, 9 devices self-monitored sedentary time). "
881,2,"Of the 82 devices included, this review identified no published articles in which these devices were used for the purpose of self-monitoring PA and/or sedentary behavior; however, a number of technologies were found via Internet searches that matched the criteria for self-monitoring and provided immediate feedback on PA (ActiGraph Link, Microsoft Band, and Garmin Vivofit) and sedentary time (activPAL VT, the Lumo Back, and Darma)."
882,3,"There are a large number of devices that self-monitor PA; however, there is a greater need for the development of tools to self-monitor sedentary time. "
883,3,"The novelty of these devices means they have yet to be used in behavior change interventions, although the growing field of wearable technology may facilitate this to change."
884,4,Awareness and Use of the After-Visit Summary Through a Patient Portal: Evaluation of Patient Characteristics and an Application of the Theory of Planned Behavior
885,0,Patient portals are being used to provide a clinical summary of the office visit or the after-visit summary (AVS) to patients. 
886,0,There has been relatively little research on the characteristics of patients who access the AVS through a patient portal and their beliefs about the AVS.
887,1,"We developed a survey capturing the components of TPB (beliefs, attitude, perceived norm, and perceived behavioral control). "
888,1,"Over a 6-month period, patients with a patient portal account with an office visit in the previous week were identified using our organization's scheduling system. "
889,1,These patients were sent an email about the study and a link to the survey via their portal account. 
890,1,We applied univariate statistical analysis (Pearson chi-square and 1-way ANOVA) to assess differences among groups (aware/unaware of AVS and accessed/did not access AVS). 
891,1,"We reported means and standard deviations to depict belief strengths and presented correlations between beliefs and attitude, perceived norm, and perceived behavioral control. "
892,1,We used hierarchical regression analysis to predict behavioral intention toward accessing the AVS through the patient portal.
893,2,"Of the 23,336 patients who were sent the survey, 5370 responded for a response rate of 23.01%. "
894,2,"Overall, 76.52% (4109/5370) were aware that the AVS was available through the patient portal and 54.71% of those (2248/4109) accessed the AVS within 5 days of the office visit. "
895,2,"Patients who accessed the AVS had a greater number of sessions with the portal (mean 119, SD 221.5) than those who did not access the AVS (mean 79.1, SD 123.3, P<.001); the difference was not significant for awareness of the AVS. "
896,2,"The strongest behavioral beliefs with accessing the AVS were being able to track visits and tests (mean 2.53, SD 1.00) followed by having medical information more readily accessible (mean 2.48, SD 1.07). "
897,2,"In all, 56.7% of the variance in intention to access the AVS through the portal was accounted for by attitude, perceived norm, and perceived behavioral control."
898,3,Most users of a patient portal were aware that the AVS was accessible through the portal. 
899,3,Patients had stronger beliefs about accessing the AVS with the goal of timely and efficient access of information than with engaging in their health care. 
900,3,"Interventions to improve patient access of the AVS can focus on providers promoting patient beliefs about the value of the AVS for tracking tests and visits, and timely and efficient access of information."
901,4,Patterns of Treatment Switching in Multiple Sclerosis Therapies in US Patients Active on Social Media: Application of Social Media Content Analysis to Health Outcomes Research
902,0,Social media analysis has rarely been applied to the study of specific questions in outcomes research.
903,1,A comprehensive listening and analysis process was developed that blended automated listening with filtering and analysis of data by life sciences-qualified analysts and physicians. 
904,1,The population was patients with MS from the United States. 
905,1,"Data sources were Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and online forums. "
906,1,"Sources were searched for mention of specific oral, injectable, and intravenous (IV) infusion treatments. "
907,1,"The representativeness of the social media population was validated by comparison with community survey data and with data from three large US administrative claims databases: MarketScan, PharMetrics Plus, and Department of Defense."
908,2,"A total of 10,260 data points were sampled for manual review: 3025 from Twitter, 3771 from Facebook, 2773 from Internet forums, and 691 from blogs. "
909,2,The demographics of the social media population were similar to those reported from community surveys and claims databases. 
910,2,Mean age was 39 (SD 11) years and 14.56% (326/2239) of the population was older than 50 years. 
911,2,"Women, patients aged 30 to 49 years, and those diagnosed for more than 10 years were represented by more data points than other patients were. "
912,2,"Women also accounted for a large majority (82.6%, 819/991) of reported switches. "
913,2,Two-fifths of switching patients had lived with their disease for more than 10 years since diagnosis. 
914,2,"Most reported switches (55.05%, 927/1684) were from injectable to oral drugs with switches from IV therapies to orals the second largest switch (15.38%, 259/1684). "
915,2,Switches to oral drugs accounted for more than 80% (927/1114) of the switches away from injectable therapies. 
916,2,"Four reasons accounted for more than 90% of all switches: severe side effects, lack of efficacy, physicians' advice, and greater ease of use. "
917,2,Side effects were the main reason for switches to oral or to injectable therapies and search for greater efficacy was the most important factor in switches to IV therapies. 
918,2,Cost of medication was the reason for switching in less than 0.5% of patients.
919,3,Social intelligence can be applied to outcomes research with power to analyze MS patients' personal experiences of treatments and to chart the most common reasons for switching between therapies.
920,4,Impact of a Mobile Phone Intervention to Reduce Sedentary Behavior in a Community Sample of Adults: A Quasi-Experimental Evaluation
921,0,"Greater time spent sedentary is linked with increased risk of breast, colorectal, ovarian, endometrial, and prostate cancers. "
922,0,"Given steadily increasing rates of mobile phone ownership, mobile phone interventions may have the potential to broadly influence sedentary behavior across settings."
923,1,Adults participated in a quasi-experimental evaluation of a mobile phone intervention designed to reduce sedentary time through prompts to interrupt periods of sitting. 
924,1,Participants carried mobile phones and wore accelerometers for 7 consecutive days. 
925,1,Intervention participants additionally received mobile phone prompts during self-reported sitting and information about the negative health impact of prolonged sedentariness. 
926,1,"The study was conducted from December 2012 to November 2013 in Dallas, Texas. "
927,1,Linear mixed model regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of the intervention on daily accelerometer-determined estimates of sedentary and active time.
928,2,"Participants (N=215) were predominantly female (67.9%, 146/215) and nonwhite (black: 50.7%, 109/215; Latino: 12.1%, 26/215; other: 5.6%, 12/215). "
929,2,"Analyses revealed that participants who received the mobile phone intervention had significantly fewer daily minutes of sedentary time (B=-22.09, P=.045) and more daily active minutes (B=23.01, P=.04) than control participants."
930,3,A simple mobile phone intervention was associated with engaging in less sedentary time and more physical activity. 
931,3,Findings underscore the potential impact of mobile phone interventions to positively influence sedentary behavior and physical activity.
932,4,Why Didnt it Work? Lessons From a Randomized Controlled Trial of a Web-based Personally Controlled Health Management System for Adults with Asthma
933,0,"Personally controlled health management systems (PCHMS), which may include a personal health record (PHR), health management tools, and information resources, have been advocated as a next-generation technology to improve health behaviors and outcomes. "
934,0,There have been successful trials of PCHMS in various health settings. 
935,0,"However, there is mixed evidence for whether consumers will use these systems over the long term and whether they ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and behaviors."
936,1,A 12-month parallel 2-group randomized controlled trial was conducted. 
937,1,"Participants living with asthma were recruited nationally in Australia between April and August 2013, and randomized 1: 1 to either the PCHMS group or control group (online static educational content). "
938,1,The primary outcome measure was possession of an up-to-date written AAP poststudy. 
939,1,"Secondary measures included (1) utilizing the AAP; (2) planned or unplanned visits to a health care professional for asthma-related concerns; (3) severe asthma exacerbation, inadequately controlled asthma, or worsening of asthma that required a change in treatment; and (4) number of days lost from work or study due to asthma. "
940,1,Ancillary analyses examined reasons for adoption or nonadoption of the intervention. 
941,1,"Outcome measures were collected by online questionnaire prestudy, monthly, and poststudy."
942,2,A total of 330 eligible participants were randomized into 1 of 2 arms (intervention: n=154; control: n=176). 
943,2,Access to the PCHMS was not associated with a significant difference in any of the primary or secondary outcomes. 
944,2,"Most participants (80.5%, 124/154) did not access the intervention or accessed it only once."
945,3,"Despite the intervention being effective in other preventive care settings, system use was negligible and outcome changes were not seen as a result. "
946,3,Consumers must perceive the need for assistance with a task and assign priority to the task supported by the eHealth intervention. 
947,3,"Additionally, the cost of adopting the intervention (eg, additional effort, time spent learning the new system) must be lower than the benefit. "
948,3,"Otherwise, there is high risk consumers will not adopt the eHealth intervention."
949,4,"Diabetes Prevention and Weight Loss with a Fully Automated Behavioral Intervention by Email, Web, and Mobile Phone: A Randomized Controlled Trial Among Persons with Prediabetes"
950,0,"One-third of US adults, 86 million people, have prediabetes. "
951,0,Two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese and at risk for diabetes. 
952,0,"Effective and affordable interventions are needed that can reach these 86 million, and others at high risk, to reduce their progression to diagnosed diabetes."
953,1,"Alive-PD provided tailored behavioral support for improvements in physical activity, eating habits, and factors such as weight loss, stress, and sleep. "
954,1,"Weekly emails suggested small-step goals and linked to an individual Web page with tools for tracking, coaching, social support through virtual teams, competition, and health information. "
955,1,A mobile phone app and automated phone calls provided further support. 
956,1,The trial randomly assigned 339 persons to the Alive-PD intervention (n=163) or a 6-month wait-list usual-care control group (n=176). 
957,1,Participants were eligible if either fasting glucose or glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was in the prediabetic range. 
958,1,Primary outcome measures were changes in fasting glucose and HbA1c at 6 months. 
959,1,"Secondary outcome measures included clinic-measured changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL) ratio, and Framingham diabetes risk score. "
960,1,Analysis was by intention-to-treat.
961,2,"Participants' mean age was 55 (SD 8.9) years, mean BMI was 31.2 (SD 4.4) kg/m(2), and 68.7% (233/339) were male. "
962,2,"Mean fasting glucose was in the prediabetic range (mean 109.9, SD 8.4 mg/dL), whereas the mean HbA1c was 5.6% (SD 0.3), in the normal range. "
963,2,"In intention-to-treat analyses, Alive-PD participants achieved significantly greater reductions than controls in fasting glucose (mean -7.36 mg/dL, 95% CI -7.85 to -6.87 vs mean -2.19, 95% CI -2.64 to -1.73, P<.001), HbA1c (mean -0.26%, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.24 vs mean -0.18%, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.16, P<.001), and body weight (mean -3.26 kg, 95% CI -3.26 to -3.25 vs mean -1.26 kg, 95% CI -1.27 to -1.26, P<.001). "
964,2,"Reductions in BMI, waist circumference, and TG/HDL were also significantly greater in Alive-PD participants than in the control group. "
965,2,"At 6 months, the Alive-PD group reduced their Framingham 8-year diabetes risk from 16% to 11%, significantly more than the control group (P<.001). "
966,2,Participation and retention was good; intervention participants interacted with the program a median of 17 (IQR 14) of 24 weeks and 71.1% (116/163) were still interacting with the program in month 6.
967,3,"Alive-PD improved glycemic control, body weight, BMI, waist circumference, TG/HDL ratio, and diabetes risk. "
968,3,"As a fully automated system, the program has high potential for scalability and could potentially reach many of the 86 million US adults who have prediabetes as well as other at-risk groups."
969,4,Evaluating the Validity of an Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring for Adolescents: Correlational Design
970,0,Symptom monitoring is a cornerstone of asthma self-management. 
971,0,"Conventional methods of symptom monitoring have fallen short in producing objective data and eliciting patients' consistent adherence, particularly in teen patients. "
972,0,We have recently developed an Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring (ADAM) using a consumer mobile device as a platform to facilitate continuous and objective symptom monitoring in adolescents in vivo.
973,1,A total of 84 teens (42 teens with a current asthma diagnosis; 42 without asthma) aged between 13 and 17 years participated in the study. 
974,1,All participants used ADAM for 7 consecutive days during which participants with asthma completed an asthma diary two times a day. 
975,1,ADAM recorded the frequency of coughing for 24 hours throughout the 7-day trial. 
976,1,"Pearson correlation and multiple regression were used to examine the relationships between ADAM data and asthma control, quality of life, and health care utilization at the time of the 7-day trial and 3 months later. "
977,1,A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to examine sensitivity and specificity based on the area under the curve (AUC) as an indicator of the device's capacity to discriminate between asthma versus nonasthma cases.
978,2,"ADAM data (cough counts) were negatively associated with forced expiratory volume in first second of expiration (FEV1) (r=-.26, P=.05), forced vital capacity (FVC) (r=-.31, P=.02), and overall asthma control (r=-.41, P=.009) and positively associated with daily activity limitation (r=.46, P=.01), nighttime (r=.40, P=.02) and daytime symptoms (r=.38, P=.02), and health care utilization (r=.61, P<.001). "
979,2,"Device data were also a significant predictor of asthma control (beta=-.48, P=.003), quality of life (beta=-.55, P=.001), and health care utilization (beta=.74, P=.004) after 3 months. "
980,2,"The ROC curve analysis for the presence of asthma diagnosis had an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.58-0.84), which was significantly different from chance (chi(2)(1)=9.7, P=.002), indicating the device's discriminating capacity. "
981,2,The optimal cutoff value of the device was 0.56 with a sensitivity of 51.3% and a specificity of 72.7%.
982,3,This study demonstrates validity of ADAM as a symptom-monitoring device in teens with asthma. 
983,3,ADAM data reflect the current status of asthma control and predict asthma morbidity and quality of life for the near future. 
984,3,A monitoring device such as ADAM can increase patients' awareness of the patterns of cough for early detection of worsening asthma and has the potential for preventing serious and costly future consequences of asthma.
985,4,A Web-Based Self-Help Intervention With and Without Chat Counseling to Reduce Cannabis Use in Problematic Cannabis Users: Three-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial
986,0,"After alcohol and tobacco, cannabis is the most widely used psychoactive substance in many countries worldwide. "
987,0,"Although approximately one in ten users develops serious problems of dependency, only a minority attend outpatient addiction counseling centers. "
988,0,A Web-based intervention could potentially reach those users who hesitate to approach such treatment centers.
989,1,"Altogether, 436 participants were recruited by various online and offline media for the Web-based trial. "
990,1,"A total of 308 of these were eligible for study participation and were randomly allocated in an unblinded manner to either self-help with chat (n=114), self-help without chat (n=101), or a waiting list control group (n=93). "
991,1,"The fully automated self-help intervention consisted of eight modules designed to reduce cannabis use, and was based on the principles of motivational interviewing, self-control practices, and methods of cognitive behavioral therapy. "
992,1,Additional individual chat counseling sessions were based on the same therapeutic principles. 
993,1,The sessions were conducted by trained counselors and addressed participants' personal problems. 
994,1,"The main outcomes were the frequency (number of days) and quantity of cannabis use (number of standardized joints) per week, as entered into the consumption diary at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up. "
995,1,"Secondary outcomes included self-reported symptoms of cannabis use disorder, severity of cannabis dependence, risky alcohol use, and mental health symptoms. "
996,1,"Intervention participation and retention were extracted from the user progress data and the consumption diary, respectively."
997,2,"Can Reduce participants were older (U=2.296, P=.02) and reported a greater number of cannabis use days at baseline than patients who entered outpatient treatment with cannabis as their main problem substance (data from the Swiss treatment demand monitoring statistics were used; chi-square [df2]=4.0, P=.046). "
998,2,Participants in the self-help with chat study arm completed a mean of 3.2 modules and 27 out of 114 (23.7%) of the participants received at least one chat session. 
999,2,Participants in the self-help without chat study arm completed similar numbers of self-help modules. 
1000,2,A total of 117 of 308 participants (38.0%) completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. 
1001,2,"The change in the mean number of cannabis use days per week at 3 months differed between self-help without chat (mean change 0.7, SD -0.2) and self-help with chat (mean change 1.4, SD -0.5; beta=-0.75, SE=0.32, t=-2.39, P=.02, d=0.34, 95% CI 0.07-0.61), as well as between self-help with chat and waiting list (mean change 1.0, SD -0.8; beta=0.70, SE=0.32, t=2.16, P=.03, d=0.20, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.47). "
1002,2,"However, there were no differences between self-help without chat and waiting list (beta=-0.05, SE=0.33, t=-0.16, P=.87, d=-0.14, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.14). "
1003,2,"Self-reported abstinence was significantly different in the self-help without chat study arm (2.0%) than in the self-help with chat study arm (8.8%; beta=-1.56, SE=0.79, P=.05, odds ratio [OR]-0.21, 95% CI 0.02-2.33). "
1004,2,There were no significant differences between the study arms with respect to the secondary outcomes.
1005,3,Web-based self-help interventions supplemented by brief chat counseling are an effective alternative to face-to-face treatment and can reach a group of cannabis users who differ in their use and sociodemographic characteristics from those who enter outpatient addiction treatment.
1006,4,Assessment of Web-Based Consumer Reviews as a Resource for Drug Performance
1007,0,Some health websites provide a public forum for consumers to post ratings and reviews on drugs. 
1008,0,"Drug reviews are easily accessible and comprehensible, unlike clinical trials and published literature. "
1009,0,"Because the public increasingly uses the Internet as a source of medical information, it is important to know whether such information is reliable."
1010,1,"We analyzed 103,411 consumer-generated reviews on 615 drugs used to treat 249 disease conditions from the health website WebMD. "
1011,1,Statistical analysis identified 427 drug pairs from 24 conditions for which two drugs treating the same condition had significantly and substantially different satisfaction ratings (with at least a half-point difference between Web-based ratings and P<.01). 
1012,1,PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for publications that were assessed for concordance with findings online.
1013,2,Scientific literature was found for 77 out of the 427 drug pairs and compared to findings online. 
1014,2,"Nearly two-thirds (48/77, 62%) of the online drug trends with at least a half-point difference in online ratings were supported by published literature (P=.02). "
1015,2,"For a 1-point online rating difference, the concordance rate increased to 68% (15/22) (P=.07). "
1016,2,The discrepancies between scientific literature and findings online were further examined to obtain more insights into the usability of Web-based consumer-generated reviews. 
1017,2,"We discovered that (1) drugs with FDA black box warnings or used off-label were rated poorly in Web-based reviews, (2) drugs with addictive properties were rated higher than their counterparts in Web-based reviews, and (3) second-line or alternative drugs were rated higher. "
1018,2,"In addition, Web-based ratings indicated drug delivery problems. "
1019,2,"If FDA black box warning labels are used to resolve disagreements between publications and online trends, the concordance rate increases to 71% (55/77) (P<.001) for a half-point rating difference and 82% (18/22) for a 1-point rating difference (P=.002). "
1020,2,"Our results suggest that Web-based reviews can be used to inform patients' drug choices, with certain caveats."
1021,3,"Web-based reviews can be viewed as an orthogonal source of information for consumers, physicians, and drug manufacturers to assess the performance of a drug. "
1022,3,"However, one should be cautious to rely solely on consumer reviews as ratings can be strongly influenced by the consumer experience."
1023,4,Predictors of Liking Three Types of Health and Fitness-Related Content on Social Media: A Cross-Sectional Study
1024,0,"Adolescence and young adulthood are key periods for developing norms related to health behaviors and body image, and social media can influence these norms. "
1025,0,"Social media is saturated with content related to dieting, fitness, and health. "
1026,0,Health and fitness-related social media content has received significant media attention for often containing objectifying and inaccurate health messages. 
1027,0,"Limited research has identified problematic features of such content, including stigmatizing language around weight, portraying guilt-related messages regarding food, and praising thinness. "
1028,0,"However, no research has identified who is ""liking"" or ""following"" (ie, consuming) such content."
1029,1,"Participants (N=1001; age: median 21.06, IQR 17.64-24.64; female: 723/1001, 72.23%) completed a cross-sectional 112-question online survey aimed at social media users aged between 15-29 years residing in Victoria, Australia. "
1030,1,Logistic regression was used to determine which characteristics predicted consuming the 3 types of health and fitness-related social media content.
1031,2,"A total of 378 (37.76%) participants reported consuming at least 1 of the 3 types of health and fitness-related social media content: 308 (30.77%) fitspiration pages, 145 (14.49%) detox pages, and 235 (23.48%) diet/fitness plan pages. "
1032,2,"Of the health and fitness-related social media content consumers, 85.7% (324/378) identified as female and 44.8% (324/723) of all female participants consumed at least 1 type of health and fitness-related social media content. "
1033,2,"Predictors of consuming at least one type of health and fitness-related social media content in univariable analysis included female gender (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.5-4.9, P<.001), being aged 15-17 years (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.2-4.0, P<.001), residing outside a major city (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.9,P<.001), having no post-high school education (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-2.9, P<.001), being born in Australia (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.2, P=.006), having a self-reported eating disorder (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.9, P<.001), being a victim of bullying (OR 1.7, CI 1.3-2.3, P<.001), misusing detox/laxative teas or diet pills (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.8-7.6, P<.001), never using illegal drugs (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.0, P=.001), and not engaging in risky single occasion drinking on a weekly basis (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0, P=.003)."
1034,3,Consumers of health and fitness-related social media content were predominantly teenaged girls. 
1035,3,"There is a need to ensure that this social media content portrays responsible health messages and to research further the role of fitspiration pages, detox pages, and diet/fitness plan pages in influencing body image and health behaviors."
1036,4,Using Information and Communication Technologies for Family Communication and Its Association With Family Well-Being in Hong Kong: FAMILY Project
1037,0,Family communication is central to the family and its functioning. 
1038,0,"It is a mutual process in which family members create, share, and regulate meaning. "
1039,0,Advancement and proliferation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) continues to change methods of family communication. 
1040,0,"However, little is known about the use of different methods for family communication and the influence on family well-being."
1041,1,Data came from a territory-wide probability-based telephone survey using the Family and Health Information Trend survey (FHInTs). 
1042,1,"Frequency of family communication using different methods (ie, face-to-face, phone, instant messaging [ IM], social media sites, and email) were recoded and classified as frequent (always/sometimes) and nonfrequent (seldom/never) use. "
1043,1,"Family well-being was measured using 3 questions of perceived family harmony, happiness, and health with higher scores indicating better family well-being. "
1044,1,Adjusted odds ratios for family communication methods by sociodemographic characteristics and adjusted beta coefficients for family well-being by communication methods were calculated.
1045,2,A total of 1502 adults were surveyed. 
1046,2,"Face-to-face (94.85%, 1408/1484) was the most frequent means of communication followed by phone (78.08%, 796/1484), IM (53.64%, 796/1484), social media sites (17.60%, 261/1484), and email (13.39%, 198/1484). "
1047,2,"Younger age was associated with the use of phone, IM, and social media sites for family communication. "
1048,2,"Higher educational attainment was associated with more frequent use of all modes of communication, whereas higher family income was only significantly associated with more frequent use of IM and email (P=.001). "
1049,2,"Face-to-face (beta 0.65, 95% CI 0.33-0.97) and phone use (beta 0.20, 95% CI 0.02-0.38) for family communication were associated with significantly higher levels of perceived family well-being."
1050,3,Socioeconomic disparities in using these information and communication technologies (ICT) methods for family communication were observed. 
1051,3,"Although traditional methods remain as the main platform for family communication and were associated with better family well-being, a notable proportion of respondents are using new ICT methods, which were not associated with perceived family well-being. "
1052,3,"Because ICTs will continue to diversify modes of family communication, more research is needed to understand the impact of ICTs on family communication and well-being."
1053,4,Information and Communication Technology Use Among Low-Income Pregnant and Postpartum Women by Race and Ethnicity: A Cross-Sectional Study
1054,0,"Pregnancy and the postpartum period provide windows of opportunity to impact perinatal and lifelong preventive health behavior for women and their families, but these opportunities are often missed. "
1055,0,Understanding racial/ethnic differences in information and communication technology (ICT) use could inform technology-based interventions in diverse populations.
1056,1,We conducted a cross-sectional study of 246 women who were aged 18 years or older and pregnant or within 1 year of delivery. 
1057,1,They were recruited from 4 hospital-based outpatient clinics and completed a self-administered survey. 
1058,1,"We used multivariate regression analysis to evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and ICT (mobile phone/short message service [SMS] text message, Internet, and social network) usage by race/ethnicity and perceived English language proficiency after adjusting for age, income, marital status, and insurance status."
1059,2,"In all, 28% (69/246) of participants were Latina, 40% (98/246) were African American, 23% (56/246) were white, and 9% (23/246) from other racial/ethnic groups. "
1060,2,"Of the Latinas, 84% (58/69) reported limited English language proficiency and 59% (41/69) were uninsured. "
1061,2,"More than 90% of all participants reported mobile phone use, but more than 25% (65/246) had changed phone numbers 2 or more times in the past year. "
1062,2,"Compared to white women, African American women were less likely to SMS text message (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.63) and Latinas were less likely to use the Internet to find others with similar concerns (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.73). "
1063,2,"Women with limited English language proficiency were less likely to use the Internet overall (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09-0.99) or use email (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.63) compared to women with adequate English language proficiency."
1064,3,"Mobile phones are widely available for the delivery of health interventions to low-income, racially diverse pregnant and postpartum women, but disparities in Internet use and SMS text messaging exist. "
1065,3,"Interventions or programs requiring Web-based apps may have lower uptake unless alternatives are available, such as those adapted for limited English proficiency populations."
1066,4,Online Recruitment Methods for Web-Based and Mobile Health Studies: A Review of the Literature
1067,0,Internet and mobile health (mHealth) apps hold promise for expanding the reach of evidence-based health interventions. 
1068,0,Research in this area is rapidly expanding. 
1069,0,"However, these studies may experience problems with recruitment and retention. "
1070,0,Web-based and mHealth studies are in need of a wide-reaching and low-cost method of recruitment that will also effectively retain participants for the duration of the study. 
1071,0,"Online recruitment may be a low-cost and wide-reaching tool in comparison to traditional recruitment methods, although empirical evidence is limited."
1072,1,We conducted a review of the literature of studies examining online recruitment methods as a viable means of obtaining mHealth research participants. 
1073,1,"The data sources used were PubMed, CINAHL, EbscoHost, PyscINFO, and MEDLINE. "
1074,1,Studies reporting at least one method of online recruitment were included. 
1075,1,"A narrative approach enabled the authors to discuss the variability in recruitment results, as well as in recruitment duration and study design."
1076,2,"From 550 initial publications, 12 studies were included in this review. "
1077,2,The studies reported multiple uses and outcomes for online recruitment methods. 
1078,2,Web-based recruitment was the only type of recruitment used in 67% (8/12) of the studies. 
1079,2,Online recruitment was used for studies with a variety of health domains: smoking cessation (58%; 7/12) and mental health (17%; 2/12) being the most common. 
1080,2,"Recruitment duration lasted under a year in 67% (8/12) of the studies, with an average of 5 months spent on recruiting. "
1081,2,"In those studies that spent over a year (33%; 4/12), an average of 17 months was spent on recruiting. "
1082,2,"A little less than half (42%; 5/12) of the studies found Facebook ads or newsfeed posts to be an effective method of recruitment, a quarter (25%; 3/12) of the studies found Google ads to be the most effective way to reach participants, and one study showed better outcomes with traditional (eg in-person) methods of recruitment. "
1083,2,"Only one study recorded retention rates in their results, and half (50%; 6/12) of the studies recorded survey completion rates."
1084,3,"Although online methods of recruitment may be promising in experimental research, more empirical evidence is needed to make specific recommendations. "
1085,3,"Several barriers to using online recruitment were identified, including participant retention. "
1086,3,These unique challenges of virtual interventions can affect the generalizability and validity of findings from Web-based and mHealth studies. 
1087,3,There is a need for additional research to evaluate the effectiveness of online recruitment methods and participant retention in experimental mHealth studies.
1088,4,The Invisible Work of Personal Health Information Management Among People With Multiple Chronic Conditions: Qualitative Interview Study Among Patients and Providers
1089,0,"A critical problem for patients with chronic conditions who see multiple health care providers is incomplete or inaccurate information, which can contribute to lack of care coordination, low quality of care, and medical errors."
1090,1,Semistructured interviews were conducted with patients and providers. 
1091,1,Patients were eligible if they had multiple chronic conditions and were in regular care with one of two medical organizations in New York City; health care providers were eligible if they had experience caring for patients with multiple chronic conditions. 
1092,1,"Analysis was conducted from a grounded theory perspective, and recruitment was concluded when saturation was achieved."
1093,2,A total of 22 patients and 7 providers were interviewed; patients had an average of 3.5 (SD 1.5) chronic conditions and reported having regular relationships with an average of 5 providers. 
1094,2,"Four major themes arose: (1) Responsibility for managing medical information: some patients perceived information management and sharing as the responsibility of health care providers; others-particularly those who had had bad experiences in the past-took primary responsibility for information sharing; (2) What information should be shared: although privacy concerns did influence some patients' perceptions of sharing of medical data, decisions about what to share were also heavily influenced by their understanding of health and disease and by the degree to which they understood the health care system; (3) Methods and tools varied: those patients who did take an active role in managing their records used a variety of electronic tools, paper tools, and memory; and (4) Information management as invisible work: managing transfers of medical information to solve problems was a tremendous amount of work that was largely unrecognized by the medical establishment."
1095,3,We conclude that personal health information management should be recognized as an additional burden that MCC places upon patients. 
1096,3,"Effective structural solutions for information sharing, whether institutional ones such as care management or technological ones such as electronic health information exchange, are likely not only to improve the quality of information shared but reduce the burden on patients already weighed down by MCC."
1097,4,"Exposure to a Patient-Centered, Web-Based Intervention for Managing Cancer Symptom and Quality of Life Issues: Impact on Symptom Distress"
1098,0,Effective eHealth interventions can benefit a large number of patients with content intended to support self-care and management of both chronic and acute conditions. 
1099,0,"Even though usage statistics are easily logged in most eHealth interventions, usage or exposure has rarely been reported in trials, let alone studied in relationship to effectiveness."
1100,1,Patients at two cancer centers used ESRA-C to self-report symptom and quality of life (SxQOL) issues during therapy. 
1101,1,Participants were randomized to ESRA-C assessment only (control) or the ESRA-C intervention delivered via the Internet to patients' homes or to a tablet at the clinic. 
1102,1,The intervention enabled participants to self-monitor SxQOL and receive self-care education and customized coaching on how to report concerns to clinicians. 
1103,1,"Overall and voluntary intervention use were defined as having >= 2 exposures, and one non-prompted exposure to the intervention, respectively. "
1104,1,Factors associated with intervention use were explored with Fisher's exact test. 
1105,1,Propensity score matching was used to select a sample of control participants similar to intervention participants who used the intervention. 
1106,1,Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare change in Symptom Distress Scale (SDS-15) scores from pre-treatment to end-of-study by groups in the matched sample.
1107,2,"Radiation oncology participants used the intervention, overall and voluntarily, more than medical oncology and transplant participants. "
1108,2,Participants who were working and had more than a high school education voluntarily used the intervention more. 
1109,2,The SDS-15 score was reduced by an estimated 1.53 points (P=.01) in the intervention group users compared to the matched control group.
1110,3,"The intended effects of a Web-based, patient-centered intervention on cancer symptom distress were modified by intervention use frequency. "
1111,3,Clinical and personal demographics influenced voluntary use.
1112,4,Computerized Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Anxiety and Depression in Rural Areas: A Systematic Review
1113,0,"People living in rural and remote communities have greater difficulty accessing mental health services and evidence-based therapies, such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), than their urban counterparts. "
1114,0,Computerized CBT (CCBT) can be used to effectively treat depression and anxiety and may be particularly useful in rural settings where there are a lack of suitably trained practitioners.
1115,1,"We searched seven online databases: Medline, Embase Classic and Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. "
1116,1,"We also hand searched reference lists, Internet search engines, and trial protocols. "
1117,1,Two stages of selection were undertaken. 
1118,1,"In the first, the three authors screened citations. "
1119,1,"Studies were retained if they reported the efficacy, effectiveness or acceptability of CCBT for depression and/or anxiety disorders, were peer reviewed, and written in English. "
1120,1,"The qualitative data analysis software, NVivo 10, was then used to run automated text searches for the word ""rural,"" its synonyms, and stemmed words. "
1121,1,All studies identified were read in full and were included in the study if they measured or meaningfully discussed the efficacy or acceptability of CCBT among rural participants.
1122,2,"A total of 2594 studies were identified, of which 11 met the selection criteria and were included in the review. "
1123,2,The studies that disaggregated efficacy data by location of participant reported that CCBT was equally effective for rural and urban participants. 
1124,2,Rural location was found to both positively and negatively predict adherence across studies. 
1125,2,CCBT may be more acceptable among rural than urban participants-studies to date showed that rural participants were less likely to want more face-to-face contact with a practitioner and found that computerized delivery addressed confidentiality concerns.
1126,3,CCBT can be effective for addressing depression and anxiety and is acceptable among rural participants. 
1127,3,"Further work is required to confirm these results across a wider range of countries, and to determine the most feasible model of CCBT delivery, in partnership with people who live and work in rural and remote communities."
1128,4,Older People Going Online: Its Value and Before-After Evaluation of Volunteer Support
1129,0,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. "
1130,0,Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. 
1131,0,We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. 
1132,0,"Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline."
1133,1,"Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. "
1134,1,"We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). "
1135,1,We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey.
1136,2,A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. 
1137,2,Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. 
1138,2,"From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80- and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. "
1139,2,"Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. "
1140,2,"Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. "
1141,2,There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements.
1142,3,"Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. "
1143,3,"Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health. "
1144,3,"Contacting family is likely to be the best ""selling point"" of the Internet for older people."
1145,4,A Mixed-Methods Study on the Acceptability of Using eHealth for HIV Prevention and Sexual Health Care Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in China
1146,0,Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM). 
1147,0,Over half of all HIV-positive MSM in China may not know their HIV status. 
1148,0,"Mobile phones and Web interventions (eHealth) are underutilized resources that show promise for supporting HIV education, testing, and linkage to care."
1149,1,We conducted in-depth interviews and an online survey. 
1150,1,"Qualitative analyses informed the development of the Internet survey, which was administered through two popular MSM websites. "
1151,1,Bivariate and multivariate analysis assessed characteristics of MSM interested in eHealth for sexual health care.
1152,2,"The qualitative sample included MSM across a range of ages, education, marital status, sexuality, and HIV testing experience. "
1153,2,"Qualitative findings included the importance of the Internet as the primary source of information about sexual health, HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), use of the Internet to enable HIV testing opportunities by facilitating connections with both the gay community and health care providers, and mixed perceptions regarding the confidentiality of eHealth tools for sexual health. "
1154,2,"Among the Internet sample (N=1342), the average age was 30.6 years old, 82.81% (1098/1342) were single, and 53.42% (711/1331) had completed college. "
1155,2,"In the past 3 months, 38.66% (382/988) had condomless sex and 60.53% (805/1330) self-reported having ever tested for HIV. "
1156,2,"The majority of men owned computers (94.14%, 1220/1296) and mobile phones (92.32%, 1239/1342), which many had used to search for HIV/STD information and testing sites. "
1157,2,"In multivariate analysis, interest in using computers or mobile phones to support their sexual health care was associated with being a student, prior use of computers or mobile phones to search for general health information, prior use of computers or mobile phones to search for HIV/STD information, and confidentiality concerns."
1158,3,MSM in this sample had high utilization of technology and interest in eHealth despite confidentiality concerns. 
1159,3,Future eHealth interventions can thoughtfully and creatively address these concerns as a priority for successful implementation.
1160,4,"The Effect of Technology-Based Interventions on Pain, Depression, and Quality of Life in Patients With Cancer: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials"
1161,0,The burden of cancer is increasing; projections over the next 2 decades suggest that the annual cases of cancer will rise from 14 million in 2012 to 22 million. 
1162,0,"However, cancer patients in the 21st century are living longer due to the availability of novel therapeutic regimens, which has prompted a growing focus on maintaining patients' health-related quality of life. "
1163,0,"Telehealth is increasingly being used to connect with patients outside of traditional clinical settings, and early work has shown its importance in improving quality of life and other clinical outcomes in cancer care."
1164,1,"We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and PsycINFO in July 2013 and updated the literature search again in January 2015 for prospective randomized trials evaluating the effect of telehealth interventions in cancer care with pain, depression, and quality of life as main outcomes. "
1165,1,"Two of the authors independently reviewed and extracted data from eligible randomized controlled trials, based on pre-determined selection criteria. "
1166,1,Methodological quality of studies was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool.
1167,2,"Of the 4929 articles retrieved from databases and relevant bibliographies, a total of 20 RCTs were included in the final review. "
1168,2,The studies were largely heterogeneous in the type and duration of the intervention as well as in outcome assessments. 
1169,2,A majority of the studies were telephone-based interventions that remotely connected patients with their health care provider or health coach. 
1170,2,The intervention times ranged from 1 week to 12 months. 
1171,2,"In general, most of the studies had low risk of bias across the domains of the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool, but most of the studies had insufficient information about the allocation concealment domain. "
1172,2,"Two of the three studies focused on pain control reported significant effects of the intervention; four of the nine studies focus on depression reported significant effects, while only the studies that were focused on quality of life reported significant effects."
1173,3,This systematic review demonstrates the potential of telehealth interventions in improving outcomes in cancer care. 
1174,3,"However, more high-quality large-sized trials are needed to demonstrate cogent evidence of its effectiveness."
1175,4,A Digitally Competent Health Workforce: Scoping Review of Educational Frameworks
1176,0,"The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act imposes pressure on health care organizations to qualify for ""Meaningful Use"". "
1177,0,"It is assumed that portals should increase patient participation in medical decisions, but whether or not the use of portals improves outcomes remains to be seen."
1178,1,"We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. "
1179,1,"We identified any data-driven study, quantitative or qualitative, that examined a relationship between patient portals, or patient portal features, and outcomes. "
1180,1,We also wanted to relate the findings back to Meaningful Use criteria. 
1181,1,"Over 4000 articles were screened, and 27 were analyzed and summarized for this systematic review."
1182,2,"We identified 26 studies and 1 review, and we summarized their findings and applicability to our research question. "
1183,2,"Very few studies associated use of the patient portal, or its features, to improved outcomes; 37% (10/27) of papers reported improvements in medication adherence, disease awareness, self-management of disease, a decrease of office visits, an increase in preventative medicine, and an increase in extended office visits, at the patient's request for additional information. "
1184,2,"The results also show an increase in quality in terms of patient satisfaction and customer retention, but there are weak results on medical outcomes."
1185,3,The results of this review demonstrate that more health care organizations today offer features of a patient portal than in the review published in 2011. 
1186,3,"Articles reviewed rarely analyzed a full patient portal but instead analyzed features of a portal such as secure messaging, as well as disease management and monitoring. "
1187,3,"The ability of patients to be able to view their health information electronically meets the intent of Meaningful Use, Stage 2 requirements, but the ability to transmit to a third party was not found in the review."
1188,4,How Computer Literacy and Socioeconomic Status Affect Attitudes Toward a Web-Based Cohort: Results From the NutriNet-Sante Study
1189,0,"In spite of the growing literature in the field of e-epidemiology, clear evidence about computer literacy or attitudes toward respondent burden among e-cohort participants is largely lacking."
1190,1,"Self-reported data from 43,028 e-cohort participants were collected in 2013 via a Web-based questionnaire. "
1191,1,We employed unconditional logistic and linear regression analyses.
1192,2,"Approximately one-quarter of participants (23.79%, 10,235/43,028) reported being inexperienced in terms of computer use. "
1193,2,"Regarding attitudes toward participant burden, women tended to be more favorable (eg, ""The overall website use is easy"") than were men (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.59-0.71, P<.001), whereas better educated participants (>12 years of schooling) were less likely to accept the demands associated with participation (eg, "" I receive questionnaires too often"") compared to their less educated counterparts (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-1.76, P<.001)."
1194,3,"A substantial proportion of participants had low computer/Internet skills, suggesting that this does not represent a barrier to participation in Web-based cohorts. "
1195,3,"Our study also suggests that several subgroups of participants with lower computer skills (eg, women or those with lower educational level) might more readily accept the demands associated with participation in the Web cohort. "
1196,3,These findings can help guide future Web-based research strategies.
1197,4,Patient Perspectives on Online Health Information and Communication With Doctors: A Qualitative Study of Patients 50 Years Old and Over
1198,0,"As health care systems around the world shift toward models that emphasize self-care management, there is increasing pressure for patients to obtain health information online. "
1199,0,It is critical that patients are able to identify potential problems with using the Internet to diagnose and treat a health issue and that they feel comfortable communicating with their doctor about the health information they acquire from the Internet.
1200,1,"For this qualitative exploratory study, semistructured interviews were conducted with a sample of 56 adults age 50 years old and over. "
1201,1,General concerns regarding use of the Internet to diagnose and treat a health issue were examined separately for participants based on whether they had ever discussed health information obtained through the Internet with a doctor. 
1202,1,Discussions about barriers to and facilitators of communication about patient searches for health information on the Internet with a doctor were analyzed using thematic analysis.
1203,2,"Six higher-level general concerns emerged: (1) limitations in own ability, (2) credibility/limitations of online information, (3) anxiety, (4) time consumption, (5) conflict, and (6) non-physical harm. "
1204,2,The most prevalent concern raised by participants who communicated with a doctor about their online health information seeking related to the credibility or limitations in online information. 
1205,2,Participants who had never communicated with a doctor about their online health information seeking most commonly reported concerns about non-physical harm. 
1206,2,"Four barriers to communication emerged: (1) concerns about embarrassment, (2) concerns that the doctor doesn't want to hear about it, (3) belief that there is no need to bring it up, and (4) forgetting to bring it up. "
1207,2,"Facilitators of communication included: (1) having a family member present at doctor visits, (2) doctor-initiated inquiries, and (3) encountering an advertisement that suggested talking with a doctor."
1208,3,"Overall, participants displayed awareness of potential problems related to online health information seeking. "
1209,3,Findings from this study point to a set of barriers as well as facilitators of communication about online health information seeking between patients and doctors. 
1210,3,"This study highlights the need for enhanced patient communication skills, eHealth literacy assessments that are accompanied by targeted resources pointing individuals to high-quality credible online health information, and the need to remind patients of the importance of consulting a medical professional when they use online health resources to diagnose and treat a health issue."
1211,4,Use of Home Telemonitoring to Support Multidisciplinary Care of Heart Failure Patients in Finland: Randomized Controlled Trial
1212,0,"Heart failure (HF) patients suffer from frequent and repeated hospitalizations, causing a substantial economic burden on society. "
1213,0,Hospitalizations can be reduced considerably by better compliance with self-care. 
1214,0,"Home telemonitoring has the potential to boost patients' compliance with self-care, although the results are still contradictory."
1215,1,"HF patients were eligible whose left ventricular ejection fraction was lower than 35%, NYHA functional class >= 2, and who needed regular follow-up. "
1216,1,"Patients in the telemonitoring group (n = 47) measured their body weight, blood pressure, and pulse and answered symptom-related questions on a weekly basis, reporting their values to the heart failure nurse using a mobile phone app. "
1217,1,The heart failure nurse followed the status of patients weekly and if necessary contacted the patient. 
1218,1,The primary outcome was the number of HF-related hospital days. 
1219,1,Control patients (n = 47) received multidisciplinary treatment according to standard practices. 
1220,1,"Patients' clinical status, use of health care resources, adherence, and user experience from the patients' and the health care professionals' perspective were studied."
1221,2,"Adherence, calculated as a proportion of weekly submitted self-measurements, was close to 90%. "
1222,2,"No difference was found in the number of HF-related hospital days (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.812, P =. "
1223,2,"351), which was the primary outcome. "
1224,2,"The intervention group used more health care resources: they paid an increased number of visits to the nurse (IRR = 1.73, P<. "
1225,2,"001), spent more time at the nurse reception (mean difference of 48.7 minutes, P<. "
1226,2,"001), and there was a greater number of telephone contacts between the nurse and intervention patients (IRR = 3.82, P<. "
1227,2,"001 for nurse-induced contacts and IRR = 1.63, P =. "
1228,2,049 for patient-induced contacts). 
1229,2,There were no statistically significant differences in patients' clinical health status or in their self-care behavior. 
1230,2,The technology received excellent feedback from the patient and professional side with a high adherence rate throughout the study.
1231,3,Home telemonitoring did not reduce the number of patients' HF-related hospital days and did not improve the patients' clinical condition. 
1232,3,"Patients in the telemonitoring group contacted the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic more frequently, and on this way increased the use of health care resources."
1233,4,A Spanish Pillbox App for Elderly Patients Taking Multiple Medications: Randomized Controlled Trial
1234,0,Nonadherence and medication errors are common among patients with complex drug regimens. 
1235,0,"Apps for smartphones and tablets are effective for improving adherence, but they have not been tested in elderly patients with complex chronic conditions and who typically have less experience with this type of technology."
1236,1,A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with a control and an experimental group (N=99) in Spain in 2013. 
1237,1,The characteristics of ALICE were specified based on the suggestions of 3 nominal groups with a total of 23 patients and a focus group with 7 professionals. 
1238,1,"ALICE was designed for Android and iOS to allow for the personalization of prescriptions and medical advice, showing images of each of the medications (the packaging and the medication itself) together with alerts and multiple reminders for each alert. "
1239,1,The randomly assigned patients in the control group received oral and written information on the safe use of their medications and the patients in the experimental group used ALICE for 3 months. 
1240,1,"Pre and post measures included rate of missed doses and medication errors reported by patients, scores from the 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4), level of independence, self-perceived health status, and biochemical test results. "
1241,1,"In the experimental group, data were collected on their previous experience with information and communication technologies, their rating of ALICE, and their perception of the level of independence they had achieved. "
1242,1,"The intergroup intervention effects were calculated by univariate linear models and ANOVA, with the pre to post intervention differences as the dependent variables."
1243,2,"Data were obtained from 99 patients (48 and 51 in the control and experimental groups, respectively). "
1244,2,Patients in the experimental group obtained better MMAS-4 scores (P<.001) and reported fewer missed doses of medication (P=.02). 
1245,2,ALICE only helped to significantly reduce medication errors in patients with an initially higher rate of errors (P<.001). 
1246,2,"Patients with no experience with information and communication technologies reported better adherence (P<.001), fewer missed doses (P<.001), and fewer medication errors (P=.02). "
1247,2,The mean satisfaction score for ALICE was 8.5 out of 10. 
1248,2,"In all, 45 of 51 patients (88%) felt that ALICE improved their independence in managing their medications."
1249,3,"The ALICE app improves adherence, helps reduce rates of forgetting and of medication errors, and increases perceived independence in managing medication. "
1250,3,Elderly patients with no previous experience with information and communication technologies are capable of effectively using an app designed to help them take their medicine more safely.
1251,4,What Are Health-Related Users Tweeting? A Qualitative Content Analysis of Health-Related Users and Their Messages on Twitter
1252,0,Twitter is home to many health professionals who send messages about a variety of health-related topics. 
1253,0,"Amid concerns about physicians posting inappropriate content online, more in-depth knowledge about these messages is needed to understand health professionals' behavior on Twitter."
1254,1,We performed an in-depth content analysis of 700 tweets. 
1255,1,Qualitative content analysis was conducted on tweets by health users on Twitter. 
1256,1,"The primary objective was to describe the general type of content (ie, health-related versus non-health related) on Twitter authored by health professionals and further to describe health-related tweets on the basis of the type of statement made. "
1257,1,"Specific attention was given to whether a tweet was personal (as opposed to professional) or made a claim that users would expect to be supported by some level of medical evidence (ie, a ""testable"" claim). "
1258,1,"A secondary objective was to compare content types among different users, including patients, physicians, nurses, health care organizations, and others."
1259,2,Health-related users are posting a wide range of content on Twitter. 
1260,2,"Among health-related tweets, 53.2% (184/346) contained a testable claim. "
1261,2,"Of health-related tweets by providers, 17.6% (61/346) were personal in nature; 61% (59/96) made testable statements. "
1262,2,"While organizations and businesses use Twitter to promote their services and products, patient advocates are using this tool to share their personal experiences with health."
1263,3,Twitter users in health-related fields tweet about both testable claims and personal experiences. 
1264,3,"Future work should assess the relationship between testable tweets and the actual level of evidence supporting them, including how Twitter users-especially patients-interpret the content of tweets posted by health providers."
1265,4,Evaluating Self-Management Behaviors of Diabetic Patients in a Telehealthcare Program: Longitudinal Study Over 18 Months
1266,0,"Self-management is an important skill for patients with diabetes, and it involves frequent monitoring of glucose levels and behavior modification. "
1267,0,"Techniques to enhance the behavior changes of diabetic patients have been developed, such as diabetes self-management education and telehealthcare. "
1268,0,"Although the patients are engaged in self-management activities, barriers to behavior changes remain and additional work is necessary to address the impact of electronic media and telehealthcare on patient self-care behaviors."
1269,1,A telehealthcare program was conducted to assist the patients with 7 self-care activities. 
1270,1,"The telehealthcare program lasted for 18 months and included the use of a third-generation mobile telecommunications glucometer, an online diabetes self-management system, and a teleconsultant service. "
1271,1,We analyzed the data of 59 patients who participated in the telehealthcare program and 103 who did not. 
1272,1,The behavioral assessments and the HbA(1c) data were collected and statistically analyzed to determine whether the telehealthcare services had an impact on the patients. 
1273,1,We divided the 18-month period into 3 6-month intervals and analyzed the parameters of patients assisted by the telehealthcare service at different time points. 
1274,1,We also compared the results of those who were assisted by the telehealthcare service with those who were not.
1275,2,There was a significant difference in monitoring blood glucose between the beginning and the end of the patient participation (P=.046) and between the overall period and the end of patient participation (P<.001). 
1276,2,"Five behaviors were significantly different between the intervention and control patients: being active (P<.001), healthy eating (P<.001), taking medication (P<.001), healthy coping (P=.02), and problem solving (P<.001). "
1277,2,Monitoring of blood glucose was significantly different (P=.02) during the 6-12 month stage of patient participation between the intervention and control patients. 
1278,2,"A significant difference between the beginning and the 6-12 month stage of patient participation was observed for the mean value of HbA(1c) level (P=.02), and the differences between the overall HbA(1c) variability and the variability of each 6-month interval was also significant."
1279,3,Telehealthcare had a positive effect on diabetic patients. 
1280,3,"This study had enhanced blood glucose monitoring, and the patients in the program showed improvements in glycemic control. "
1281,3,"The self-care behaviors affect patient outcomes, and the changes of behavior require time to show the effects."
1282,4,The MOnitoring Resynchronization dEvices and CARdiac patiEnts (MORE-CARE) Randomized Controlled Trial: Phase 1 Results on Dynamics of Early Intervention With Remote Monitoring
1283,0,Remote monitoring (RM) in patients with advanced heart failure and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-D) may reduce delays in clinical decisions by transmitting automatic alerts. 
1284,0,"However, this strategy has never been tested specifically in this patient population, with alerts for lung fluid overload, and in a European setting."
1285,1,"In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, patients with moderate to severe heart failure implanted with CRT-D devices were randomized to a Remote group (with remote follow-up and wireless automatic alerts) or to a Control group (with standard follow-up without alerts). "
1286,1,The primary endpoint of Phase 1 was the delay between an alert event and clinical decisions related to the event in the first 154 enrolled patients followed for 1 year.
1287,2,"The median delay from device-detected events to clinical decisions was considerably shorter in the Remote group compared to the Control group: 2 (25th-75th percentile, 1-4) days vs 29 (25th-75th percentile, 3-51) days respectively, P=.004. "
1288,2,"In-hospital visits were reduced in the Remote group (2.0 visits/patient/year vs 3.2 visits/patient/year in the Control group, 37.5% relative reduction, P<.001). "
1289,2,Automatic alerts were successfully transmitted in 93% of events occurring outside the hospital in the Remote group. 
1290,2,The annual rate of all-cause hospitalizations per patient did not differ between the two groups (P=.65).
1291,3,RM in CRT-D patients with advanced heart failure allows physicians to promptly react to clinically relevant automatic alerts and significantly reduces the burden of in-hospital visits.
1292,4,"Using the Internet to Help With Diet, Weight, and Physical Activity: Results From the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)"
1293,0,The Internet offers a viable platform for cost-effective and wide-reaching health interventions. 
1294,0,"However, little is known about use of the Internet to help with diet, weight, and physical activity (DWPA) using a nationally representative sample from the United States."
1295,1,"Data on Internet users from the 2007 and 2011 iterations of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), N=4827 were analyzed using multiple logistic regression to determine the demographic correlates of using the Internet for help with DWPA. "
1296,1,"Multiple linear regression was used to test the associations between Internet use for DWPA and three health behaviors: fruit intake, vegetable intake, and physical activity."
1297,2,A larger percentage of Internet users used the Internet for DWPA in 2011 (42.83%) than in 2007 (40.43%). 
1298,2,"In general, Internet users who were younger (OR 0.98, P<.001), more educated (OR 1.40, P<.001), married (OR 1.06, P=.03), of a minority race (non-Hispanic blacks: OR 1.14, P=.02; Hispanics: OR 1.42, P=.01), and who had a higher Body Mass Index (BMI) (OR 1.04, P<.001) were more likely to use the Internet for DWPA. "
1299,2,"Across survey years, gender was not associated with using the Internet for DWPA (OR 1.03, P=.12), but there was a significant interaction between survey year and gender (OR 1.95, P=.002); in 2007, men were more likely to use the Internet for DWPA, but women were more likely to do so in 2011. "
1300,2,"Using the Internet for DWPA was associated with more vegetable intake (B=.22, P=.002), more fruit intake (B=.19, P=.001), and more moderate exercise (B=.25, P=.001), although the strength of the associations between using the Internet for DWPA and fruit intake and exercise was weaker in 2011 than in 2007."
1301,3,"Contrary to prior research, our population-level study did not show a pronounced gender difference in the use of the Internet for DWPA. "
1302,3,"Our results support the increasing viability of the Internet as a platform for behavior change intervention, as a growing percentage of Internet users are turning to the Internet for help with DWPA. "
1303,3,"Additionally, using the Internet for DWPA is associated with better DWPA-related health behaviors."
1304,4,Tablet-Based Strength-Balance Training to Motivate and Improve Adherence to Exercise in Independently Living Older People: A Phase II Preclinical Exploratory Trial
1305,0,"Reaction time, coordination, and cognition performance typically diminish in older adults, which may lead to gait impairments, falls, and injuries. "
1306,0,"Regular strength-balance exercises are highly recommended to reduce this problem and to improve health, well-being, and independence in old age. "
1307,0,"However, many older people face a lack of motivation in addition to other strong barriers to exercise. "
1308,0,"We developed ActiveLifestyle, an information technology (IT)-based system for active and healthy aging aiming at improving balance and strength. "
1309,0,"ActiveLifestyle is a training app that runs on a tablet and assists, monitors, and motivates older people to follow personalized training plans autonomously at home."
1310,1,"A total of 44 older adults followed personalized, 12-week strength and balance training plans. "
1311,1,All participants performed the exercises autonomously at home. 
1312,1,"Questionnaires were used to assess the technological familiarity and stage of behavior change, as well as the effectiveness of the motivation instruments adopted by ActiveLifestyle. "
1313,1,Adherence to the exercise plan was evaluated using performance data collected by the app and through information given by the participants during the study. 
1314,1,Pretests and posttests were performed to evaluate gait speed of the participants before and after the study.
1315,2,"Participants were 75 years (SD 6), predominantly female (64%), held a trade or professional diploma (54%), and their past profession was in a sitting position (43%). "
1316,2,"Of the 44 participants who enrolled, 33 (75%) completed the study. "
1317,2,The app proved to assist and motivate independently living and healthy older adults to autonomously perform strength-balance exercises (median 6 on a 7-point Likert scale). 
1318,2,"Social motivation strategies proved more effective than individual strategies to stimulate the participants to comply with the training plan, as well as to change their behavior permanently toward a more physically active lifestyle. "
1319,2,The exercises were effective to improve preferred and fast gait speed.
1320,3,ActiveLifestyle assisted and motivated independently living and healthy older people to autonomously perform strength-balance exercises over 12 weeks and had low dropout rates. 
1321,3,The social motivation strategies were more effective to stimulate the participants to comply with the training plan and remain on the intervention. 
1322,3,The adoption of assistive technology devices for physical intervention tends to motivate and retain older people exercising for longer periods of time.
1323,4,Development of an Obesity Management Ontology Based on the Nursing Process for the Mobile-Device Domain
1324,0,Lifestyle modification is the most important factor in the management of obesity. 
1325,0,It is therefore essential to enhance client participation in voluntary and continuous weight control.
1326,1,"An obesity management ontology was developed in seven phases: (1) defining the scope of obesity management, (2) selecting a foundational ontology, (3) extracting the concepts, (4) assigning relationships between these concepts, (5) evaluating representative layers of ontology content, (6) representing the ontology formally with Protege, and (7) developing a prototype application for obesity management."
1327,2,"Behavioral interventions, dietary advice, and physical activity were proposed as obesity management strategies. "
1328,2,"The nursing process was selected as a foundation of ontology, representing the obesity management process. "
1329,2,"We extracted 127 concepts, which included assessment data (eg, sex, body mass index, and waist circumference), inferred data to represent nursing diagnoses and evaluations (eg, degree of and reason for obesity, and success or failure of lifestyle modifications), and implementation (eg, education and advice). "
1330,2,"The relationship linking concepts were ""part of"", ""instance of"", ""derives of"", ""derives into"", ""has plan"", ""followed by"", and ""has intention"". "
1331,2,The concepts and relationships were formally represented using Protege. 
1332,2,The evaluation score of the obesity management ontology was 4.5 out of 5. 
1333,2,An Android-based obesity management application comprising both agent and client parts was developed.
1334,3,We have developed an ontology for representing obesity management with the nursing process as a foundation of ontology.
1335,4,Online Social Network Use by Health Care Providers in a High Traffic Patient Care Environment
1336,0,"The majority of workers, regardless of age or occupational status, report engaging in personal Internet use in the workplace. "
1337,0,There is little understanding of the impact that personal Internet use may have on patient care in acute clinical settings.
1338,1,The research team analyzed anonymous network utilization records for 68 workstations located in the emergency medicine department within one academic medical center for 15 consecutive days (12/29/2009 to 1/12/2010). 
1339,1,This data was compared to ED work index (EDWIN) data derived by the hospital information systems.
1340,2,"Health care workers spent an accumulated 4349 minutes (72.5 hours) browsing Facebook, staff cumulatively visited Facebook 9369 times and spent, on average, 12.0 minutes per hour browsing Facebook. "
1341,2,"There was a statistically significant difference in the time spent on Facebook according to time of day (19.8 minutes per hour versus 4.3 minutes per hour, P<.001). "
1342,2,"There was a significant, positive correlation between EDWIN scores and time spent on Facebook (r=.266, P<.001)."
1343,3,Facebook use constituted a substantive percentage of staff time during the 15-day observation period. 
1344,3,Facebook use increased with increased patient volume and severity within the ED.
1345,4,Which Bundles of Features in a Web-Based Personally Controlled Health Management System Are Associated With Consumer Help-Seeking Behaviors for Physical and Emotional Well-Being?
1346,0,"Personally controlled health management systems (PCHMS), which include a personal health record (PHR), health management tools, and consumer resources, represent the next stage in consumer eHealth systems. "
1347,0,"It is still unclear, however, what features contribute to an engaging and efficacious PCHMS."
1348,1,A one-group pre/posttest online prospective study was conducted on a university campus to measure use of a PCHMS for physical and emotional well-being needs during a university academic semester (July to November 2011). 
1349,1,"The PCHMS integrated an untethered personal health record (PHR) with well-being journeys, social forums, polls, diaries, and online messaging links with a health service provider, where journeys provide information for consumer participants to engage with clinicians and health services in an actionable way. "
1350,1,1985 students and staff aged 18 and above with access to the Internet were recruited online. 
1351,1,"Logistic regression, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, and chi-square analyses were used to associate participants' help-seeking behaviors and health service utilization with PCHMS usage among the 709 participants eligible for analysis."
1352,2,"A dose-response association was detected between the number of times a user logged into the PCHMS and the number of visits to a health care professional (P=.01), to the university counselling service (P=.03), and help-seeking rates (formal or informal) for emotional well-being matters (P=.03). "
1353,2,No significant association was detected between participant pre-study characteristics or well-being ratings at different PCHMS login frequencies. 
1354,2,"Health service utilization was strongly correlated with use of a bundle of features including: online appointment booking (primary care: OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.01-3.00; counselling: OR 6.04, 95% CI 2.30-15.85), personal health record (health care professional: OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.63-4.89), the poll (health care professional: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02-2.12), and diary (counselling: OR 4.92, 95% CI 1.40-17.35). "
1355,2,"Help-seeking for physical well-being matters was only correlated with use of the personal health record (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.18-2.53). "
1356,2,"Help-seeking for emotional well-being concerns (including visits to the university counselling service) was correlated with a bundle comprising the poll (formal or informal help-seeking: OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.05), diary (counselling: OR 4.92, 95% CI 1.40-17.35), and online appointment booking (counselling: OR 6.04, 95% CI 2.30-15.85)."
1357,3,Frequent usage of a PCHMS was significantly associated with increased consumer health service utilization and help-seeking rates for emotional health matters in a university sample. 
1358,3,Different bundles of PCHMS features were associated with physical and emotional well-being matters. 
1359,3,PCHMS appears to be a promising mechanism to engage consumers in help-seeking or health service utilization for physical and emotional well-being matters.
1360,4,Multilevel Growth Curve Analyses of Treatment Effects of a Web-Based Intervention for Stress Reduction: Randomized Controlled Trial
1361,0,"Stress is commonly experienced by many people and it is a contributing factor to many mental and physical health conditions, However, few efforts have been made to develop and test the effects of interventions for stress."
1362,1,We employed a randomized controlled trial in this study. 
1363,1,Participants were recruited online via Facebook and randomly assigned to either the stress intervention or a control condition. 
1364,1,The Web-based stress intervention was fully automated and consisted of 13 sessions over 1 month. 
1365,1,The controls were informed that they would get access to the intervention after the final data collection. 
1366,1,"Data were collected at baseline and at 1, 2, and 6 months after intervention onset by means of online questionnaires. "
1367,1,"Outcomes were stress, mindfulness, and procrastination, which were all measured at every measurement occasion."
1368,2,A total of 259 participants were included and were allocated to either the stress intervention (n=126) or the control condition (n=133). 
1369,2,"Participants in the intervention and control group were comparable at baseline; however, results revealed that participants in the stress intervention followed a statistically different (ie, cubic) developmental trajectory in stress levels over time compared to the controls. "
1370,2,"A growth curve analysis showed that participants in the stress intervention (unstandardized beta coefficient [B]=-3.45, P=.008) recovered more quickly compared to the control group (B=-0.81, P=.34) from baseline to 1 month. "
1371,2,"Although participants in the stress intervention did show increases in stress levels during the study period (B=2.23, P=.008), long-term stress levels did decrease again toward study end at 6 months (B=-0.28, P=.009). "
1372,2,"Stress levels in the control group, however, remained largely unchanged after 1 month (B=-0.29, P=.61) and toward 6 months (B=-0.03, P=.67). "
1373,2,"Mediation analyses showed nonlinear (ie, cubic) specific indirect effects of mindfulness and a linear specific indirect effect of procrastination on stress. "
1374,2,"In simple terms, the intervention increased mindfulness and decreased procrastination, which was related to lower stress levels. "
1375,2,"Finally, the effect of the stress intervention was independent of participants' gender, age, or education."
1376,3,The results from this randomized controlled trial suggest that a Web-based intervention can reduce levels of stress in a normal population and that both mindfulness and procrastination may be important components included in future eHealth interventions for stress.
1377,4,Web 2.0 Chronic Disease Self-Management for Older Adults: A Systematic Review
1378,0,Participatory Web 2.0 interventions promote collaboration to support chronic disease self-management. 
1379,0,Growth in Web 2.0 interventions has led to the emergence of e-patient communication tools that enable older adults to (1) locate and share disease management information and (2) receive interactive healthcare advice. 
1380,0,The evolution of older e-patients contributing to Web 2.0 health and medical forums has led to greater opportunities for achieving better chronic disease outcomes. 
1381,0,"To date, there are no review articles investigating the planning, implementation, and evaluation of Web 2.0 chronic disease self-management interventions for older adults."
1382,1,A systematic literature search was conducted using six popular health science databases. 
1383,1,"The RE-AIM (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) model was used to organize findings and compute a study quality score (SQS) for 15 reviewed articles."
1384,2,Most interventions were adopted for delivery by multidisciplinary healthcare teams and tested among small samples of white females with diabetes. 
1385,2,Studies indicated that Web 2.0 participants felt greater self-efficacy for managing their disease(s) and benefitted from communicating with health care providers and/or website moderators to receive feedback and social support. 
1386,2,"Participants noted asynchronous communication tools (eg, email, discussion boards) and progress tracking features (eg, graphical displays of uploaded personal data) as being particularly useful for self-management support. "
1387,2,"Despite high attrition being noted as problematic, this review suggests that greater Web 2.0 engagement may be associated with improvements in health behaviors (eg, physical activity) and health status (eg, HRQoL). "
1388,2,"However, few studies indicated statistically significant improvements in medication adherence, biological outcomes, or health care utilization. "
1389,2,"Mean SQS scores were notably low (mean=63%, SD 18%). "
1390,2,Studies were judged to be weakest on the Maintenance dimension of RE-AIM; 13 reviewed studies (87%) did not describe any measures taken to sustain Web 2.0 effects past designated study time periods. 
1391,2,Detailed process and impact evaluation frameworks were also missing in almost half (n=7) of the reviewed interventions.
1392,3,There is need for a greater understanding of the costs and benefits associated with using patient-centered Web 2.0 technologies for chronic disease self-management. 
1393,3,"More research is needed to determine whether the long-term effectiveness of these programs is sustainable among larger, more diverse samples of chronically ill patients. "
1394,3,"The effective translation of new knowledge, social technologies, and engagement techniques will likely result in novel approaches for empowering, engaging, and educating older adults with chronic disease. "
1395,4,Effectiveness of a Web-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Tool to Improve Mental Well-Being in the General Population: Randomized Controlled Trial
1396,0,Interventions to promote mental well-being can bring benefits to the individual and to society. 
1397,0,The Internet can facilitate the large-scale and low-cost delivery of individually targeted health promoting interventions.
1398,1,This was a randomized trial with a waiting-list control. 
1399,1,"Using advertisements on a national health portal and through its mailing list, we recruited 3070 participants aged 18 or over, resident in England, and willing to give their email address and access a fully automated Web-based intervention. "
1400,1,The intervention (MoodGYM) consisted of 5 interactive modules that teach cognitive-behavioral principles. 
1401,1,Participants in the intervention arm received weekly email reminders to access the intervention. 
1402,1,The control group received access to the intervention after the trial was completed and received no specific intervention or email reminders. 
1403,1,Outcomes were assessed by using self-completion questionnaires. 
1404,1,The primary outcome was mental well-being measured with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). 
1405,1,"Secondary outcomes were Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) depression scores, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) anxiety scores, EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D) quality of life scores, physical activity, and health service use. "
1406,1,"All outcomes were measured at baseline, and at 6- and 12-week follow-ups."
1407,2,A total of 1529 (49.80%) participants completed final follow-up at 12 weeks. 
1408,2,Retention was 73.11% (1123/1536) in the control arm and 26.47% (406/1534) in the intervention arm. 
1409,2,No relationship between baseline measures and withdrawal could be established. 
1410,2,"The analysis of WEMWBS mental well-being scores using a linear mixed model for repeated measures showed no difference between intervention and control group at baseline (difference -0.124 points, 95% CI -0.814 to 0.566), and significant improvements for the intervention group at 6 weeks (2.542 points, 95% CI 1.693-3.390) and at 12 weeks (2.876 points, 95% CI 1.933-3.819). "
1411,2,The model showed a highly significant (P<.001) intervention by time interaction effect. 
1412,2,There were also significant improvements in self-rated scores of depression and anxiety. 
1413,2,"Given the high level of attrition, a sensitivity analysis with imputed missing values was undertaken that also showed a significant positive effect of the intervention."
1414,3,Participants allocated to the intervention arm had an average increase of approximately 3 points on the WEMWBS scale compared to no increase for participants in the control group. 
1415,3,Three points on this scale is approximately one-third of a standard deviation. 
1416,3,"In a low-cost automated intervention designed to shift the population distribution of mental well-being, a small difference per individual could yield a major benefit in population terms. "
1417,3,"In common with other Web-based interventions, there were high rates of attrition. "
1418,3,"Further work is needed to improve acceptability, to evaluate against placebo effect, and to disaggregate the effect on mental well-being from the effect on depression and anxiety. "
1419,4,How Current Are Leading Evidence-Based Medical Textbooks? An Analytic Survey of Four Online Textbooks
1420,0,The consistency of treatment recommendations of evidence-based medical textbooks with more recently published evidence has not been investigated to date. 
1421,0,Inconsistencies could affect the quality of medical care.
1422,1,"Summarized treatment recommendations in 200 clinical topics (ie, disease states) covered in four evidence-based textbooks-UpToDate, Physicians' Information Education Resource (PIER), DynaMed, and Best Practice-were compared with articles identified in an evidence rating service (McMaster Premium Literature Service, PLUS) since the date of the most recent topic updates in each textbook. "
1423,1,"Textbook treatment recommendations were compared with article results to determine if the articles provided different, new conclusions. "
1424,1,"From these findings, the proportion of topics which potentially require updating in each textbook was calculated."
1425,2,478 clinical topics were assessed for inclusion to find 200 topics that were addressed by all four textbooks. 
1426,2,"The proportion of topics for which there was 1 or more recently published articles found in PLUS with evidence that differed from the textbooks' treatment recommendations was 23% (95% CI 17-29%) for DynaMed, 52% (95% CI 45-59%) for UpToDate, 55% (95% CI 48-61%) for PIER, and 60% (95% CI 53-66%) for Best Practice (chi(2)(3)=65.3, P<.001). "
1427,2,"The time since the last update for each textbook averaged from 170 days (range 131-209) for DynaMed, to 488 days (range 423-554) for PIER (P<.001 across all textbooks)."
1428,3,"In online evidence-based textbooks, the proportion of topics with potentially outdated treatment recommendations varies substantially. "
1429,4,Factors Affecting Mobile Diabetes Monitoring Adoption Among Physicians: Questionnaire Study and Path Model
1430,0,Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes often find it difficult to control their blood glucose level on a daily basis because of distance or physical incapacity. 
1431,0,"With the increase in Internet-enabled smartphone use, this problem can be resolved by adopting a mobile diabetes monitoring system. "
1432,0,"Most existing studies have focused on patients' usability perceptions, whereas little attention has been paid to physicians' intentions to adopt this technology."
1433,1,A questionnaire survey of physicians was conducted in Japan. 
1434,1,"The structured questionnaire was prepared in a context of a mobile diabetes monitoring system that controls blood glucose, weight, physical activity, diet, insulin and medication, and blood pressure. "
1435,1,"Following a thorough description of mobile diabetes monitoring with a graphical image, questions were asked relating to system quality, information quality, service quality, health improvement, ubiquitous control, privacy and security concerns, perceived value, subjective norms, and intention to use mobile diabetes monitoring. "
1436,1,The data were analyzed by partial least squares (PLS) path modeling.
1437,2,"In total, 471 physicians participated from 47 prefectures across Japan, of whom 134 were specialized in internal and gastrointestinal medicine. "
1438,2,Nine hypotheses were tested with both the total sample and the specialist subsample; results were similar for both samples in terms of statistical significance and the strength of path coefficients. 
1439,2,"We found that system quality, information quality, and service quality significantly affect overall quality. "
1440,2,Overall quality determines the extent to which physicians perceive the value of mobile health monitoring. 
1441,2,"However, in contrast to our initial predictions, overall quality does not have a significant direct effect on the intention to use mobile diabetes monitoring. "
1442,2,"With regard to net benefits, both ubiquitous control and health improvement are significant predictors. "
1443,2,"Net benefits in turn significantly motivate physicians to use mobile health monitoring, and has a strong influence on perceived value. "
1444,2,Perceived value and subjective norms are predictors of intention to use. 
1445,2,"In our sample, concerns over privacy and security risk have no significant effects on intention to use mobile diabetes monitoring. "
1446,2,"Among the 3 control variables, only age significantly affected intention to use mobile diabetes monitoring, whereas experience and gender were not significant predictors of intention."
1447,3,Physicians consider perceived value and net benefits as the most important motivators to use mobile diabetes monitoring. 
1448,3,"Overall quality assessment does affect their intention to use this technology, but only indirectly through perceived value. "
1449,3,"Net benefits seem to be a strong driver in both a direct and indirect manner, implying that physicians may perceive health improvement with ubiquitous control as a true utility by enhancing cost-effective monitoring, and simultaneously recognize it as a way to create value for their clinical practices. "
1450,4,"Building a Transnational Biosurveillance Network Using Semantic Web Technologies: Requirements, Design, and Preliminary Evaluation"
1451,0,Antimicrobial resistance has reached globally alarming levels and is becoming a major public health threat. 
1452,0,"Lack of efficacious antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems was identified as one of the causes of increasing resistance, due to the lag time between new resistances and alerts to care providers. "
1453,0,Several initiatives to track drug resistance evolution have been developed. 
1454,0,"However, no effective real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring system is available publicly."
1455,1,"Following the agile software development methodology, we derived the main requirements needed for effective antimicrobial resistance monitoring, from which we proposed a decentralized monitoring architecture based on the Semantic Web stack. "
1456,1,The architecture uses an ontology-driven approach to promote the integration of a network of sentinel hospitals or laboratories. 
1457,1,Local databases are wrapped into semantic data repositories that automatically expose local computing-formalized laboratory information in the Web. 
1458,1,"A central source mediator, based on local reasoning, coordinates the access to the semantic end points. "
1459,1,"On the user side, a user-friendly Web interface provides access and graphical visualization to the integrated views."
1460,2,We designed and implemented the online Antimicrobial Resistance Trend Monitoring System (ARTEMIS) in a pilot network of seven European health care institutions sharing 70+ million triples of information about drug resistance and consumption. 
1461,2,"Evaluation of the computing performance of the mediator demonstrated that, on average, query response time was a few seconds (mean 4.3, SD 0.1x10(2) seconds). "
1462,2,"Clinical pertinence assessment showed that resistance trends automatically calculated by ARTEMIS had a strong positive correlation with the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) (rho = .86, P < .001) and the Sentinel Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance in Switzerland (SEARCH) (rho = .84, P < .001) systems. "
1463,2,"Furthermore, mean resistance rates extracted by ARTEMIS were not significantly different from those of either EARS-Net (Delta = +/- 0.130; 95% confidence interval -0 to 0.030; P < .001) or SEARCH (Delta = +/- 0.042; 95% confidence interval -0.004 to 0.028; P = .004)."
1464,3,We introduce a distributed monitoring architecture that can be used to build transnational antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks. 
1465,3,Results indicated that the Semantic Web-based approach provided an efficient and reliable solution for development of eHealth architectures that enable online antimicrobial resistance monitoring from heterogeneous data sources. 
1466,3,"In future, we expect that more health care institutions can join the ARTEMIS network so that it can provide a large European and wider biosurveillance network that can be used to detect emerging bacterial resistance in a multinational context and support public health actions."
1467,4,A 12-Week Commercial Web-Based Weight-Loss Program for Overweight and Obese Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Basic Versus Enhanced Features
1468,0,"The development and use of Web-based programs for weight loss is increasing rapidly, yet they have rarely been evaluated using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). "
1469,0,"Interestingly, most people who attempt weight loss use commercially available programs, yet it is very uncommon for commercial programs to be evaluated independently or rigorously."
1470,1,"This purely Web-based trial using a closed online user group was an assessor-blinded RCT with participants randomly allocated to the basic or enhanced 12-week Web-based program, based on social cognitive theory, or the control, with body mass index (BMI) as the primary outcome."
1471,2,"We enrolled 309 adults (129/309, 41.8% male, BMI mean 32.3, SD 4 kg/m(2)) with 84.1% (260/309) retention at 12 weeks. "
1472,2,"Intention-to-treat analysis showed that both intervention groups reduced their BMI compared with the controls (basic: -0.72, SD 1.1 kg/m(2), enhanced: -1.0, SD 1.4, control: 0.15, SD 0.82; P < .001) and lost significant weight (basic: -2.1, SD 3.3 kg, enhanced: -3.0, SD 4.1, control: 0.4, SD 2.3; P < .001) with changes in waist circumference (basic: -2.0, SD 3.5 cm, enhanced: -3.2, SD 4.7, control: 0.5, SD 3.0; P < .001) and waist-to-height ratio (basic: -0.01, SD 0.02, enhanced: -0.02, SD 0.03, control: 0.0, SD 0.02; P < .001), but no differences were observed between the basic and enhanced groups. "
1473,2,The addition of personalized e-feedback and contact provided limited additional benefits compared with the basic program.
1474,3,A commercial Web-based weight-loss program can be efficacious across a range of weight-related outcomes and lifestyle behaviors and achieve clinically important weight loss. 
1475,3,"Although the provision of additional personalized feedback did not facilitate greater weight loss after 12 weeks, the impact of superior participant retention on longer-term outcomes requires further study. "
1476,3,Further research is required to determine the optimal mix of program features that lead to the biggest treatment impact over time.
1477,4,Mobile Phone-Based Telemonitoring for Heart Failure Management: A Randomized Controlled Trial
1478,0,"Previous trials of telemonitoring for heart failure management have reported inconsistent results, largely due to diverse intervention and study designs. "
1479,0,"Mobile phones are becoming ubiquitous and economical, but the feasibility and efficacy of a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system have not been determined."
1480,1,One hundred patients were recruited from a heart function clinic and randomized into telemonitoring and control groups. 
1481,1,"The telemonitoring group (N = 50) took daily weight and blood pressure readings and weekly single-lead ECGs, and answered daily symptom questions on a mobile phone over 6 months. "
1482,1,Readings were automatically transmitted wirelessly to the mobile phone and then to data servers. 
1483,1,Instructions were sent to the patients' mobile phones and alerts to a cardiologist's mobile phone as required.
1484,2,"Baseline questionnaires were completed and returned by 94 patients, and 84 patients returned post-study questionnaires. "
1485,2,About 70% of telemonitoring patients completed at least 80% of their possible daily readings. 
1486,2,"The change in quality of life from baseline to post-study, as measured with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, was significantly greater for the telemonitoring group compared to the control group (P=.05). "
1487,2,A between-group analysis also found greater post-study self-care maintenance (measured with the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index) for the telemonitoring group (P=.03). 
1488,2,"Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, self-care management, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved significantly for both groups from baseline to post-study, but did not show a between-group difference. "
1489,2,"However, a subgroup within-group analysis using the data from the 63 patients who had attended the heart function clinic for more than 6 months revealed the telemonitoring group had significant improvements from baseline to post-study in BNP (decreased by 150 pg/mL, P = .02), LVEF (increased by 7.4%, P = .005) and self-care maintenance (increased by 7 points, P = .05) and management (increased by 14 points, P = .03), while the control group did not. "
1490,2,"No differences were found between the telemonitoring and control groups in terms of hospitalization, mortality, or emergency department visits, but the trial was underpowered to detect differences in these metrics."
1491,3,Our findings provide evidence of improved quality of life through improved self-care and clinical management from a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system. 
1492,3,"The use of the mobile phone-based system had high adherence and was feasible for patients, including the elderly and those with no experience with mobile phones."
1493,4,"Website Quality, Expectation, Confirmation, and End User Satisfaction: The Knowledge-Intensive Website of the Korean National Cancer Information Center"
1494,0,The fact that patient satisfaction with primary care clinical practices and physician-patient communications has decreased gradually has brought a new opportunity to the online channel as a supplementary service to provide additional information.
1495,1,"An empirical study was conducted at the National Cancer Center (NCC), Republic of Korea (South Korea), by evaluating its official website. "
1496,1,A user survey was administered containing items to measure subjectively perceived website quality and expectation-confirmation attributes. 
1497,1,A study sample of 198 usable responses was used for further analysis. 
1498,1,We used the structural equation model to test the proposed research model.
1499,2,"Knowledge expectation exhibited a positive effect on knowledge confirmation (beta = .27, P < .001). "
1500,2,"The paths from information quality, information presentation, and website attractiveness to knowledge confirmation were also positive and significant (beta = .24, P < .001; beta = .29, P < .001; beta = .18, P < .001, respectively). "
1501,2,"Moreover, the effect of knowledge confirmation on perceived usefulness was also positively significant (beta = .64, P < .001). "
1502,2,"Knowledge expectation together with knowledge confirmation and perceived usefulness also significantly affected end user satisfaction (beta = .22 P < .001; beta = .39, P < .001; beta = .25, P < .001, respectively)."
1503,3,"Theoretically, this study has (1) identified knowledge-intensive website attributes, (2) enhanced the theoretical foundation of eHealth from the information systems (IS) perspective by adopting the expectation-confirmation theory (ECT), and (3) examined the importance of information and knowledge attributes and explained their impact on user satisfaction. "
1504,3,"Practically, our empirical results suggest that perceived website quality (ie, information quality, information presentation, and website attractiveness) is a core requirement for knowledge building. "
1505,3,"In addition, our study has also shown that knowledge confirmation has a greater effect on satisfaction than both knowledge expectation and perceived usefulness."
1506,4,Exploratory Study of Web-Based Planning and Mobile Text Reminders in an Overweight Population
1507,0,Forming specific health plans can help translate good intentions into action. 
1508,0,Mobile text reminders can further enhance the effects of planning on behavior.
1509,1,"Of 1013 men and women recruited online, 858 were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 conditions: a planning tool (PT), combined planning tool and text reminders (PTT), and a control group. "
1510,1,All outcome measures were assessed by online self-reports. 
1511,1,Analysis of covariance was used to analyze the data.
1512,2,"Participants allocated to the PT (mean(saturatedfat) 3.6, mean(copingplanning) 3) and PTT (mean(saturatedfat) 3.5, mean(copingplanning) 3.1) reported a lower consumption of high-fat foods (F-2,F-571 = 4.74, P = .009) and higher levels of coping planning (F-2,F-571 = 7.22, P < .001) than the control group (mean(saturatedfat) 3.9, mean(copingplanning) 2.8). "
1513,2,"Participants in the PTT condition also reported smaller portion sizes of high-fat foods (mean 2.8; F-2,F-569 = 4.12, P = .0) than the control group (mean(portions) 3.1). "
1514,2,The reduction in portion size was driven primarily by the male participants in the PTT (P = .003). 
1515,2,"We found no significant group differences in terms of percentage saturated fat intake, intentions, action planning, self-efficacy, or feedback on the intervention."
1516,3,These findings support the use of Web-based tools and mobile technologies to change dietary behavior. 
1517,3,The combination of a fully automated Web-based planning tool with mobile text reminders led to lower self-reported consumption of high-fat foods and greater reductions in portion sizes than in a control condition.
1518,4,A Web-Based Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) to Assess Patient Perception in Hospitalization
1519,0,Many hospitals have adopted mobile nursing carts that can be easily rolled up to a patient's bedside to access charts and help nurses perform their rounds. 
1520,0,"However, few papers have reported data regarding the use of wireless computers on wheels (COW) at patients' bedsides to collect questionnaire-based information of their perception of hospitalization on discharge from the hospital."
1521,2,Patient measures derived from CAT and NAT were highly correlated (r = 0.98) and their measurement precisions were not statistically different (P = .14). 
1522,2,"CAT required fewer questions than NAT (an efficiency gain of 42%), suggesting a reduced burden for patients. "
1523,2,There were no significant differences between groups in terms of gender and other demographic characteristics.
1524,3,CAT-based administration of surveys of patient perception substantially reduced patient burden without compromising the precision of measuring patients' perceptions of hospitalization. 
1525,3,The Excel module of animation-CAT on the wireless COW that we developed is recommended for use in hospitals.
1526,4,Managing the Personal Side of Health: How Patient Expertise Differs from the Expertise of Clinicians
1527,0,"When patients need health information to manage their personal health, they turn to both health professionals and other patients. "
1528,0,"Yet, we know little about how the information exchanged among patients (ie, patient expertise) contrasts with the information offered by health professionals (ie, clinician expertise). "
1529,0,"Understanding how patients' experiential expertise contrasts with the medical expertise of health professionals is necessary to inform the design of peer-support tools that meet patients' needs, particularly with the growing prevalence of largely unguided advice sharing through Internet-based social software."
1530,1,"Through a comparative content analysis of topics discussed and recommendations offered in Internet message boards and books, we contrasted the topic, form, and style of expertise shared in sources of patient expertise with sources of clinician expertise."
1531,0,"As the incidence of H1N1 increases, the lay public may turn to the Internet for information about natural supplements for prevention and treatment."
1532,1,"This was a retrospective observational infodemiology study of indexed websites and Internet search activity over the period January 1, 2009, through November 15, 2009. "
1533,1,The setting is the Internet as indexed by Google with aggregated Internet user data. 
1534,1,"The main outcome measures were the frequency of ""hits"" or webpages containing terms relating to natural supplements co-occurring with H1N1/swine flu, terms relating to natural supplements co-occurring with H1N1/swine flu proportional to all terms relating to natural supplements, webpage rank, webpage entropy, and temporal trend in search activity."
1535,2,A large number of websites support information about supplements and H1N1. 
1536,2,The supplement with the highest proportion of H1N1/swine flu information was a homeopathic remedy known as Oscillococcinum that has no known side effects; supplements with the next highest proportions have known side effects and interactions. 
1537,2,Webpages with both supplement and H1N1/swine flu information were less likely to be medically curated or authoritative. 
1538,2,Search activity for supplements was temporally related to H1N1/swine flu-related news reports and events.
1539,3,The prevalence of nonauthoritative webpages with information about supplements in the context of H1N1/swine flu and the increasing number of searches for these pages suggest that the public is interested in alternatives to traditional prevention and treatment of H1N1. 
1540,3,The quality of this information is often questionable and clinicians should be cognizant that patients may be at risk of adverse events associated with the use of supplements for H1N1.
1541,4,"Social Cognitive Determinants of Nutrition and Physical Activity Among Web-Health Users Enrolling in an Online Intervention: The Influence of Social Support, Self-Efficacy, Outcome Expectations, and Self-Regulation"
1542,0,The Internet is a trusted source of health information for growing majorities of Web users. 
1543,0,The promise of online health interventions will be realized with the development of purely online theory-based programs for Web users that are evaluated for program effectiveness and the application of behavior change theory within the online environment. 
1544,0,"Little is known, however, about the demographic, behavioral, or psychosocial characteristics of Web-health users who represent potential participants in online health promotion research. "
1545,0,"Nor do we understand how Web users' psychosocial characteristics relate to their health behavior-information essential to the development of effective, theory-based online behavior change interventions."
1546,1,"Directed to the WB-GTH site by advertisements through online social and professional networks and through print and online media, participants were screened, consented, and assessed with demographic, physical activity, psychosocial, and food frequency questionnaires online (taking a total of about 1.25 hours); they also kept a 7-day log of daily steps and minutes walked."
1547,2,"From 4700 visits to the site, 963 Web users consented to enroll in the study: 83% (803) were female, participants' mean age was 44.4 years (SD 11.03 years), 91% (873) were white, and 61% (589) were college graduates; participants' median annual household income was approximately US $85,000. "
1548,2,"Participants' daily step counts were in the low-active range (mean 6485.78, SD 2352.54) and overall dietary levels were poor (total fat g/day, mean 77.79, SD 41.96; percent kcal from fat, mean 36.51, SD 5.92; fiber g/day, mean 17.74, SD 7.35; and fruit and vegetable servings/day, mean 4.03, SD 2.33). "
1549,2,"The Web-health users had good self-efficacy and outcome expectations for health behavior change; however, they perceived little social support for making these changes and engaged in few self-regulatory behaviors. "
1550,2,"Consistent with SCT, theoretical models provided good fit to Web-users' data (root mean square error of the approximation [RMSEA] < .05). "
1551,2,Perceived social support and use of self-regulatory behaviors were strong predictors of physical activity and nutrition behavior. 
1552,2,"Web users' self-efficacy was also a good predictor of healthier levels of physical activity and dietary fat but not of fiber, fruits, and vegetables. "
1553,2,"Social support and self-efficacy indirectly predicted behavior through self-regulation, and social support had indirect effects through self-efficacy."
1554,3,"Results suggest Web-health users visiting and ultimately participating in online health interventions may likely be middle-aged, well-educated, upper middle class women whose detrimental health behaviors put them at risk of obesity, heart disease, some cancers, and diabetes. "
1555,3,"The success of Internet physical activity and nutrition interventions may depend on the extent to which they lead users to develop self-efficacy for behavior change, but perhaps as important, the extent to which these interventions help them garner social-support for making changes. "
1556,3,"Success of these interventions may also depend on the extent to which they provide a platform for setting goals, planning, tracking, and providing feedback on targeted behaviors."
1557,4,Supporting Informed Decision Making Online in 20 Minutes: An Observational Web-log Study of a PSA Test Decision Aid
1558,0,"Web-based decision aids are known to have an effect on knowledge, attitude, and behavior; important components of informed decision making. "
1559,0,"We know what decision aids achieve in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but we still know very little about how they are used and how this relates to the informed decision making outcome measures."
1560,1,"We conducted an observational web-log analysis of users of an online decision aid, Prosdex. "
1561,1,"Men between 50 and 75 years of age were recruited for an associated RCT from 26 general practices across South Wales, United Kingdom. "
1562,1,Men allocated to one arm of the RCT were included in the current study. 
1563,1,Time and usage data were derived from website log files. 
1564,1,Components of informed decision making were measured by an online questionnaire.
1565,2,Available for analysis were 82 web-logs. 
1566,2,"Overall, there was large variation in the use of Prosdex. "
1567,2,The mean total time spent on the site was 20 minutes. 
1568,2,The mean number of pages accessed was 32 (SD 21) out of a possible 60 pages. 
1569,2,"Significant associations were found between increased usage and increased knowledge (Spearman rank correlation [rho] = 0.69, P < .01), between increased usage and less favorable attitude towards PSA testing (rho = -0.52, P < .01), and between increased usage and reduced intention to undergo PSA testing (rho = -0.44, P < .01). "
1570,2,A bimodal distribution identified two types of user: low access and high access users.
1571,3,"Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making, the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme. "
1572,3,"However, developers realistically have roughly 20 minutes to provide useful information that will support informed decision making when the patient uses a web-based interface. "
1573,3,Future decision aids need to be developed with this limitation in mind. 
1574,3,We recommend that web-log analysis should be an integral part of online decision aid development and analysis.
1575,4,"Comparison of Trial Participants and Open Access Users of a Web-Based Physical Activity Intervention Regarding Adherence, Attrition, and Repeated Participation"
1576,0,Web-based interventions are popular for promoting healthy lifestyles such as physical activity. 
1577,0,"However, little is known about user characteristics, adherence, attrition, and predictors of repeated participation on open access physical activity websites."
1578,1,Data routinely recorded in the Active-online user database were used. 
1579,1,"Adherence was defined as: the number of pages viewed, the proportion of visits during which a tailored module was begun, the proportion of visits during which tailored feedback was received, and the time spent in the tailored modules. "
1580,1,Adherence was analyzed according to six one-year periods (2003-2009) and according to the context (trial or open access) based on first visits and longest visits. 
1581,1,Attrition and predictors of repeated participation were compared between trial participants and open access users.
1582,2,"The number of recorded visits per year on Active-online decreased from 42,626 in 2003-2004 to 8343 in 2008-2009 (each of six one-year time periods ran from April 23 to April 22 of the following year). "
1583,2,The mean age of users was between 38.4 and 43.1 years in all time periods and both contexts. 
1584,2,The proportion of women increased from 49.5% in 2003-2004 to 61.3% in 2008-2009 (P<.001). 
1585,2,There were differences but no consistent time trends in adherence to Active-online. 
1586,2,"The mean age of trial participants was 43.1 years, and 74.9% were women. "
1587,2,"Comparing contexts, adherence was highest for registered open access users. "
1588,2,"For open access users, adherence was similar during the first and the longest visits; for trial participants, adherence was lower during the first visits and higher during the longest visits. "
1589,2,"Of registered open access users and trial participants, 25.8% and 67.3% respectively visited Active-online repeatedly (P<.001). "
1590,2,"Predictors of repeated use were male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.38) and increasing age category in registered open access users, and age 46-60 versus < 30 years (OR = 3.04, 95% Cl = 1.25-7.38) and Swiss nationality (ORnonSwiss = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.41-1.00) in trial participants. "
1591,2,"Despite reminder emails, attrition was much higher in registered open access users compared with trial participants, with a median lifetime website usage of 0 days in open access users and 290 days in trial participants."
1592,3,"Adherence, patterns of use, attrition, and repeated participation differed between trial participants and open access users. "
1593,3,Reminder emails to encourage repeated participation were effective for trial participants but not for registered open access users. 
1594,3,These issues are important when interpreting results of randomized controlled effectiveness trials.
1595,4,Age-Sensitive Design of Online Health Information: Comparative Usability Study
1596,0,Older adults' health maintenance may be enhanced by having access to online health information. 
1597,0,"However, usability issues may prevent older adults from easily accessing such information. "
1598,0,"Prior research has shown that aging is associated with a unique pattern of cognitive changes, and knowledge of these changes may be used in the design of health websites for older adults."
1599,1,"Fifty younger adults (aged 18-23) and 50 older adults (aged 60-80) navigated a health information website, which was organized hierarchically or used tags/keywords, to find answers to health-related questions while their performance was tracked. "
1600,1,We hypothesized that older adults would perform better in the tag-based health information website because it placed greater demands oil abilities that remain intact with aging (verbal ability and vocabulary).
1601,2,The pattern of age-related differences in computer use was consistent with prior research with older adults. 
1602,2,"We found that older adults had been using computers for less time (F-1,F-98=10.6, P=.002) and used them less often (F-1,F-98=11.3, P=.001) than younger adults. "
1603,2,"Also consistent with the cognitive aging literature, younger adults had greater spatial visualization and orientation abilities (F-1,F-98=34.6, P<.001 and F-1,F-98=6.8, P=.01) and a larger memory span (F-1,F-98=5.7, P=.02) than older adults, but older adults had greater vocabulary (F-1.98=11.4, P=-.001). "
1604,2,"Older adults also took significantly more medications than younger adults (F-1,F-98=57.7, P<.001). "
1605,2,"in the information search task, older adults performed worse than younger adults (F-1.96=18.0, P<.001). "
1606,2,"However, there was a significant age x condition interaction indicating that while younger adults outperformed older adults in the hierarchical condition (F-1,F-96=25.2, P<.001), there were no significant age-related differences in the tag-based condition, indicating that older adults performed as well as younger adults in this condition."
1607,3,Access to online health information is increasing in popularity and can lead to a more informed health consumer. 
1608,3,"However, usability barriers may differentially affect older adults. "
1609,3,The results of the current study suggest that the design of health information websites that take into account age-related changes in cognition can enhance older adults' access to such information.
1610,1,"Based on Java, and using the Web Ontology Language and Resource Description Framework for handling community data and oral medicine knowledge, SOMWeb was developed using a user-centered and iterative approach. "
1611,1,"For studying the work practices and evaluating the system, a mixed-method approach of interviews, observations, and a questionnaire was used."
1612,2,"By May 2008, there were 90 registered users of SOMWeb, 93 cases had been added, and 18 meetings had utilized the system. "
1613,2,"The introduction of SOMWeb has improved the structure of meetings and their discussions, and a tenfold increase in the number of participants has been observed. "
1614,2,"Users submit cases to seek advice on diagnosis or treatment, to show an unusual case, or to create discussion. "
1615,2,"Identified barriers to submitting cases are lack of time, concern about whether the case is interesting enough, and showing gaps in one's own knowledge. "
1616,2,Three levels of member participation are discernable: a core group that contributes most cases and most meeting feedback; an active group that participates often but only sometimes contribute cases and feedback; and a large peripheral group that seldom or never contribute cases or feedback.
1617,3,SOM Web is beneficial for individual clinicians as well as for the SOMNet community. 
1618,3,The system provides an opportunity for its members to share both high quality clinical practice knowledge and external evidence related to complex oral medicine cases. 
1619,3,The foundation in Semantic Web technologies enables formalization and structuring of case data that can be used for further reasoning and research. 
1620,3,"Main success factors are the long history of collaboration between different disciplines, the user-centered development approach, the existence of a ""champion"" within the field, and nontechnical community aspects already being in place."
1621,4,Reliability of Internet- versus telephone-administered questionnaires in a diverse sample of smokers
1622,0,Smoking is more prevalent among lower-income individuals and certain racial/ethnic minorities. 
1623,0,Addressing tobacco cessation among diverse populations is an urgent public health priority. 
1624,0,"As Internet use continues to rise among all segments of the US population, Web-based interventions have enormous potential to reach priority populations. "
1625,0,Conducting Web-based smoking cessation research in priority populations requires psychometrically sound measurement instruments. 
1626,0,"To date, only one published study has examined the psychometric properties of Internet-administered measures commonly used in Web-based cessation trials. "
1627,0,"However, the sample was homogeneous with regard to race/ethnicity and income. "
1628,0,We sought to replicate and extend these findings in a more diverse sample of smokers.
1629,1,Participants were enrolled in a randomized trial of the efficacy of an Internet smoking cessation program between June 2005 and September 2006. 
1630,1,"Following a baseline telephone assessment and randomization into the parent trial, participants were recruited to the reliability substudy. "
1631,1,"In phase I of recruitment, all participants in the parent trial were recruited to the substudy; in phase II, all consecutive racial/ethnic minority participants in the parent trial were recruited. "
1632,1,Race and ethnicity were assessed via self-report using two standard items from the US Office of Management and Budget. 
1633,1,An email was sent 2 days after the telephone assessment with a link to the Internet survey. 
1634,1,"Measures examined were quit methods, perceived stress, depression, social support, smoking temptations, alcohol use, perceived health status, and income. "
1635,1,"Internal consistency and test-retest reliability of Internet- versus telephone-administered measures were examined within four strata defined by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, racial/ethnic minority) and annual household income (US $40,000 or less, more than $40,000)."
1636,2,"Of the 442 individuals invited, 319 participated (72% response rate): 52.4% were non-Hispanic White, 22.9% Black, 11.6% Hispanic, 7.8% Asian, 4.4% American Indian / Alaska Native, and 1 % Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander. "
1637,2,"About half (49.4%) reported an annual household income of US $40,000 or less, and 25.7% had a high school degree or less. "
1638,2,"Test-retest reliability was satisfactory to excellent across all strata for the majority of measures examined: 9 of 12 continuous variables had intraclass correlation coefficients >= 0.70, and 10 of 18 binary variables and both ordinal variables had kappa coefficients >= 0.70. "
1639,2,Test-retest reliability of several quit methods varied across strata.
1640,3,Race/ethnicity and income do not affect the psychometric properties of most Internet-administered measures examined. 
1641,3,This knowledge adds to the confidence of conducting Web-based smoking cessation research and strengthens the scientific rigor of collecting information via the Internet on racial/ethnic minority and low-income subgroups.
1642,1,A Web-based survey instrument was designed and administered to 2768 members of the target audience. 
1643,1,Benefit expectations were analyzed for their relationship to (1) the respondents' willingness to participate in the CoP and (2) their involvement in funded research. 
1644,1,Two raters coded the respondents' answers regarding expected benefits using a 14-category coding scheme (Kappa = 0.834).
1645,2,The 256 respondents (11.1% response rate) preferred electronic resources over traditional print material to satisfy their information needs. 
1646,2,"The most frequently expected benefits from participation in the CoP were general information (85% of respondents), peer networking (31.1%), and identification of potential collaborators and/or research opportunities (23.2%)."
1647,3,The competitive social-information environment in which CoPs are embedded presents both threats to sustainability and opportunities for greater integration and impact. 
1648,3,"CoP planners seeking to support the development of emerging biomedical science disciplines should blend information resources, social search and filtering, and visibility mechanisms to provide a portfolio of social and information benefits. "
1649,3,Assessing benefit expectations and alternatives provides useful information for CoP planners seeking to prioritize community infrastructure development and encourage participation.
1650,4,Self-Reported Differences in Empowerment Between Lurkers and Posters in Online Patient Support Groups
1651,0,Patients who visit online support groups benefit in various ways. 
1652,0,"Results of our earlier study indicated that participation in online support groups had a profound effect on the participants' feelings of ""being empowered."" However, most studies of online patient support groups have focused on the members of these groups who actively contribute by sending postings (posters). "
1653,0,"Thus far, little is known about the impact for ""lurkers"" (ie, those who do not actively participate by sending postings)."
1654,1,"We searched the Internet with the search engine Google to identify all Dutch online support groups for patients with breast cancer, fibromyalgia, and arthritis. "
1655,1,Invitations to complete an online survey were sent out by the owners of 19 groups. 
1656,1,"In the online questionnaire, we asked questions about demographic and health characteristics, use of and satisfaction with the online support group, empowering processes, and empowering outcomes. "
1657,1,"The online questionnaire was completed by 528 individuals, of which 109 (21%) identified themselves as lurkers."
1658,0,Accurate assessment of the difficulty of consumer health texts is a prerequisite for improving readability. 
1659,0,"General purpose readability formulas based primarily on word length are not well suited for the health domain, where short technical terms may be unfamiliar to consumers. "
1660,0,"To address this need, we previously developed a regression model for predicting ""average familiarity"" with consumer health vocabulary (CHV) terms."
1661,1,Survey instruments for assessing surface-level familiarity (45 items) and concept-level familiarity (15 items) were developed. 
1662,1,"All participants also completed a demographic survey and a standardized health literacy assessment, S-TOFHLA."
1663,2,"Based on surveys completed by 52 consumers, linear regression suggests that predicted CHV term familiarity is a statistically significantly predictor (P < .001) of participants' surface-level and concept-level familiarity performance. "
1664,2,Health literacy was a statistically significant predictor of surface-level familiarity scores (P < .001); its effect on concept-level familiarity scores warrants further investigation (P = 0.06). 
1665,2,Educational level was not a significant predictor of either type of familiarity. 
1666,2,"Participant scores indicated that conceptualization lagged behind recognition, especially for terms predicted as ""likely to be familiar"" (P = .006)."
1667,3,This exploratory study suggests that the CHV term familiarity model is predictive of consumer recognition and understanding of terms in the health domain. 
1668,3,"Potential uses of such a model include readability formulas tailored to the consumer health domain and tools to ""translate"" professional medical documents into text that is more accessible to consumers. "
1669,3,The study also highlights the usefulness of distinguishing between surface-level term familiarity and deeper concept understanding and presents one method for assessing familiarity at each level.
1670,1,This study was a systematic review of PDA usage surveys. 
1671,1,Surveys were identified as part of an ongoing systematic review on the use of handheld devices. 
1672,1,Reports from eight databases covering both biomedical sciences and engineering (1993-2006) were screened against distinct eligibility criteria. 
1673,1,Data from included surveys were extracted and verified in a standardized way and were assessed descriptively.
1674,2,"We identified 23 relevant surveys, 15 of which were derived from peer-reviewed journals. "
1675,2,This cohort of surveys was published between 2000 and 2005. 
1676,2,"Overall, since 1999, there is clear evidence of an increasing trend in PDA use. "
1677,2,"The current overall adoption rate for individual professional use ranges between 45% and 85%, indicating high but somewhat variable adoption, primarily among physicians."
1678,3,Younger physicians and residents and those working in large and hospital-based practices are more likely to use a PDA. 
1679,3,The adoption rate is now at its highest rate of increase according to a commonly accepted diffusion of innovations model. 
1680,3,A common problem with the evaluation of information technology is that use frequently precedes research. 
1681,3,"This is the case here, in which PDA adoption rates are already high and projections are for rapid growth in the short term. "
1682,3,"In general, it appears that professional PDA use in health care settings involves more administrative and organizational tasks than those related to patient care, perhaps signaling where the growth in adoption is most likely to occur. "
1683,3,"We conclude that physicians are likely accustomed to using a PDA, and, therefore, technology expertise will probably not be a barrier to implementing PDA applications. "
1684,3,"However, there is an urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of specific tasks using handheld technology to inform those developing and those using PDA applications."
1685,4,Cancer patients self-reported attitudes about the Internet
1686,0,"Increasing numbers of cancer patients are using the Internet, but little is known about their attitudes toward online health care."
1687,1,This was a substudy of 41 persons with cancer who used the Internet for health care information and support and who completed the Attitudes Toward Online Health Care (ATOHC) survey.
1688,2,"The majority of study participants were married, held graduate degrees, and had high incomes. "
1689,2,"Using a five-point Likert scale, means for the five dimensions of the ATOHC survey were as follows: community and news 3.22 (SD = 1.01), outcomes 3.20 (SD = 1.08), trusted information and advice 2.73 (SD = 0.66), self-efficacy in evaluating information and intention 3.46 (SD = 0.65), and disclosure 3.15 (SD = 1.06). "
1690,2,"The average response fell between ""About half the time"" and ""Usually."" Favorite websites for content were Medscape and WebMD, while favorite sites for support were WebMD and Mediconsult."
1691,3,"Respondents were generally eager to obtain and offer cancer information and support online, but they were skeptical of unknown sources. "
1692,3,They were comfortable both giving and receiving information and support. 
1693,3,Respondents were interested in the experiences of other patients and benefited by their direct and indirect interactions with them. 
1694,3,Respondents felt that they coped better with their illness and experienced less uncertainty and anxiety as a result of their online experiences. 
1695,3,"They reported a certain level of trust, primarily for established reputable sources of information, and they were confident in their ability to evaluate the information, including research reports. "
1696,3,"In addition, cancer patients displayed a healthy skepticism when presented with the option of divulging their personal health information; however, they were willing to provide personal details if, as a result, a website provided them with individualized information."
1697,4,Improvement of the educational process by computer-based visualization of procedures: Randomized controlled trial
1698,0,"Before any invasive procedure, physicians have a legal obligation to inform patients. "
1699,0,"Traditionally, this involves a discussion with a physician, supplemented by written leaflet information directed at the specific procedure."
1700,1,"Prospective, randomized trial with 56 participants allocated in two different groups: Visualization Group (standardized information supported by a tool for displaying two-dimensional pictures to explain medical facts as well as informative leaflet) or Control Group (standardized information and informative leaflet only). "
1701,1,"Detailed information was given about the indication, the probable complications and the details of the forthcoming procedures (coronary catheters or endoscopy procedures). "
1702,1,All participants had to reach a Karnofsky Score of 70 points and be able to understand German or English. 
1703,1,"Main outcome measures were patient's satisfaction with physician-patient conversation, patient's acquired knowledge and duration of the intervention as described above."
1704,2,Patients of the Visualization Group were more satisfied with the conversation and had higher knowledge scores after the conversation. 
1705,2,A Mann-Whitney-U-Test between the two groups showed that these differences in satisfaction (P<0.001) and knowledge (P=<0.006) were statistically significant. 
1706,2,"Length of time needed for the conversation was slightly higher in the Visualization Group, but this difference was not statistically significant (25 versus 23 min; P= 0.441). "
1707,2,No differences could be found due to differing age or educational level in the results of the Visualization and the Control Group.
1708,3,Using computerized visualization increased the satisfaction and knowledge of the patients. 
1709,3,The presentation of the visualized information in the Visualization Group did not demand significantly more time than the standard conversation in the Control Group.
1710,4,Using claims data to examine patients using practice-based Internet communication: Is there a clinical digital divide? art. no. e1
1711,0,"Practice-based Internet communication allows patients to obtain health information, ask questions, and submit requests through a personalized Web site While such online tools also bring great promise for. "
1712,0,"educating patients with the goal of fostering behavior change, it is important to examine how individuals currently using such services differ from those who do not."
1713,1,"Patient claims data generated during clinical encounters from January 1999 through May 2000 were examined to measure the relationship between patient demographics, frequency of visits, specific acute diagnoses, and specific chronic diagnoses and the use of online communication with the practice."
1714,2,Ten percent of patients. 
1715,2,and 13.2% Of patients 18 years or older. 
1716,2,used the practice Web site. 
1717,2,"There were differences in use of the practice Web site by age and insurance status, but not by gender. "
1718,2,Use of the practice Web site was similar or higher among patients having a diagnosis for a variety of acute and chronic conditions compared to those not having such a diagnosis. 
1719,2,Patients with more clinic visits were more likely to use the Web-based service.
1720,3,"Patients using practice-based Internet communication and having significant health risks can be identified through the use of administrative data, presenting an opportunity to test online educational efforts to improve health."
1721,4,Reasons for Consulting a Doctor on the Internet: Web Survey of Users of an Ask the Doctor Service
1722,0,In 1998 the Swedish noncommercial public health service Infomedica opened an Ask the Doctor service on its Internet portal. 
1723,0,"At no charge, anyone with Internet access can use this service to ask questions about personal health-related and disease-related matters."
1724,1,"Between November 1, 2001, and January 31, 2002 a Web survey of the 3622 Ask the Doctor service users, 1036 men (29%) and 2586 (71%) women, was conducted. "
1725,1,We excluded 186 queries from users. 
1726,1,"The results are based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the answers to the question ""Why did you choose to ask a question at Infomedica's 'Ask the Doctor' service?"""
1727,2,1223 surveys were completed (response rate 34%). 
1728,2,Of the participants in the survey 322 (26%) were male and 901 (74%) female. 
1729,2,"As major reasons for choosing to consult previously-unknown doctors on the Internet participants indicated: convenience (52%), anonymity (36%), ""doctors too busy"" (21%), difficult to find time to visit a doctor (16%), difficulty to get an appointment (13%), feeling uncomfortable when seeing a doctor (9%), and not being able to afford a doctors' visit (3%). "
1730,2,"Further motives elicited through a qualitative analysis of free-text answers were: seeking a second opinion, discontent with previous doctors and a wish for a primary evaluation of a medical problem, asking embarrassing or sensitive questions, seeking information on behalf of relatives, preferring written communication, and (from responses by expatriates, travelers, and others) living far away from regular health care."
1731,3,"We found that an Internet based Ask the Doctor service is primarily consulted because it is convenient, but it may also be of value for individuals with needs that regular health care services have not been able to meet."
1732,4,Towards ethical guidelines for dealing with unsolicited patient emails and giving teleadvice in the absence of a pre-existing patient-physician relationship - systematic review and expert survey
1733,0,Many health information providers on the Internet and doctors with email accounts are confronted with the phenomenon of receiving unsolicited emails from patients asking for medical advice. 
1734,0,"Also, a growing number of websites offer ""ask-the-doctor"" services, where patients can ask questions to health professionals via email or other means of telecommunication. "
1735,0,"It is unclear whether these types of interactions constitute medical practice, and whether physicians have the ethical obligation to respond to unsolicited patient emails."
1736,1,"Systematic review of the literature, professional, and ethical codes; and consultation with experts."
1737,2,Two different types of patient-physician encounters have to be distinguished. 
1738,2,"""Traditional"" clinical encounters or telemedicine applications are called ""Type B"" interactions here (Bona fide relationship). "
1739,2,"In comparison, online interactions lack many of the characteristics of bona fide interactions; most notably there is no pre-existing relationship and the information available to the physician is limited if, for example, a physician responds to the email of a patient who he has never seen before. "
1740,2,"I call these ""Type A"" consultations (Absence of pre-existing patient-physician relationship). "
1741,2,"While guidelines for Type B interactions on the Internet exist (Kane, 1998), this is not the case for Type A interactions. "
1742,2,"The following principles are suggested: Physicians responding to patients' requests on the Internet should act within the limitations of telecommunication services and keep the global nature of the Internet in mind; not every aspect of medicine requires face-to-face communication; requests for help, including unsolicited patient questions, should not be ignored, but dealt with in some appropriate manner; informed consent requires fair and honest labeling; health professionals and information providers must maintain confidentiality; health professionals should define internal procedures and perform quality control measures."
1743,3,Different media are appropriate at each point on the continuum between dispensing general health information and handling patient problems that would require the practice of medicine to solve. 
1744,3,"For example, email is a sufficiently capable medium for giving out general health information, while diagnosis and treatment usually requires at least advanced telemedical technology. "
1745,3,"Patients have to be educated that it is unethical to diagnose and treat over the Internet in the absence of a pre-existing patient-physician relationship, and if the interaction is limited to a single email. "
1746,3,More research is needed to establish more evidence regarding situations in which teleadvice is beneficial and efficient.
1747,4,Effectiveness of Computer-Tailored Health Communication in Increasing Physical Activity in People With or at Risk of Long-Term Conditions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1748,0,Regular physical activity (PA) is beneficial for enhancing and sustaining both physical and mental well-being as well as for the management of preexisting conditions. 
1749,0,Computer-tailored health communication (CTHC) has been shown to be effective in increasing PA and many other health behavior changes in the general population. 
1750,0,"However, individuals with or at risk of long-term conditions face unique barriers that may limit the applicability of CTHC interventions to this population. "
1751,0,"Few studies have focused on this cohort, providing limited evidence for the effectiveness of CTHC in promoting PA."
1752,1,A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the effect of CTHC in increasing PA in people with or at risk of long-term conditions. 
1753,1,Hedges g was used to calculate the mean effect size. 
1754,1,The total effect size was pooled and weighted using inverse variance. 
1755,1,"When possible, potential moderator variables were synthesized, and their effectiveness was evaluated by subgroups analysis with Q test for between-group heterogeneity Q(b). "
1756,1,"Potential moderator variables included behavior change theories and models providing the fundamental logic for CTHC design, behavior change techniques and tailoring strategies to compose messages, and computer algorithms to achieve tailoring. "
1757,1,"Several methods were used to examine potential publication bias in the results, including the funnel plot, Egger test, Begg test, fail-safe N test, and trim-and-fill method."
1758,2,"In total, 24 studies were included in the systematic review for qualitative analysis and 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. "
1759,2,Significant small to medium effect size values were found when comparing CTHC to general health information (Hedges g=0.16; P<.001) and to no information sent to participants (Hedges g=0.29; P<.001). 
1760,2,"Half of the included studies had a low to moderate risk of bias, and the remaining studies had a moderate to high risk of bias. "
1761,2,"Although the results of the meta-analysis indicated no evidence of publication bias, caution is required when drawing definitive conclusions due to the limited number of studies in each subgroup (N <= 10). "
1762,2,"Message-tailoring strategies, implementation strategies, behavior change theories and models, and behavior change techniques were synthesized from the 24 studies. "
1763,2,No strong evidence was found from subgroup analyses on the effectiveness of using particular behavior change theories and models or from using particular message-tailoring and implementation strategies.
1764,3,"This study demonstrates that CTHC is effective in increasing PA for people with or at risk of long-term conditions, with significant small to medium effects compared with general health information or no information. "
1765,3,Further studies are needed to guide design decisions for maximizing the effectiveness of CTHC.
1766,4,Cost-Effectiveness of Mobile Health-Based Integrated Care for Atrial Fibrillation: Model Development and Data Analysis
1767,0,Mobile health (mHealth) technology has great potential for addressing the epidemic of chronic noncommunicable diseases (CNCDs) by assisting health providers (HPs) with managing these diseases. 
1768,0,"However, there is currently limited evidence regarding the acceptance of mHealth among HPs, which is a key prerequisite for harnessing this potential."
1769,1,"A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library (via Ovid) for studies that assessed the perceptions and experiences of HPs regarding the barriers to and facilitators of mHealth use for CNCDs. "
1770,1,Qualitative studies and mixed methods studies involving qualitative methods published in English were included. 
1771,1,Data synthesis and interpretation were performed using a thematic synthesis approach.
1772,2,"A total of 18,242 studies were identified, of which 24 (0.13%) met the inclusion criteria. "
1773,2,"Overall, 6 themes related to facilitators were identified, namely empowering patient self-management, increasing efficiency, improving access to care, increasing the quality of care, improving satisfaction, and improving the usability of the internet and mobile software. "
1774,2,"Furthermore, 8 themes related to barriers were identified, namely limitation due to digital literacy, personal habits, or health problems; concern about additional burden; uncertainty around the value of mHealth technology; fear of medicolegal risks; lack of comfortable design and experience; lack of resources and incentives; lack of policy guidance and regulation; and worrisome side effects resulting from the use of mHealth."
1775,3,This study contributes to the understanding of the beneficial factors of and obstacles to mHealth adoption by HPs for CNCDs. 
1776,3,The findings of this study may provide significant insights for health care workers and policy makers who seek ways to improve the adoption of mHealth by HPs for CNCDs.
1777,4,Cyber Hygiene Methodology for Raising Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Awareness in Health Care Organizations: Concept Study
1778,0,"Cyber threats are increasing across all business sectors, with health care being a prominent domain. "
1779,0,"In response to the ever-increasing threats, health care organizations (HOs) are enhancing the technical measures with the use of cybersecurity controls and other advanced solutions for further protection. "
1780,0,"Despite the need for technical controls, humans are evidently the weakest link in the cybersecurity posture of HOs. "
1781,0,This suggests that addressing the human aspects of cybersecurity is a key step toward managing cyber-physical risks. 
1782,0,"In practice, HOs are required to apply general cybersecurity and data privacy guidelines that focus on human factors. "
1783,0,"However, there is limited literature on the methodologies and procedures that can assist in successfully mapping these guidelines to specific controls (interventions), including awareness activities and training programs, with a measurable impact on personnel. "
1784,0,"To this end, tools and structured methodologies for assisting higher management in selecting the minimum number of required controls that will be most effective on the health care workforce are highly desirable."
1785,1,"The CH methodology relied on a cross-sectional, exploratory survey study followed by a proposed risk-based survey data analysis approach. "
1786,1,"First, survey data were collected from 4 different employee groups across 3 European HOs, covering 7 categories of cybersecurity and data privacy risks. "
1787,1,"Next, survey data were transcribed and fitted into a proposed risk-based approach matrix that translated risk levels to strategies for managing the risks."
1788,2,A list of human-centric controls and implementation levels was created. 
1789,2,"These controls were associated with risk categories, mapped to risk strategies for managing the risks related to all employee groups. "
1790,2,Our mapping empowered the computation and subsequent recommendation of subsets of human-centric controls to implement the identified strategy for managing the overall risk of the HOs. 
1791,2,An indicative example demonstrated the application of the CH methodology in a simple scenario. 
1792,2,"Finally, by applying the CH methodology in the health care sector, we obtained results in the form of risk markings; identified strategies to manage the risks; and recommended controls for each of the 3 HOs, each employee group, and each risk category."
1793,3,The proposed CH methodology improves the CH perception and behavior of personnel in the health care sector and provides risk strategies together with a list of recommended human-centric controls for managing a wide range of cybersecurity and data privacy risks related to health care employees.
1794,4,Adaptation and Implementation of a Shared Decision-Making Tool From One Health Context to Another: Partnership Approach Using Mixed Methods
1795,0,Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of pain and disability. 
1796,0,"Knee osteoarthritis accounts for nearly four-fifths of the burden of osteoarthritis internationally, and 10% of adults in the United Kingdom have the condition. "
1797,0,Shared decision-making (SDM) supports patients to make more informed choices about treatment and care while reducing inequities in access to treatment. 
1798,0,We evaluated the experience of a team adapting an SDM tool for knee osteoarthritis and the tool's implementation potential within a local clinical commissioning group (CCG) area in southwest England. 
1799,0,The tool aims to prepare patients and clinicians for SDM by providing evidence-based information about treatment options relevant to disease stage.
1800,1,A partnership approach using mixed methods was used to respond to recruitment challenges and ensure that study aims could be addressed within time restrictions. 
1801,1,A web-based survey was used to obtain clinicians' feedback on experiences of using the SDM tool. 
1802,1,Qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone or video call with a sample of stakeholders involved in adapting and implementing the tool in the local CCG area. 
1803,1,Survey findings were summarized as frequencies and percentages. 
1804,1,"Content analysis was conducted on qualitative data using framework analysis, and data were mapped directly to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)."
1805,2,"Overall, 23 clinicians completed the survey, including first-contact physiotherapists (11/23, 48%), physiotherapists (7/23, 30%), specialist physiotherapists (4/23, 17%), and a general practitioner (1/23, 4%). "
1806,2,"Eight stakeholders involved in commissioning, adapting, and implementing the SDM tool were interviewed. "
1807,2,"Participants described barriers and facilitators to the adaptation, implementation, and use of the tool. "
1808,2,"Barriers included a lack of organizational culture that supported and resourced SDM, lack of clinician buy-in and awareness of the tool, challenges with accessibility and usability, and lack of adaptation for underserved communities. "
1809,2,"Facilitators included the influence of clinical leaders' belief that SDM tools can improve patient outcomes and National Health Service resource use, clinicians' positive experiences of using the tool, and improving awareness of the tool. "
1810,2,Themes were mapped to 13 of the 14 TDF domains. 
1811,2,"Usability issues were described, which did not map to the TDF domains."
1812,3,This study highlights barriers and facilitators to adapting and implementing tools from one health context to another. 
1813,3,"We recommend that tools selected for adaptation should have a strong evidence base, including evidence of effectiveness and acceptability in the original context. "
1814,3,Legal advice should be sought regarding intellectual property early in the project. 
1815,3,Existing guidance for developing and adapting interventions should be used. 
1816,3,Co-design methods should be applied to improve adapted tools' accessibility and acceptability.
1817,4,"Comparing Message-Based Psychotherapy to Once-Weekly, Video-Based Psychotherapy for Moderate Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial"
1818,0,"Despite the high prevalence of major depressive disorder and the related societal burden, access to effective traditional face-to-face or video-based psychotherapy is a challenge. "
1819,0,An alternative that offers mental health care in a flexible setting is asynchronous messaging therapy. 
1820,0,"To date, no study has evaluated its efficacy and acceptability in a randomized controlled trial for depression."
1821,1,"In this 2-armed randomized controlled trial, individuals (N=83) with depressive symptomatology (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 >= 10) were recruited on the internet and randomly assigned to either a message-based intervention group (n=46) or a once-weekly video-based intervention group (n=37). "
1822,1,Patients in the message-based treatment condition exchanged asynchronous messages with their therapist following an agreed-upon schedule. 
1823,1,Patients in the video-based treatment condition met with their therapist once each week for a 45-minute video teletherapy session. 
1824,1,"Self-report data for depression, anxiety, and functional impairment were collected at pretreatment, weekly during treatment, at posttreatment, and at a 6-month follow-up. "
1825,1,Self-reported treatment expectancy and credibility for the assigned intervention were assessed at pretreatment and therapeutic alliance at posttreatment.
1826,2,"Findings from multilevel modeling indicated significant, medium-to-large improvements in depression (d=1.04; 95% CI 0.60-1.46), anxiety (d=0.61; 95% CI 0.22-0.99), and functional impairment (d=0.66; 95% CI 0.27-1.05) for patients in the message-based treatment condition. "
1827,2,"Changes in depression (d=0.11; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.66), anxiety (d=-0.01; 95% CI -0.56 to 0.53), and functional impairment (d=0.25; 95% CI -0.30 to 0.80) in the message-based treatment condition were noninferior to those in the video-based treatment condition. "
1828,2,"There were no significant differences in treatment credibility (d=-0.09; 95% CI -0.64 to 0.45), therapeutic alliance (d=-0.15; 95% CI -0.75 to 0.44), or engagement (d=0.24; 95% CI -0.20 to 0.67) between the 2 treatment conditions."
1829,3,Message-based psychotherapy could present an effective and accessible alternative treatment modality for patients who might not be able to engage in traditional scheduled services such as face-to-face or video-based psychotherapy.
1830,4,Cultural Implications Regarding Privacy in Digital Contact Tracing Algorithms: Method Development and Empirical Ethics Analysis of a German and a Japanese Approach to Contact Tracing
1831,0,Digital contact tracing algorithms (DCTAs) have emerged as a means of supporting pandemic containment strategies and protecting populations from the adverse effects of COVID-19. 
1832,0,"However, the impact of DCTAs on users' privacy and autonomy has been heavily debated. "
1833,0,"Although privacy is often viewed as the ability to control access to information, recent approaches consider it as a norm that structures social life. "
1834,0,"In this regard, cultural factors are crucial in evaluating the appropriateness of information flows in DCTAs. "
1835,0,"Hence, an important part of ethical evaluations of DCTAs is to develop an understanding of their information flow and their contextual situatedness to be able to adequately evaluate questions about privacy. "
1836,0,"However, only limited studies and conceptual approaches are currently available in this regard."
1837,1,We conducted a comparative qualitative case study of the algorithm of the Google Apple Exposure Notification Framework as exemplified in the German Corona Warn App and the Japanese approach of Computation of Infection Risk via Confidential Locational Entries (CIRCLE) method. 
1838,1,"The methodology was based on a postphenomenological perspective, combined with empirical investigations of the technological artifacts within their context of use. "
1839,1,An ethics of disclosure approach was used to focus on the social ontologies created by the algorithms and highlight their connection to the question about privacy.
1840,2,Both algorithms use the idea of representing a social encounter of 2 subjects. 
1841,2,These subjects gain significance in terms of risk against the background of a representation of their temporal and spatial properties. 
1842,2,"However, the comparative analysis the representation of spatiality is reduced to distance without any direction or orientation. "
1843,2,"However, the CIRCLE framework prioritizes spatiality over temporality. "
1844,2,"These different concepts and prioritizations can be seen to align with important cultural differences in considering basic concepts such as subject, time, and space in Eastern and Western thought."
1845,3,The differences noted in this study essentially lead to 2 different ethical questions about privacy that are raised against the respective backgrounds. 
1846,3,"These findings have important implications for the ethical evaluation of DCTAs, suggesting that a culture-sensitive assessment is required to ensure that technologies fit into their context and create less concern regarding their ethical acceptability. "
1847,3,"Methodologically, our study provides a basis for an intercultural approach to the ethics of disclosure, allowing for cross-cultural dialogue that can overcome mutual implicit biases and blind spots based on cultural differences."
1848,4,Effect of a Mobile App-Based Urinary Incontinence Self-Management Intervention Among Pregnant Women in China: Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial
1849,0,Urinary incontinence (UI) is a highly prevalent health concern commonly observed during and after pregnancy that can substantially impact women's physical and psychological well-being and quality of life. 
1850,0,"Owing to its numerous advantages, mobile health may be a promising solution; however, it is unclear whether the app-based intervention can effectively improve UI symptoms during and after pregnancy."
1851,1,Singleton pregnant women without incontinence before pregnancy who were aged >= 18 years and between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation were recruited from a tertiary public hospital in China and were randomly allocated (1:1) to either an experimental group (n=63) or a control group (n=63). 
1852,1,"The experimental group received the UIW app intervention and oral pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) instructions, whereas the control group received oral PFMT instructions alone. "
1853,1,Neither the participants nor the researchers were blinded to the intervention. 
1854,1,The primary outcome was UI severity. 
1855,1,"The secondary outcomes included quality of life, self-efficacy with PFMT, and knowledge of UI. "
1856,1,"All data were collected at baseline, 2 months after randomization, and 6 weeks post partum through electronic questionnaires or by checking the electronic medical record system. "
1857,1,Data analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle. 
1858,1,A linear mixed model was used to examine the intervention effect on primary and secondary outcomes.
1859,2,Participants in the experimental and control groups were comparable at baseline. 
1860,2,"Of the 126 overall participants, 117 (92.9%) and 103 (81.7%) women completed follow-up visits at 2 months after randomization and 6 weeks after delivery, respectively. "
1861,2,"A statistically significant difference in UI symptom severity was observed between the experimental group and control group (2 months after randomization: mean difference -2.86, 95% CI -4.09 to -1.64, P<.001; 6 weeks post partum: mean difference -2.68, 95% CI -3.87 to -1.49, P<.001). "
1862,2,"For the secondary outcomes, a statistically significant intervention effect on the quality of life, self-efficacy, and UI knowledge was found at the 2-month follow-up (all P<.05) and 6 weeks post partum (all P<.001)."
1863,3,"The app-based UI self-management intervention (UIW) effectively improved UI symptom severity, quality of life, self-efficacy with PFMT, and knowledge of UI during the late pregnancy and early postnatal periods. "
1864,3,Larger multicenter studies with a longer postpartum follow-up are required to further extend these findings.
1865,4,"A Transgender Chatbot (Amanda Selfie) to Create Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Demand Among Adolescents in Brazil: Assessment of Acceptability, Functionality, Usability, and Results"
1866,0,HIV incidence rates have increased in adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) and adolescent transgender women (ATGW). 
1867,0,"Thus, it is essential to promote access to HIV prevention, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), among these groups. "
1868,0,"Moreover, using artificial intelligence and online social platforms to create demand and access to health care services are essential tools for adolescents and youth."
1869,1,The chatbot Amanda Selfie integrates the demand creation strategies based on social networks (DCSSNs) of the PrEP1519 study. 
1870,1,She was conceived as a Black transgender woman and to function as a virtual peer educator. 
1871,1,"The development process occurred in 3 phases (conception, trial, and final version) and lasted 21 months. "
1872,1,A mixed methodology was used for the evaluations. 
1873,1,"Qualitative approaches, such as in-depth adolescent interviews, were used to analyze acceptability and usability, while quantitative methods were used to analyze the functionality and result of the demand creation for PrEP based on interactions with Amanda and information from health care services about using PrEP. "
1874,1,"To evaluate Amanda's result on the demand creation for PrEP, we analyzed sociodemographic profiles of adolescents who interacted at least once with her and developed a cascade model containing the number of people at various stages between the first interaction and initiation of PrEP (PrEP uptake). "
1875,1,These indicators were compared with other DCSs developed in the PrEP1519 study using chi-square tests and residual analysis (P=.05).
1876,2,"Amanda Selfie was well accepted as a peer educator, clearly and objectively communicating on topics such as gender identity, sexual experiences, HIV, and PrEP. "
1877,2,"The chatbot proved appropriate for answering questions in an agile and confidential manner, using the language used by AMSM and ATGW and with a greater sense of security and less judgment. "
1878,2,The interactions with Amanda Selfie combined with a health professional were well evaluated and improved the appointment scheduling. 
1879,2,"The chatbot interacted with most people (757/1239, 61.1%) reached by the DCSSNs. "
1880,2,"However, when compared with the other DCSSNs, Amanda was not efficient in identifying AMSM/ATGW (359/482, 74.5% vs 130/757, 17.2% of total interactions, respectively) and in PrEP uptake (90/359, 25.1% vs 19/130, 14.6%). "
1881,2,"The following profiles were associated (P<.001) with Amanda Selfie's demand creation, when compared with other DCS: ATGW and adolescents with higher levels of schooling and White skin color."
1882,3,"Using a chatbot to create PrEP demand among AMSM and ATGW was well accepted, especially for ATGW with higher levels of schooling. "
1883,3,"A complimentary dialog with a health professional increased PrEP uptake, although it remained lower than the results of the other DCSSNs."
1884,4,A Machine Learning Approach for the Prediction of Testicular Sperm Extraction in Nonobstructive Azoospermia: Algorithm Development and Validation Study
1885,0,Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) is an essential therapeutic tool for the management of male infertility. 
1886,0,"However, it is an invasive procedure with a success rate up to 50%. "
1887,0,"To date, no model based on clinical and laboratory parameters is sufficiently powerful to accurately predict the success of sperm retrieval in TESE."
1888,1,"We analyzed 201 patients who underwent TESE at Tenon Hospital (Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Sorbonne University, Paris), distributed in a retrospective training cohort of 175 patients (January 2012 to April 2021) and a prospective testing cohort (May 2021 to December 2021) of 26 patients. "
1889,1,"Preoperative data (according to the French standard exploration of male infertility, 16 variables) including urogenital history, hormonal data, genetic data, and TESE outcomes (representing the target variable) were collected. "
1890,1,A TESE was considered positive if we obtained sufficient spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. 
1891,1,"After preprocessing the raw data, 8 machine learning (ML) models were trained and optimized on the retrospective training cohort data set: The hyperparameter tuning was performed by random search. "
1892,1,"Finally, the prospective testing cohort data set was used for the model evaluation. "
1893,1,"The metrics used to evaluate and compare the models were the following: sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and accuracy. "
1894,1,"The importance of each variable in the model was assessed using the permutation feature importance technique, and the optimal number of patients to include in the study was assessed using the learning curve."
1895,2,"The ensemble models, based on decision trees, showed the best performance, especially the random forest model, which yielded the following results: AUC=0.90, sensitivity=100%, and specificity=69.2%. "
1896,2,"Furthermore, a study size of 120 patients seemed sufficient to properly exploit the preoperative data in the modeling process, since increasing the number of patients beyond 120 during model training did not bring any performance improvement. "
1897,2,"Furthermore, inhibin B and a history of varicoceles exhibited the highest predictive capacity."
1898,3,"An ML algorithm based on an appropriate approach can predict successful sperm retrieval in men with NOA undergoing TESE, with promising performance. "
1899,3,"However, although this study is consistent with the first step of this process, a subsequent formal prospective multicentric validation study should be undertaken before any clinical applications. "
1900,3,"As future work, we consider the use of recent and clinically relevant data sets (including seminal plasma biomarkers, especially noncoding RNAs, as markers of residual spermatogenesis in NOA patients) to improve our results even more."
1901,4,Provider Interaction With an Electronic Health Record Notification to Identify Eligible Patients for a Cluster Randomized Trial of Advance Care Planning in Primary Care: Secondary Analysis
1902,0,"Advance care planning (ACP) improves patient-provider communication and aligns care to patient values, preferences, and goals. "
1903,0,"Within a multisite Meta-network Learning and Research Center ACP study, one health system deployed an electronic health record (EHR) notification and algorithm to alert providers about patients potentially appropriate for ACP and the clinical study."
1904,1,"A secondary analysis assessed provider usage and their response to the notification (eg, acknowledge, dismiss, or engage patient in ACP conversation and refer patient to the clinical study). "
1905,1,We evaluated all patients identified by the EHR algorithm during the Meta-network Learning and Research Center ACP study. 
1906,1,Descriptive statistics compared patients referred to the study to those who were not referred to the study. 
1907,1,"Health care utilization, hospice referrals, and mortality as well as documentation and billing for ACP and related legal documents are reported. "
1908,1,"We evaluated associations between notifications with provider actions (ie, referral to study, ACP not documentation, and ACP billing). "
1909,1,Provider free-text comments in the notifications were summarized qualitatively. 
1910,1,Providers were surveyed on their satisfaction with the notification.
1911,2,"Among the 2877 patients identified by the EHR algorithm over 20 months, 17,047 unique notifications were presented to 45 providers in 6 clinics, who then referred 290 (10%) patients. "
1912,2,"Providers had a median of 269 (IQR 65-552) total notifications, and patients had a median of 4 (IQR 2-8). "
1913,2,"Patients with more (over 5) notifications were less likely to be referred to the study than those with fewer notifications (57/1092, 5.2% vs 233/1785, 13.1%; P<.001). "
1914,2,The most common free-text comment on the notification was lack of time. 
1915,2,Providers who referred patients to the study were more likely to document ACP and submit ACP billing codes (P<.001). 
1916,2,"In the survey, 11 providers would recommend the notification (n=7, 64%); however, the notification impacted clinical workflow (n=9, 82%) and was difficult to navigate (n=6, 55%)."
1917,3,An EHR notification can be implemented to remind providers to both perform ACP conversations and refer patients to a clinical study. 
1918,3,"There were diminishing returns after the fifth EHR notification where additional notifications did not lead to more trial referrals, ACP documentation, or ACP billing. "
1919,3,"Creation and optimization of EHR notifications for study referrals and ACP should consider the provider user, their workflow, and alert fatigue to improve implementation and adoption.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03577002; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03577002"
1920,4,Co-created Technological Solutions for Caregivers in Health Care: Systematic Review
1921,0,"Support interventions for caregivers can reduce their stress, possibly improving the quality of patients' care while reducing care costs. "
1922,0,"Technological solutions have been designed to cover their needs, but there are some challenges in making them truly functional for end users. "
1923,0,Co-design approaches present important opportunities for engaging diverse populations to help ensure that technological solutions are inclusive and accessible.
1924,1,"The literature review was conducted in the Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Scielo, and IEEE Xplore databases. "
1925,1,The inclusion criteria were studies written in English or Spanish and with a publication date until May 2021. 
1926,1,"The content had to specify that the caregivers actively participated in the co-creation process, which covered until the development phase of the technological solution (prototype). "
1927,1,"The level of evidence and the methodological quality were analyzed when possible, using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, version 2018, respectively."
1928,2,"In total, 410 papers were identified, and 11 met the eligibility criteria. "
1929,2,The most predominant articles were mixed methods studies and qualitative studies. 
1930,2,"The technology used in the analyzed articles were mobile or web applications (9 studies) and specific devices such as sensors, cameras, or alarm systems (2 studies) to support the health and social aspects of caregivers and improve their education in care. "
1931,2,"The most common patient profile was older people (7 studies); 6 studies used co-creation in the requirements phase, 6 studies detailed the design phase. "
1932,2,"In 9 studies, the prototype was iteratively refined in the development phase, and the validation phase was performed in 5 of the reviewed studies."
1933,3,"This systematic review suggests that existing co-created technological solutions in the field of health for caregivers are mostly mobile or web applications to support caregivers' social health and well-being and improve their health knowledge when delivering care to patients, especially older people. "
1934,3,"As for the co-creation process, caregivers are particularly involved during development and in the design. "
1935,3,The scarce literature found indicates that further research with higher methodological quality is needed.
1936,4,Applications of Federated Learning in Mobile Health: Scoping Review
1937,0,"The proliferation of mobile health (mHealth) applications is partly driven by the advancements in sensing and communication technologies, as well as the integration of artificial intelligence techniques. "
1938,0,"Data collected from mHealth applications, for example, on sensor devices carried by patients, can be mined and analyzed using artificial intelligence-based solutions to facilitate remote and (near) real-time decision-making in health care settings. "
1939,0,"However, such data often sit in data silos, and patients are often concerned about the privacy implications of sharing their raw data. "
1940,0,"Federated learning (FL) is a potential solution, as it allows multiple data owners to collaboratively train a machine learning model without requiring access to each other's raw data."
1941,1,We conducted a scoping review following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). 
1942,1,We searched 7 commonly used databases. 
1943,1,The included studies were analyzed and summarized to identify the possible real-world applications and associated challenges of using FL in mHealth settings.
1944,2,"A total of 1095 articles were retrieved during the database search, and 26 articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. "
1945,2,"The analysis of these articles revealed 2 main application areas for FL in mHealth, that is, remote monitoring and diagnostic and treatment support. "
1946,2,"More specifically, FL was found to be commonly used for monitoring self-care ability, health status, and disease progression, as well as in diagnosis and treatment support of diseases. "
1947,2,"The review also identified several challenges (eg, expensive communication, statistical heterogeneity, and system heterogeneity) and potential solutions (eg, compression schemes, model personalization, and active sampling)."
1948,3,This scoping review has highlighted the potential of FL as a privacy-preserving approach in mHealth applications and identified the technical limitations associated with its use. 
1949,3,"The challenges and opportunities outlined in this review can inform the research agenda for future studies in this field, to overcome these limitations and further advance the use of FL in mHealth."
1950,4,Sensory Overresponsivity and Symptoms Across the Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum: Web-Based Longitudinal Observational Study
1951,0,"Sensory overresponsivity (SOR) has emerged as a potential endophenotype in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but few studies have examined SOR in relation to the major symptom dimensions of OCD and to symptoms across the full obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom spectrum."
1952,1,We translated the SOR Scales into Spanish-a measure that assesses SOR across the 5 sensory modalities-and created a web-based version of the measure. 
1953,1,"A sample of 1454 adolescents and adults (mean age 23.84, SD 8.46 years) participated in the study, and 388 (26.69%) participants completed the survey twice (approximately 8 months apart). "
1954,1,"The survey also contained a web-based measure that assesses symptoms across the full OC spectrum: harm and checking, taboo obsessions, contamination or cleaning, symmetry and ordering, body dysmorphic, hoarding, hair-pulling, and skin-picking symptoms."
1955,2,"The psychometric properties of the SOR Scales were excellent, and the test-retest reliability was adequate. "
1956,2,All types of SOR were related to all major symptom dimensions of OCD and to all OC spectrum symptoms.
1957,3,SOR across the sensory modalities can be validly assessed using a web-based measure. 
1958,3,"SOR emerged as a pure transdiagnostic phenomenon in relation to symptoms across the OC spectrum, with no specific sensory modality being more strongly related to OC symptoms. "
1959,3,"SOR can shed much needed light on basic mechanisms that are important for the onset and maintenance of OC spectrum symptoms, and this study shows that large-scale web-based studies can aid in this endeavor. "
1960,3,Future studies should examine whether SOR precedes or emerges alongside OC symptoms.
1961,4,Evaluating the Efficacy of a Social Media-Based Intervention (Warna-Warni Waktu) to Improve Body Image Among Young Indonesian Women: Parallel Randomized Controlled Trial
1962,0,"Body dissatisfaction is a global issue, particularly among adolescent girls and young women. "
1963,0,"Effective body image interventions exist but face barriers to scaling up, particularly in lower-and middle-income countries, such as Indonesia, where a need exists."
1964,1,"We conducted a web-based, 2-arm randomized controlled trial among 2000 adolescent girls and young women, aged 15 to 19 years, recruited via telephone by an Indonesian research agency. "
1965,1,Block randomization (1:1 allocation) was performed. 
1966,1,Participants and researchers were not concealed from the randomized arm. 
1967,1,"Participants completed self-report assessments of trait body satisfaction (primary outcome) and the internalization of appearance ideals, mood, and skin shade dissatisfaction at baseline (before randomization), time 2 (1 day after the intervention [T2]), and time 3 (1 month after the intervention [T3]). "
1968,1,Participants also completed state body satisfaction and mood measures immediately before and after each video. 
1969,1,Data were evaluated using linear mixed models with an intent-to-treat analysis. 
1970,1,Intervention adherence was tracked. 
1971,1,Acceptability data were collected.
1972,2,There were 1847 participants. 
1973,2,"Relative to the control condition (n=923), the intervention group (n=924) showed reduced internalization of appearance ideals at T2 (F-1,F-1758=40.56, P<.001, partial eta(2)=0.022) and T3 (F-1,F-1782=54.03, P<.001, partial eta(2)=0.03) and reduced skin shade dissatisfaction at T2 (F-1,F-1744=8.05, P=.005, partial eta(2)=0.005). "
1974,2,"Trait body satisfaction improvements occurred in the intervention group at T3 (F-1,F- 1781=9.02, P=.005, partial eta(2)=0.005), which was completely mediated by the internalization change scores between baseline and T2 (indirect effect: beta=.03, 95% CI 0.017-0.041; direct effect: beta=.03, P=.13), consistent with the Tripartite Influence Model of body dissatisfaction. "
1975,2,Trait mood showed no significant effects. 
1976,2,Dependent sample t tests (2-tailed) found each video improved state body satisfaction and mood. 
1977,2,Cumulative analyses found significant and progressive improvements in pre-and poststate body satisfaction and mood. 
1978,2,Intervention adherence was good; participants watched an average of 5.2 (SD 1.66) videos. 
1979,2,"Acceptability scores were high for understandability, enjoyment, age appropriateness, usefulness, and likelihood to recommend."
1980,3,Warna-Warni Waktu is an effective eHealth intervention to reduce body dissatisfaction among Indonesian adolescent girls and young women. 
1981,3,"Although the effects were small, Warna-Warni Waktu is a scalable, cost-effective alternative to more intense interventions. "
1982,3,"Initially, dissemination through paid social media advertising will reach thousands of young Indonesian women."
1983,4,Data Provenance in Biomedical Research: Scoping Review
1984,0,"Data provenance refers to the origin, processing, and movement of data. "
1985,0,"Reliable and precise knowledge about data provenance has great potential to improve reproducibility as well as quality in biomedical research and, therefore, to foster good scientific practice. "
1986,0,"However, despite the increasing interest on data provenance technologies in the literature and their implementation in other disciplines, these technologies have not yet been widely adopted in biomedical research."
1987,1,"Following a methodological framework for scoping studies and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, articles were identified by searching the PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science databases and subsequently screened for eligibility. "
1988,1,We included original articles covering software-based provenance management for scientific research published between 2010 and 2021. 
1989,1,"A set of data items was defined along the following five axes: publication metadata, application scope, provenance aspects covered, data representation, and functionalities. "
1990,1,"The data items were extracted from the articles, stored in a charting spreadsheet, and summarized in tables and figures."
1991,2,We identified 44 original articles published between 2010 and 2021. 
1992,2,We found that the solutions described were heterogeneous along all axes. 
1993,2,"We also identified relationships among motivations for the use of provenance information, feature sets (capture, storage, retrieval, visualization, and analysis), and implementation details such as the data models and technologies used. "
1994,2,"The important gap that we identified is that only a few publications address the analysis of provenance data or use established provenance standards, such as PROV."
1995,3,"The heterogeneity of provenance methods, models, and implementations found in the literature points to the lack of a unified understanding of provenance concepts for biomedical data. "
1996,3,"Providing a common framework, a biomedical reference, and benchmarking data sets could foster the development of more comprehensive provenance solutions."
1997,4,The Longitudinal Impact of Social Media Use on UK Adolescents Mental Health: Longitudinal Observational Study
1998,0,Cross-sectional studies have found a relationship between social media use and depression and anxiety in young people. 
1999,0,"However, few longitudinal studies using representative data and mediation analysis have been conducted to understand the causal pathways of this relationship."
2000,1,"The sample included 3228 participants who were 10- to 15-year-olds from Understanding Society (2009-2019), a UK longitudinal household survey. "
2001,1,"The number of hours spent on social media was measured on a 5-point scale from ""none"" to ""7 or more hours"" at the ages of 12-13 years. "
2002,1,Self-esteem and social connectedness (number of friends and happiness with friendships) were measured at the ages of 13-14 years. 
2003,1,Mental health problems measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were assessed at the ages of 14-15 years. 
2004,1,Covariates included demographic and household variables. 
2005,1,Unadjusted and adjusted multilevel linear regression models were used to estimate the association between social media use and mental health. 
2006,1,We used path analysis with structural equation modeling to investigate the mediation pathways.
2007,2,"In adjusted analysis, there was a nonsignificant linear trend showing that more time spent on social media was related to poorer mental health 2 years later (n=2603, beta=.21, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.84; P=.52). "
2008,2,"In an unadjusted path analysis, 68% of the effect of social media use on mental health was mediated by self-esteem (indirect effect, n=2569, beta=.70, 95% CI 0.15-1.30; P=.02). "
2009,2,"This effect was attenuated in the adjusted analysis, and it was found that self-esteem was no longer a significant mediator (indirect effect, n=2316, beta=.24, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.66; P=.22). "
2010,2,We did not find evidence that the association between social media and mental health was mediated by social connectedness. 
2011,2,Similar results were found in imputed data.
2012,3,There was little evidence to suggest that more time spent on social media was associated with later mental health problems in UK adolescents. 
2013,3,This study shows the importance of longitudinal studies to examine this relationship and suggests that prevention strategies and interventions to improve mental health associated with social media use could consider the role of factors like self-esteem.
2014,4,Study Features and Response Compliance in Ecological Momentary Assessment Research in Borderline Personality Disorder: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
2015,0,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by frequent and intense moment-to-moment changes in affect, behavior, identity, and interpersonal relationships, which typically result in significant and negative deterioration of the person's overall functioning and well-being. "
2016,0,Measuring and characterizing the rapidly changing patterns of instability in BPD dysfunction as they occur in a person's daily life can be challenging. 
2017,0,"Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a method that can capture highly dynamic processes in psychopathology research and, thus, is well suited to study intense variability patterns across areas of dysfunction in BPD. "
2018,0,"EMA studies are characterized by frequent repeated assessments that are delivered to participants in real-life, real-time settings using handheld devices capable of registering responses to short self-report questions in daily life. "
2019,0,"Compliance in EMA research is defined as the proportion of prompts answered by the participant, considering all planned prompts sent. "
2020,0,Low compliance with prompt schedules can compromise the relative advantages of using this method. 
2021,0,"Despite the growing EMA literature on BPD in recent years, findings regarding study design features that affect compliance with EMA protocols have not been compiled, aggregated, and estimated."
2022,1,"A systematic review was conducted on November 12, 2021, following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and MOOSE (Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines to search for articles featuring EMA studies of BPD that reported compliance rates and included sufficient data to extract relevant design features. "
2023,1,"For studies with complete data, random-effect models were used to estimate the overall compliance rate and explore its association with design features."
2024,2,"In total, 28 peer-reviewed EMA studies comprising 2052 participants were included in the study. "
2025,2,"Design features (sampling strategy, average prompting frequency, number of items, response window, sampling device, financial incentive, and dropout rate) showed a large variability across studies, and many studies did not report design features. "
2026,2,The meta-analytic synthesis was restricted to 64% (18/28) of articles and revealed a pooled compliance rate of 79% across studies. 
2027,2,We did not find any significant relationship between design features and compliance rates.
2028,3,Our results show wide variability in the design and reporting of EMA studies assessing BPD. 
2029,3,"Compliance rates appear to be stable across varying setups, and it is likely that standard design features are not directly responsible for improving or diminishing compliance. "
2030,3,We discuss possible nonspecific factors of study design that may have an impact on compliance. 
2031,3,"Given the promise of EMA research in BPD, we also discuss the importance of unifying standards for EMA reporting so that data stemming from this rich literature can be aggregated and interpreted jointly."
2032,4,Implementation Science Perspectives on Implementing Telemedicine Interventions for Hypertension or Diabetes Management: Scoping Review
2033,0,Hypertension and diabetes are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. 
2034,0,"Telemedicine is an accessible and cost-effective means of supporting hypertension and diabetes management, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technological solutions for care. "
2035,0,"However, to date, no review has examined the contextual factors that influence the implementation of telemedicine interventions for hypertension or diabetes worldwide."
2036,1,"We performed a scoping review involving searches in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify studies published in English from 2017 to 2022 describing barriers and facilitators related to the implementation of telemedicine interventions for hypertension and diabetes management. "
2037,1,The coding and synthesis of barriers and facilitators were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.
2038,2,"Of the 17,687 records identified, 35 (0.2%) studies were included in our scoping review. "
2039,2,We found that facilitators of and barriers to implementation were dispersed across the constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. 
2040,2,"Barriers related to cost, patient needs and resources (eg, lack of consideration of language needs, culture, and rural residency), and personal attributes of patients (eg, demographics and priorities) were the most common. "
2041,2,"Facilitators related to the design and packaging of the intervention (eg, user-friendliness), patient needs and resources (eg, personalized information that leveraged existing strengths), implementation climate (eg, intervention embedded into existing infrastructure), knowledge of and beliefs about the intervention (eg, convenience of telemedicine), and other personal attributes (eg, technical literacy) were the most common."
2042,3,"Our findings suggest that the successful implementation of telemedicine interventions for hypertension and diabetes requires comprehensive efforts at the planning, execution, engagement, and reflection and evaluation stages of intervention implementation to address challenges at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, and environmental levels."
2043,4,"An Assessment of Perspectives and Concerns Among Research Participants of Childbearing Age Regarding the Health-Relatedness of Data, Online Data Privacy, and Donating Data to Researchers: Survey Study"
2044,0,"The June 2022 US Supreme Court decision to ban abortion care in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization sparked ominous debate about the privacy and safety of women and families of childbearing age with digital footprints who actively engage in family planning, including abortion and miscarriage care."
2045,1,An 18-item electronic survey was developed using Qualtrics and administered to adults (aged >= 18 years) registered in the ResearchMatch database in April 2021. 
2046,1,"Individuals were invited to participate in the survey regardless of health status, race, gender, or any other mutable or immutable characteristics. "
2047,1,"Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel and manual queries (single layer, bottom-up topic modeling) and used to categorize illuminating quotes from free-text survey responses."
2048,2,A total of 470 participants initiated the survey and 402 completed and submitted the survey (for an 86% completion rate). 
2049,2,"Nearly half the participants (189/402, 47%) self-reported to be persons of childbearing age (18 to 50 years). "
2050,2,"Most participants of childbearing age agreed or strongly agreed that social media data, email data, text message data, Google search history data, online purchase history data, electronic medical record data, fitness tracker and wearable data, credit card statement data, and genetic data are health-related. "
2051,2,"Most participants disagreed or strongly disagreed that music streaming data, Yelp review and rating data, ride-sharing history data, tax records and other income history data, voting history data, and geolocation data are health-related. "
2052,2,"Most (164/189, 87%) participants were concerned about fraud or abuse based on their personal information, online companies and websites sharing information with other parties without consent, and online companies and websites using information for purposes that are not explicitly stated in their privacy policies. "
2053,2,"Free-text survey responses showed that participants were concerned about data use beyond scope of consent; exclusion from health care and insurance; government and corporate mistrust; and data confidentiality, security, and discretion."
2054,3,Our findings in light of Dobbs and other related events indicate there are opportunities to educate research participants about the health-relatedness of their digital data. 
2055,3,"Developing strategies and best privacy practices for discretion regarding digital-footprint data related to family planning should be a priority for companies, researchers, families, and other stakeholders."
2056,4,Attitudes and Experiences of Clinicians After Mandated Implementation of Open Notes by the 21st Century Cures Act: Survey Study
2057,0,"On December 13, 2016, the US Congress enacted the 21st Century Cures Act (hereafter the Cures Act), which contained the Final Rule mandate that took effect on April 5, 2021. "
2058,0,"Since then, health systems have been required to provide patients digital access to their eHealth information ""without delay"" and without charge."
2059,1,"This cross-sectional survey study was conducted between June 10, 2021, and August 15, 2021, at the University of Kansas Health System, a large academic medical center in Kansas City, Kansas, United States. "
2060,1,"Participants included clinicians currently employed by the health system, including resident and attending physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and critical care and emergency medicine registered nurses."
2061,2,"A total of 1574 attending physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, as well as 506 critical care and emergency medicine nurses, were sent invitations; 538 (34.18%) and 72 (14.2%), respectively, responded. "
2062,2,"Of 609 resident physicians, 4 (response rate not applicable because it was unknown how many residents viewed the website while the link was available) responded. "
2063,2,"The majority of respondents were attending physicians (402/614, 65.5%) and within the department of internal medicine (160/614, 26.1%). "
2064,2,"Most agreed that sharing visit notes was a good idea (355/613, 57.9%) and that it is important to speak with the patients before they accessed their records (431/613, 70.3%). "
2065,2,"Those who agreed that sharing visit notes is a good idea tended to view the practice as a useful tool for engaging patients (""Agree"": 139/355, 39.2%; ""Somewhat agree"": 161/355, 45.4%; P<.001) and experience no change in the clinical value of their notes for other clinicians (326/355, 91.8%; P<.001). "
2066,2,"Those who disagreed (or were neutral) tended not to encourage patients to read their notes (235/258, 91.1%; P<.001) and were more likely to experience a change in their charting practice (168/257, 65.4%; P<.001) and increased time charting (99/258, 38.4%; P<.001)."
2067,3,"The findings of this study may be generalizable to institutions similar to the University of Kansas Health System, and the clinician testimonies gathered in this study may provide valuable insight into the initial opinions and experiences of clinicians at these institutions. "
2068,3,"In addition, these clinician experiences collected early in the transition period may be used to guide future health policy implementation and to understand how best to prepare clinicians for these changes in practice."
2069,4,Using Social Media Data to Investigate Public Perceptions of Cannabis as a Medicine: Narrative Review
2070,0,The use and acceptance of medicinal cannabis is on the rise across the globe. 
2071,0,"To support the interests of public health, evidence relating to its use, effects, and safety is required to match this community demand. "
2072,0,"Web-based user-generated data are often used by researchers and public health organizations for the investigation of consumer perceptions, market forces, population behaviors, and for pharmacoepidemiology."
2073,1,The inclusion criteria for this review were primary research studies and reviews that reported on the analysis of web-based user-generated content on cannabis as medicine. 
2074,1,"The MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched from January 1974 to April 2022."
2075,2,We examined 42 studies published in English and found that consumers value their ability to exchange experiences on the web and tend to rely on web-based information sources. 
2076,2,"Cannabis discussions have portrayed the substance as a safe and natural medicine to help with many health conditions including cancer, sleep disorders, chronic pain, opioid use disorders, headaches, asthma, bowel disease, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. "
2077,2,"These discussions provide a rich resource for researchers to investigate medicinal cannabis-related consumer sentiment and experiences, including the opportunity to monitor cannabis effects and adverse events, given the anecdotal and often biased nature of the information is properly accounted for."
2078,3,The extensive web-based presence of the cannabis industry coupled with the conversational nature of social media discourse results in rich but potentially biased information that is often not well-supported by scientific evidence. 
2079,3,"This review summarizes what social media is saying about the medicinal use of cannabis and discusses the challenges faced by health governance agencies and professionals to make use of web-based resources to both learn from medicinal cannabis users and provide factual, timely, and reliable evidence-based health information to consumers."
2080,4,Real-Time Detection of Sleep Apnea Based on Breathing Sounds and Prediction Reinforcement Using Home Noises: Algorithm Development and Validation
2081,0,Multinight monitoring can be helpful for the diagnosis and management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 
2082,0,"For this purpose, it is necessary to be able to detect OSA in real time in a noisy home environment. "
2083,0,Sound-based OSA assessment holds great potential since it can be integrated with smartphones to provide full noncontact monitoring of OSA at home.
2084,1,"This study included 1018 polysomnography (PSG) audio data sets, 297 smartphone audio data sets synced with PSG, and a home noise data set containing 22,500 noises to train the model to predict breathing events, such as apneas and hypopneas, based on breathing sounds that occur during sleep. "
2085,1,"The whole breathing sound of each night was divided into 30-second epochs and labeled as ""apnea,"" ""hypopnea,"" or ""no-event,"" and the home noises were used to make the model robust to a noisy home environment. "
2086,1,The performance of the prediction model was assessed using epoch-by-epoch prediction accuracy and OSA severity
2087,2,Epoch-by-epoch OSA event detection showed an accuracy of 86% and a macro F1-score of 0.75 for the 3-class OSA event detection task. 
2088,2,"The model had an accuracy of 92% for ""no-event,"" 84% for ""apnea,"" and 51% for ""hypopnea."" Most misclassifications were made for ""hypopnea,"" with 15% and 34% of ""hypopnea"" being wrongly predicted as ""apnea"" and ""no-event,"" respectively. "
2089,2,"The sensitivity and specificity of the OSA severity classification (AHI >= 15) were 0.85 and 0.84, respectively."
2090,3,Our study presents a real-time epoch-by-epoch OSA detector that works in a variety of noisy home environments. 
2091,3,"Based on this, additional research is needed to verify the usefulness of various multinight monitoring and real-time diagnostic technologies in the home environment."
2092,4,Prevention of Unplanned Hospital Admissions in Multimorbid Patients Using Computational Modeling: Observational Retrospective Cohort Study
2093,0,Enhanced management of multimorbidity constitutes a major clinical challenge. 
2094,0,"Multimorbidity shows well-established causal relationships with the high use of health care resources and, specifically, with unplanned hospital admissions. "
2095,0,Enhanced patient stratification is vital for achieving effectiveness through personalized postdischarge service selection.
2096,1,"Gradient boosting techniques were used to generate predictive models based on multisource data (registries, clinical/functional and social support) from 761 nonsurgical patients admitted in a tertiary hospital over 12 months (October 2017 to November 2018). "
2097,1,K-means clustering was used to characterize patient profiles.
2098,2,"Performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity) of the predictive models was 0.82, 0.78, and 0.70 and 0.72, 0.70, and 0.63 for mortality and readmissions, respectively. "
2099,2,A total of 4 patients' profiles were identified. 
2100,2,"In brief, the reference patients (cluster 1; 281/761, 36.9%), 53.7% (151/281) men and mean age of 71 (SD 16) years, showed 3.6% (10/281) mortality and 15.7% (44/281) readmissions at 90 days following discharge. "
2101,2,"The unhealthy lifestyle habit profile (cluster 2; 179/761, 23.5%) predominantly comprised males (137/179, 76.5%) with similar age, mean 70 (SD 13) years, but showed slightly higher mortality (10/179, 5.6%) and markedly higher readmission rate (49/179, 27.4%). "
2102,2,"Patients in the frailty profile (cluster 3; 152/761, 19.9%) were older (mean 81 years, SD 13 years) and predominantly female (63/152, 41.4%, males). "
2103,2,"They showed medical complexity with a high level of social vulnerability and the highest mortality rate (23/152, 15.1%), but with a similar hospitalization rate (39/152, 25.7%) compared with cluster 2. "
2104,2,"Finally, the medical complexity profile (cluster 4; 149/761, 19.6%), mean age 83 (SD 9) years, 55.7% (83/149) males, showed the highest clinical complexity resulting in 12.8% (19/149) mortality and the highest readmission rate (56/149, 37.6%)."
2105,3,The results indicated the potential to predict mortality and morbidity-related adverse events leading to unplanned hospital readmissions. 
2106,3,The resulting patient profiles fostered recommendations for personalized service selection with the capacity for value generation.
2107,4,Functional Requirements for Medical Data Integration into Knowledge Management Environments: Requirements Elicitation Approach Based on Systematic Literature Analysis
2108,0,"In patient care, data are historically generated and stored in heterogeneous databases that are domain specific and often noninteroperable or isolated. "
2109,0,"As the amount of health data increases, the number of isolated data silos is also expected to grow, limiting the accessibility of the collected data. "
2110,0,Medical informatics is developing ways to move from siloed data to a more harmonized arrangement in information architectures. 
2111,0,This paradigm shift will allow future research to integrate medical data at various levels and from various sources. 
2112,0,"Currently, comprehensive requirements engineering is working on data integration projects in both patient care- and research-oriented contexts, and it is significantly contributing to the success of such projects. "
2113,0,"In addition to various stakeholder-based methods, document-based requirement elicitation is a valid method for improving the scope and quality of requirements."
2114,1,This work began by conducting a literature-based requirement elicitation based on a broad requirement engineering approach. 
2115,1,"Thus, in the first step, we performed a web-based systematic literature review to identify published articles that dealt with the requirements for medical data integration. "
2116,1,We identified and analyzed the available literature by applying the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. 
2117,1,"In the second step, we screened the results for functional requirements using the requirements engineering method of document analysis and derived the requirements into a uniform requirement syntax. "
2118,1,"Finally, we classified the elicited requirements into a category scheme that represents the data life cycle."
2119,2,"Our 2-step requirements elicitation approach yielded 821 articles, of which 61 (7.4%) were included in the requirement elicitation process. "
2120,2,"There, we identified 220 requirements, which were covered by 314 references. "
2121,2,"We assigned the requirements to different data life cycle categories as follows: 25% (55/220) to data acquisition, 35.9% (79/220) to data processing, 12.7% (28/220) to data storage, 9.1% (20/220) to data analysis, 6.4% (14/220) to metadata management, 2.3% (5/220) to data lineage, 3.2% (7/220) to data traceability, and 5.5% (12/220) to data security."
2122,3,The aim of this study was to present a cross-section of functional data integration-related requirements defined in the literature by other researchers. 
2123,3,The aim was achieved with 220 distinct requirements from 61 publications. 
2124,3,"We concluded that scientific publications are, in principle, a reliable source of information for functional requirements with respect to medical data integration. "
2125,3,"Finally, we provide a broad catalog to support other scientists in the requirement elicitation phase."
2126,4,Nominal Versus Realized Costs of Recruiting and Retaining a National Sample of Sexual Minority Adolescents in the United States: Longitudinal Study
2127,0,Web-based recruitment for research studies is becoming increasingly popular and necessary. 
2128,0,"When compared with the traditional methods of recruitment, these methods may enable researchers to reach more diverse participants in less time. "
2129,0,"Social media use is highly prevalent among adolescents, and the unique context of social media may be particularly important for the recruitment of sexual minority young people who would not be captured by traditional methods."
2130,1,"This study recruited sexual minority adolescents aged 14-17 years living in the United States through targeted advertisements on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube and through respondent-driven sampling (RDS). "
2131,1,Potential participants completed eligibility screening surveys and were automatically directed to a baseline survey if they were eligible. 
2132,1,"After baseline survey completion, additional data checks were implemented, and the remaining participants were contacted for recruitment into a longitudinal study (surveys every 6 months for 3 years)."
2133,2,"Recruitment lasted 44 weeks, and 9843 participants accessed the initial screening survey, with 2732 (27.76%) meeting the eligibility criteria and completing the baseline survey. "
2134,2,"Of those, 2558 (93.63%) were determined to have provided nonfraudulent, usable study data and 1076 (39.39%) subsequently enrolled in the longitudinal study. "
2135,2,"Of the baseline sample, 79.05% (2022/2558) was recruited through Facebook and Instagram, 3.05% (78/2558) through YouTube, and 17.9% (458/2558) through RDS. "
2136,2,"The average cost of recruiting a participant into the study was US $12.98, but the recruitment cost varied by method or platform, with a realized cost of US $13 per participant on Facebook and Instagram, US $24 on YouTube, and US $10 through RDS. "
2137,2,"Participant differences (sex assigned at birth, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, region, and urbanicity) were identified between platforms and methods both in terms of overall number of participants and cost per participant. "
2138,2,"Facebook and Instagram were the most time efficient (approximately 15 days to recruit 100 participants), whereas RDS was the least time efficient (approximately 70 days to recruit 100 participants). "
2139,2,"Participants recruited through YouTube were the most likely to be longitudinally retained, followed by Facebook and Instagram, and then RDS."
2140,3,Large differences exist in study recruitment cost and efficiency when using social media and RDS. 
2141,3,"Demographic, region, and urbanicity differences in recruitment methods highlight the need for attention to demographic diversity when planning and implementing recruitment across platforms. "
2142,3,"Finally, it is more cost-effective to retain than recruit samples, and this study provided evidence that with thorough screening and data quality practices, social media recruitment can result in diverse, highly involved study populations."
2143,4,The Effectiveness of eHealth Interventions on Lifestyle Modification in Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
2144,0,The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in parallel with the epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome. 
2145,0,"Lifestyle modification is a crucial strategy for the treatment of NAFLD, which can lead to a reduction in liver fat with concomitant weight loss. "
2146,0,The use of eHealth technologies is an effective approach to improve health outcomes in patients as they do not have any time and space limitations.
2147,1,We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. 
2148,1,"Five electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science) were searched for studies reporting the effect of lifestyle modification intervention using eHealth in patients with NAFLD published from inception to November 3, 2022. "
2149,1,"Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by 3 researchers independently. "
2150,1,The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies.
2151,2,"In total, 2688 records were identified, and 41 full-text articles were assessed. "
2152,2,Seven studies were included in the systematic review. 
2153,2,"The participants of all interventions were 1257 individuals with NAFLD, and the mean age ranged from 38.3 to 57.9 years. "
2154,2,"The duration of the interventions was 3-24 months, and all interventions were categorized into 3 types: internet-based computers, telephones, and mobile apps. "
2155,2,"Of these, 4 studies were randomized controlled trials and were included in the meta-analysis: 3 studies for body weight and BMI and 4 studies for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). "
2156,2,"According to the meta-analysis, clear improvements in BMI (P=.02; 95% CI -1.01 to -0.10), AST (P=.02; 95% CI -1.22 to -0.13), and ALT (P=.01; 95% CI -1.28 to -0.15) were observed in the eHealth intervention as compared with the control groups."
2157,3,"Lifestyle modification interventions using eHealth technologies are significantly effective for BMI, AST, and ALT in patients with NAFLD. "
2158,3,"Future research should conduct interventions with larger sample sizes and evaluate whether these interventions have sustained benefits, and how we can make these eHealth methods most effective on a large scale."
2159,4,"Internet-Based Self-Assessment for Symptoms of Internet Use Disorder-Impact of Gender, Social Aspects, and Symptom Severity: German Cross-sectional Study"
2160,0,Internet use disorder (IUD) is a new type of behavioral addiction in the digital age. 
2161,0,"At the same time, internet applications and eHealth can also provide useful support in medical treatment."
2162,1,"Data were retrieved from the OMPRIS (online-based motivational intervention to reduce problematic internet use and promote treatment motivation in internet gaming disorder and internet use disorder) project (DRKS00019925), an internet-based motivational intervention to reduce problematic internet use and promote treatment motivation in internet gaming disorder and IUD. "
2163,1,"During the recruitment process (August 2020-March 2022), a total of 3007 individuals filled out the standardized scale for the assessment of internet and computer game addiction (AICA-S). "
2164,1,The assessment was accessible via the project homepage. 
2165,1,"There was no preselection of participants at this stage of the study; however, the offer was addressed to people with hazardous internet use and IUDs. "
2166,1,"The web-based assessment was free and could be found via search engines, but attention was also drawn to the service via newspaper articles, radio reports, and podcasts."
2167,2,"Out of 3007 who participated in the web-based self-assessment, 1033 (34.4%) are female, 1740 (57.9%) are male, 67 (2.2%) are diverse individuals, and 167 (5.5%) did not disclose their gender. "
2168,2,The IUD symptom severity score showed a wide range between the AICA-S extreme values of 0 and 27 points. 
2169,2,"On average, the total sample (mean 8.19, SD 5.47) was in the range of hazardous IUD behavior (AICA-S cutoff>7.0). "
2170,2,"Furthermore, 561 individuals (18.7% of the total sample; mean 17.42, SD 3.38) presented severe IUD (AICA-S cutoff>13.5). "
2171,2,"Focusing on female and male participants, 20.9% (363/1740) of the men and 14.9% (151/1033) of the women scored above 13.5 points, which can be considered pathological IUD behavior (chi(2)(2,2773)=16.73, P<.001, effect size: Cramer V=0.078). "
2172,2,"Unemployment, being in vocational training or studying at a university, and being male were significantly associated with high IUD symptoms."
2173,3,"Using a large sample, the study showed that both mildly and severely IUD-affected individuals can be reached via the internet. "
2174,3,An internet-based eHealth offer can thus be a good way to reach patients with IUD where they are addicted-on the internet. 
2175,3,"In addition, eHealth services increase the likelihood of reaching female patients, who hardly ever come to specialized outpatient clinics and hospitals. "
2176,3,"Since social problems, especially unemployment, have a strong association with disease severity, the integration of social counseling into treatment seems advisable in terms of a multidisciplinary approach."
2177,4,Patient Trust in Physicians Matters-Understanding the Role of a Mobile Patient Education System and Patient-Physician Communication in Improving Patient Adherence Behavior: Field Study
2178,0,The ultimate goal of any prescribed medical therapy is to achieve desired outcomes of patient care. 
2179,0,"However, patient nonadherence has long been a major problem detrimental to patient health, and thus is a concern for all health care providers. "
2180,0,"Moreover, nonadherence is extremely costly for global medical systems because of unnecessary complications and expenses. "
2181,0,"Traditional patient education programs often serve as an intervention tool to increase patients' self-care awareness, disease knowledge, and motivation to change patient behaviors for better adherence. "
2182,0,"Patient trust in physicians, patient-physician relationships, and quality of communication have also been identified as critical factors influencing patient adherence. "
2183,0,"However, little is known about how mobile patient education technologies help foster patient adherence."
2184,1,This study was conducted based on a field survey of 125 patients in multiple states in the United States who have used an innovative mobile health care system for their health care education and information seeking. 
2185,1,Partial least squares techniques were used to analyze the collected data.
2186,2,The results revealed that patient-physician communication and the use of an MPES significantly increase patients' trust in their physicians. 
2187,2,"Furthermore, patient trust has a prominent effect on patient attitude toward treatment adherence, which in turn influences patients' behavioral intention and actual adherence behavior. "
2188,2,"Based on the theory of planned behavior, the results also indicated that behavioral intention, response efficacy, and self-efficacy positively influenced patients' actual treatment adherence behavior, whereas descriptive norms and subjective norms do not play a role in this process."
2189,3,Our study is one of the first that examines the relationship between patients who actively use an MPES and their trust in their physicians. 
2190,3,"This study contributes to this context by enriching the trust literature, addressing the call to identify key patient-centered technology determinants of trust, advancing the understanding of patient adherence mechanisms, adding a new explanation of the influence of education mechanisms delivered via mobile devices on patient adherence, and confirming that the theory of planned behavior holds in this patient adherence context."
2191,4,"Efficacy of Internet-Based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, Stress, Psychological Distress, and Quality of Life: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"
2192,0,Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an empirically supported transdiagnostic approach that involves mindfulness processes and behavior change processes for valued living.
2193,1,"PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and SCOPUS databases were searched to identify relevant RCTs published up to June 5, 2021. "
2194,1,The included RCTs were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. 
2195,1,The use of either a random effects model or fixed effects model was determined using I2 statistic values for heterogeneity. 
2196,1,"Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the type of control group, the use of therapist guidance, delivery modes, and the use of targeted participants, when applicable."
2197,2,A total of 39 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. 
2198,2,"Meta-analyses found small effects of iACT on depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, psychological distress, and QoL at the immediate posttest and follow-up. "
2199,2,There was no significant effect of iACT on stress at follow-up. 
2200,2,Subgroup analyses showed small to medium effects of iACT on all the outcomes at the immediate posttest and follow-up compared with the passive control groups. 
2201,2,"In contrast, subgroup analyses that compared iACT with active control groups found no differences between groups on stress, psychological distress, and QoL at the immediate posttest or on depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress at follow-up. "
2202,2,"In addition, subgroup analyses conducted according to the use of therapist guidance, delivery modes, and the use of targeted participants found no statistically significant subgroup differences among studies in all the outcomes, except for the subgroup difference among studies according to the use of targeted participants for depressive symptoms at the immediate posttest (ie, a statistically significant, larger effect of iACT when studies targeted people with depressive symptoms). "
2203,2,The overall risk of bias across the studies was unclear.
2204,3,"The findings of this study contribute to the body of evidence regarding the effects of iACT on depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, psychological distress, and QoL and may be applicable in any population, as ACT is a transdiagnostic approach. "
2205,3,"Few studies have compared iACT with active control conditions, especially for stress and psychological distress at the immediate posttest and follow-up. "
2206,3,"In addition, the active control conditions varied among the included studies. "
2207,3,"Further high-quality studies are needed to better understand whether iACT is comparable or superior to other evidence-based interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, in decreasing depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, and psychological distress and improving QoL."
2208,4,Automated Digital Interventions and Smoking Cessation: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Relating Efficiency to a Psychological Theory of Intervention Perspective
2209,0,Smoking remains a highly significant preventable global public health problem. 
2210,0,"In this context, digital interventions offer great advantages in terms of a lack of biological side effects, possibility of automatic delivery, and consequent human resource savings relative to traditional interventions. "
2211,0,Such interventions have been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but have not been systematically reviewed with the inclusion of text-based and multiplatform-based interventions. 
2212,0,"In addition, this area has not been evaluated from the perspective of the psychological theoretical basis of intervention."
2213,1,"An electronic search of RCTs was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library by June 30, 2021. "
2214,1,Eligible studies had to compare automated digital intervention (ADI) to the use of a self-help guideline or no intervention. 
2215,1,Participants were current smokers (aged 16 years or older). 
2216,1,"As the main outcome, abstinence after endpoint was extracted from the studies. "
2217,1,Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficiency of ADIs. 
2218,1,Metaregressions were conducted to assess the relationship between intervention theory and effectiveness.
2219,2,"A total of 19 trials (15,472 participants) were included in the analysis. "
2220,2,The overall abstinence rate (95% CI) at the endpoint was 17.8% (17.0-18.7). 
2221,2,The overall risk ratio of the intervention group compared to the controls at the endpoint was 17.8% (17.0-18.7). 
2222,2,Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (ROB 2) suggested that most of the studies had a low risk of bias (56.3%). 
2223,2,"Psychological theory-related constructs or predictors, which refer to other theory-based concepts (rather than only behavioral theory) such as craving or anxiety, are associated with effectiveness."
2224,3,"This study found that ADI had a clear positive effect compared to self-help guidelines or to no intervention, and effectiveness was associated with theory-related constructs or predictors. "
2225,3,ADIs should be promoted by policy makers and clinical practitioners to address the huge gap between the need for smoking cessation and availability of traditional treatment resources. 
2226,3,Possible increases in ADI efficiency may be achieved by optimally integrating psychotherapeutic theories and techniques.
2227,4,Fine-tuned Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Social Media Data: Comparative Study
2228,0,The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the necessary separation of populations have led to an unprecedented number of new social media users seeking information related to the pandemic. 
2229,0,"Currently, with an estimated 4.5 billion users worldwide, social media data offer an opportunity for near real-time analysis of large bodies of text related to disease outbreaks and vaccination. "
2230,0,"These analyses can be used by officials to develop appropriate public health messaging, digital interventions, educational materials, and policies."
2231,1,"To accomplish this task, we created a fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model to predict the sentiments of approximately 9.5 million tweets and 70 thousand Reddit comments. "
2232,1,"To fine-tune our model, our team manually labeled the sentiment of 3600 tweets and then augmented our data set through back-translation. "
2233,1,Text sentiment for each social media platform was then classified with our fine-tuned model using Python programming language and the Hugging Face sentiment analysis pipeline.
2234,2,"Our results determined that the average sentiment expressed on Twitter was more negative (5,215,830/9,518,270, 54.8%) than positive, and the sentiment expressed on Reddit was more positive (42,316/67,962, 62.3%) than negative. "
2235,2,"Although the average sentiment was found to vary between these social media platforms, both platforms displayed similar behavior related to the sentiment shared at key vaccine-related developments during the pandemic."
2236,3,"Considering this similar trend in shared sentiment demonstrated across social media platforms, Twitter and Reddit continue to be valuable data sources that public health officials can use to strengthen vaccine confidence and combat misinformation. "
2237,3,"As the spread of misinformation poses a range of psychological and psychosocial risks (anxiety and fear, etc), there is an urgency in understanding the public perspective and attitude toward shared falsities. "
2238,3,"Comprehensive educational delivery systems tailored to a population's expressed sentiments that facilitate digital literacy, health information-seeking behavior, and precision health promotion could aid in clarifying such misinformation."
2239,4,Trends in Effectiveness of Organizational eHealth Interventions in Addressing Employee Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
2240,0,"Mental health conditions are considered the leading cause of disability, sickness absence, and long-term work incapacity. "
2241,0,eHealth interventions provide employees with access to psychological assistance. 
2242,0,There has been widespread implementation and provision of eHealth interventions in the workplace as an inexpensive and anonymous way of addressing common mental disorders.
2243,1,Systematic searches of relevant articles published from 2004 to July 2020 of eHealth intervention trials (app-or web-based) focusing on the mental health of employees were conducted. 
2244,1,The quality and bias of all studies were assessed. 
2245,1,We extracted means and SDs from publications by comparing the differences in effect sizes (Hedge g) in standardized mental health outcomes. 
2246,1,We meta-analyzed these data using a random-effects model.
2247,2,"We identified a tripling of the body of evidence, with 75 trials available for meta-analysis from a combined sample of 14,747 articles. "
2248,2,"eHealth interventions showed small positive effects for anxiety (Hedges g=0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.39; P<.001), depression (Hedges g=0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.34; P<.001), and stress (Hedges g=0.25, 95% CI 0.17-0.34; P<.001) in employees' after intervention, with similar effects seen at the medium-term follow-up. "
2249,2,"However, there was evidence of no increase in the effectiveness of these interventions over the past decade."
2250,3,This review and meta-analysis confirmed that eHealth interventions have a small positive impact on reducing mental health symptoms in employees. 
2251,3,"Disappointingly, we found no evidence that, despite the advances in technology and the enormous resources in time, research, and finance devoted to this area for over a decade, better interventions are being produced. "
2252,3,"Hopefully, these small effect sizes do not represent optimum outcomes in organizational settings. "

2254,4,The Internet Knows More Than My Physician: Qualitative Interview Study of People With Rare Diseases and How They Use Online Support Groups
2255,0,Patients struggling with rare diseases may face challenges caused by care providers being unfamiliar with their condition. 
2256,0,"The life span of people with rare diseases may be the same as that of healthy people, but their quality of life is different. "
2257,0,Patients with chronic pain are constantly looking for ways to mitigate their pain. 
2258,0,Pain killers are not a permanent solution. 
2259,0,"In addition to the medical and nonmedical costs of rare diseases for both patients and health care providers, there is a need for sustainable sources of information that are available to help with pain and improve their quality of life, with the goal of reducing physician visits and hospital admissions."
2260,1,Interviews were conducted via Zoom between July 2021 and December 2021. 
2261,1,"Eligible participants were those who were aged >18 years, had a medical diagnosis of any type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) with chronic pain, and were members of any support group. "
2262,1,Participants were recruited through an announcement in the research and survey section of The Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Society web page. 
2263,1,"Interviews were analyzed using the framework approach Data were systematically searched to identify patterns, analyze them, and identify themes. "
2264,1,Interview audio files were transcribed and independently coded by two researchers (SA and AT). 
2265,1,"Through an iterative process, a final coding table was agreed upon by the researchers and used to thematically analyze the data."
2266,2,"We interviewed 30 participants (mean age 37.7, SD 15 years; n=28, 93% were women; n=23, 77% were residing in the United States). "
2267,2,Thematic analysis revealed that participants (patients with EDS) were constantly in pain and most of them have not received accurate and timely diagnoses for many years. 
2268,2,"They expressed their challenges with health care providers regarding diagnosis and treatment, and complained about their providers' lack of support and knowledge. "
2269,2,"Participants' main sources of information were web-based searches, academic journals, The Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Society web page, and online peer support groups on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram. "
2270,2,"Although pain killers, cannabis, and opioids are providing some pain relief, most patients (28/30, 93%) focused on nonmedical approaches, such as hot or ice packs, physical therapy, exercises, massage, mindfulness, and meditation."
2271,3,This study highlights the information gap between health care providers and patients with genetic disorders. 
2272,3,Patients with EDS seek access to information from different web-based sources. 
2273,3,"To meet the needs of patients with genetic disorders, future interventions via web-based resources for improving the quality of care must be considered by health care professionals and government agencies."
2274,4,Identifying Influences in Patient Decision-making Processes in Online Health Communities: Data Science Approach
2275,0,"In recent years, an increasing number of users have joined online health communities (OHCs) to obtain information and seek support. "
2276,0,Patients often look for information and suggestions to support their health care decision-making. 
2277,0,It is important to understand patient decision-making processes and identify the influences that patients receive from OHCs.
2278,1,We proposed a definition of influence relationship of posts in discussion threads. 
2279,1,We then developed a framework and a deep learning model for identifying influence relationships. 
2280,1,We leveraged the state-of-the-art text relevance measurement methods to generate sparse feature vectors to present text relevance. 
2281,1,We modeled the probability of question and action presence in a post as dense features. 
2282,1,We then used deep learning techniques to combine the sparse and dense features to learn the influence relationships.
2283,2,We evaluated the proposed techniques on discussion threads from a popular cancer survivor OHC. 
2284,2,The empirical evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.
2285,3,It is feasible to identify influence relationships in OHCs. 
2286,3,"Using the proposed techniques, a significant number of discussions on an OHC were identified to have had influence. "
2287,3,Such discussions are more likely to affect user decision-making processes and engage users' participation in OHCs. 
2288,3,"Studies on those discussions can help improve information quality, user engagement, and user experience."
2289,4,An Identity-Affirming Web Application to Help Sexual and Gender Minority Youth Cope With Minority Stress: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
2290,0,"Efficacious mental health interventions for sexual and gender minority youth have had limited reach, given their delivery as time-intensive, in-person sessions. "
2291,0,"Internet-based interventions may facilitate reach to sexual and gender minority youth; however, there is little research examining their efficacy."
2292,1,"Sexual and gender minority youth (N=270) aged 13 to 19 (mean 16.5, SD 1.5) years and living in the United States were recruited through Instagram advertisements. "
2293,1,Approximately 78% (210/270) of the sample identified as racial or ethnic minorities. 
2294,1,"Participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the full imi intervention web application (treatment; 135/270, 50%) or a resource page-only version of the imi site (control; 135/270, 50%). "
2295,1,"The imi application covered four topical areas: gender identity; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender minority identity; stress and coping; and internalized homophobia and transphobia. "
2296,1,"Participants explored these areas by engaging with informational resources, exercises, and peer stories at a self-guided pace. "
2297,1,"Both arms were assessed via web-based surveys at baseline and 4-week follow-up for intervention satisfaction, stress appraisals (ie, challenge, threat, and resource), coping skills (ie, instrumental support, positive reframing, and planning), and mental health symptoms among other outcomes. "
2298,1,"Main intent-to-treat analyses compared the arms at week 4, controlling for baseline values on each outcome."
2299,2,Survey retention was 90.4% (244/270) at week 4. 
2300,2,Participants in the treatment arm reported greater satisfaction with the intervention than participants in the control arm (t(241) =-2.98; P=.003). 
2301,2,"The treatment arm showed significantly greater improvement in challenge appraisals (ie, belief in one's coping abilities) than the control (Cohen d=0.26; P=.008). "
2302,2,There were no differences between the arms for threat (d=0.10; P=.37) or resource (d=0.15; P=.14) appraisals. 
2303,2,"The treatment arm showed greater increases in coping skills than the control arm (instrumental support: d=0.24, P=.005; positive reframing: d=0.27, P=.02; planning: d=0.26, P=.02). "
2304,2,"Mental health symptoms improved across both the treatment and control arms; however, there were no differences between arms. "
2305,2,"Within the treatment arm, higher engagement with imi (>= 5 sessions, >10 minutes, or >10 pages) predicted greater improvement in stress appraisals (all P values <.05)."
2306,3,The results provide initial evidence that asynchronous psychosocial interventions delivered via a web application to sexual and gender minority youth can support their ability to cope with minority stress. 
2307,3,Further research is needed to examine the long-term effects of the imi application.
2308,4,Using an Integrated Framework to Investigate the Facilitators and Barriers of Health Information Technology Implementation in Noncommunicable Disease Management: Systematic Review
2309,0,Noncommunicable disease (NCD) management is critical for reducing attributable health burdens. 
2310,0,"Although health information technology (HIT) is a crucial strategy to improve chronic disease management, many health care systems have failed in implementing HIT. "
2311,0,There has been a lack of research on the implementation process of HIT for chronic disease management.
2312,1,We conducted a systematic review to understand the barriers and facilitators of the implementation process. 
2313,1,"We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL for studies published between database inception and May 5, 2022. "
2314,1,Original studies involving HIT-related interventions for NCD management published in peer-reviewed journals were included. 
2315,1,Studies that did not discuss relevant outcome measures or did not have direct contact with or observation of stakeholders were excluded. 
2316,1,The analysis was conducted in 2 parts. 
2317,1,"In part 1, we analyzed how the intrinsic attributes of HIT interventions affect the successfulness of implementation by using the intervention domain of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). "
2318,1,"In part 2, we focused on the extrinsic factors of HIT using an integrated framework, which was developed based on the CFIR and the levels of change framework by Ferlie and Shortell."
2319,2,"We identified 51 papers with qualitative, mixed-method, and cross-sectional methodologies. "
2320,2,Included studies were heterogeneous regarding disease populations and HIT interventions. 
2321,2,"In part 1, having a relative advantage over existing health care systems was the most prominent intrinsic facilitator (eg, convenience, improvement in quality of care, and increase in access). "
2322,2,Poor usability was the most noted intrinsic barrier of HIT. 
2323,2,"In part 2, we mapped the various factors of implementation to the integrated framework (the coordinates are shown as level of change-CFIR). "
2324,2,The key barriers to the extrinsic factors of HIT included health literacy and lack of digital skills (individual-characteristics of individuals). 
2325,2,"The key facilitators included physicians' suggestions, cooperation (interpersonal-process), integration into a workflow, and adequate management of data (organizational-inner setting). "
2326,2,The importance of health data security was identified. 
2327,2,Self-efficacy issues of patients and organizational readiness for implementation were highlighted.
2328,3,Internal factors of HIT and external human factors of implementation interplay in HIT implementation for chronic disease management. 
2329,3,"Strategies for improvement include ensuring HIT has a relative advantage over existing health care; tackling usability issues; and addressing underlying socioeconomic, interpersonal, and organizational conditions. "
2330,3,"Further research should focus on studying various stakeholders, such as service providers and administrative workforces; various disease populations, such as those with obesity and mental diseases; and various countries, including low- and middle-income countries."
2331,4,Pandemic-Triggered Adoption of Telehealth in Underserved Communities: Descriptive Study of Pre- and Postshutdown Trends
2332,0,The adoption of telehealth services has been a challenge in rural communities. 
2333,0,"The reasons for the slow adoption of such technology-driven services have been attributed to social norms, health care policies, and a lack of infrastructure to support the delivery of services. "
2334,0,"However, the COVID-19 pandemic-related shutdown of in-person health care services resulted in the usage of telehealth services as a necessity rather than a choice. "
2335,0,The pandemic also fast-tracked some needed legislation to allow medical cost reimbursement for remote examination and health care services. 
2336,0,"As services return to normalcy, it is important to examine whether the usage of telehealth services during the period of a shutdown has changed any of the trends in the acceptance of telehealth as a reliable alternative to traditional in-person health care services."
2337,1,We examined the Medicaid reimbursement data for the state of Alabama from March 2019 through June 2021. 
2338,1,"Selecting the telehealth service codes, we explored the adoption rates in 3 phases of the COVID-19 shutdown: prepandemic, pandemic before the rollout of mass vaccination, and pandemic after the rollout of mass vaccination."
2339,2,The trend in telemedicine claims had an opposite pattern to that in nontelemedicine claims across the 3 periods. 
2340,2,"The distribution of various characteristics of patients who used telemedicine (age group, gender, race, level of rurality, and service provider type) was different across the 3 periods. "
2341,2,Claims related to behavior and mental health had the highest rates of telemedicine usage after the onset of the pandemic. 
2342,2,The rate of telemedicine usage remained at a high level after the rollout of mass vaccination.
2343,3,"The current trends indicate that adoption of telehealth services is likely to increase postpandemic and that the consumers (patients), service providers, health care establishments, insurance companies, and state and local policies have changed their attitudes toward telehealth. "
2344,3,"An increase in the use of telehealth could help local and federal governments address the shortage of health care facilities and service providers in underserved communities, and patients can get the much-needed care in a timely and effective manner."
2345,4,A Review of Artificial Intelligence Applications in Hematology Management: Current Practices and Future Prospects
2346,0,Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have recently garnered a great deal of attention in the field of cancer research by making a noticeable contribution to the growth of predictive medicine and modern oncological practices. 
2347,0,Considerable focus has been particularly directed toward hematologic malignancies because of the complexity in detecting early symptoms. 
2348,0,Many patients with blood cancer do not get properly diagnosed until their cancer has reached an advanced stage with limited treatment prospects. 
2349,0,"Hence, the state-of-the-art revolves around the latest artificial intelligence (AI) applications in hematology management."
2350,1,"We searched a set of recognized databases (Scopus, Springer, and Web of Science) using a selected number of keywords. "
2351,1,We included studies written in English and published between 2015 and 2021. 
2352,1,"For each study, we identified the ML and DL techniques used and highlighted the performance of each model."
2353,2,"Using the aforementioned inclusion criteria, the search resulted in 567 papers, of which 144 were selected for review."
2354,3,"The current literature suggests that the application of AI in the field of hematology has generated impressive results in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment stages. "
2355,3,"Nevertheless, optimizing the patient's pathway to treatment requires a prior prediction of the malignancy based on the patient's symptoms or blood records, which is an area that has still not been properly investigated."
2356,4,Characterization of False or Misleading Fluoride Content on Instagram: Infodemiology Study
2357,0,Online false or misleading oral health-related content has been propagated on social media to deceive people against fluoride's economic and health benefits to prevent dental caries.
2358,1,"A total of 3863 posts ranked by users' total interaction and published between August 2016 and August 2021 were retrieved by CrowdTangle, of which 641 were screened to obtain 500 final posts. "
2359,1,"Subsequently, two independent investigators analyzed posts qualitatively to define their authors' interests, profile characteristics, content type, and sentiment. "
2360,1,"Latent Dirichlet allocation analysis topic modeling was then applied to find salient terms and topics related to false or misleading content, and their similarity was calculated through an intertopic distance map. "
2361,1,"Data were evaluated by descriptive analysis, the Mann-Whitney U test, the Cramer V test, and multiple logistic regression models."
2362,2,Most of the posts were categorized as misinformation and political misinformation. 
2363,2,"The overperforming score was positively associated with older messages (odds ratio [OR]=3.293, P<.001) and professional/political misinformation (OR=1.944, P=.05). "
2364,2,"In this context, time from publication, negative/neutral sentiment, author's profile linked to business/dental office/news agency, and social and political interests were related to the increment of performance of messages. "
2365,2,"Although political misinformation with negative/neutral sentiments was typically published by regular users, misinformation was linked to positive commercial posts. "
2366,2,"Overall messages focused on improving oral health habits, side effects, dentifrice containing natural ingredients, and fluoride-free products propaganda."
2367,3,"False or misleading fluoride-related content found on Instagram was predominantly produced by regular users motivated by social, psychological, and/or financial interests. "
2368,3,"However, higher engagement and spreading metrics were associated with political misinformation. "
2369,3,Most of the posts were related to the toxicity of fluoridated water and products frequently motivated by financial interests.
2370,4,The Potential of Current Noninvasive Wearable Technology for the Monitoring of Physiological Signals in the Management of Type 1 Diabetes: Literature Survey
2371,0,Monitoring glucose and other parameters in persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can enhance acute glycemic management and the diagnosis of long-term complications of the disease. 
2372,0,"For most persons living with T1D, the determination of insulin delivery is based on a single measured parameter-glucose. "
2373,0,"To date, wearable sensors exist that enable the seamless, noninvasive, and low-cost monitoring of multiple physiological parameters."
2374,1,"A list of physiological parameters, which can be monitored by using wearable sensors available in 2020, was compiled by a thorough review of the devices available in the market. "
2375,1,A literature survey was performed using search terms related to T1D combined with the identified physiological parameters. 
2376,1,"The selected publications were restricted to human studies, which had at least their abstracts available. "
2377,1,The PubMed and Scopus databases were interrogated. 
2378,1,"In total, 77 articles were retained and analyzed based on the following two axes: the reported relations between these parameters and T1D, which were found by comparing persons with T1D and healthy control participants, and the potential areas for T1D enhancement via the further analysis of the found relationships in studies working within T1D cohorts."
2379,2,"On the basis of our search methodology, 626 articles were returned, and after applying our exclusion criteria, 77 (12.3%) articles were retained. "
2380,2,"Physiological parameters with potential for monitoring by using noninvasive wearable devices in persons with T1D included those related to cardiac autonomic function, cardiorespiratory control balance and fitness, sudomotor function, and skin temperature. "
2381,2,"Cardiac autonomic function measures, particularly the indices of heart rate and heart rate variability, have been shown to be valuable in diagnosing and monitoring cardiac autonomic neuropathy and, potentially, predicting and detecting hypoglycemia. "
2382,2,"All identified physiological parameters were shown to be associated with some aspects of diabetes complications, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, as well as macrovascular disease, with capacity for early risk prediction. "
2383,2,"However, although they can be monitored by available wearable sensors, most studies have yet to adopt them, as opposed to using more conventional devices."
2384,3,"Wearable sensors have the potential to augment T1D sensing with additional, informative biomarkers, which can be monitored noninvasively, seamlessly, and continuously. "
2385,3,"However, significant challenges associated with measurement accuracy, removal of noise and motion artifacts, and smart decision-making exist. "
2386,3,"Consequently, research should focus on harvesting the information hidden in the complex data generated by wearable sensors and on developing models and smart decision strategies to optimize the incorporation of these novel inputs into T1D interventions."

2388,0,There is a lack of effectiveness studies when digital parent training programs are implemented in real-world practice. 
2389,0,The efficacy of the internet-based and telephone-assisted Finnish Strongest Families Smart Website (SFSW) parent training intervention on the disruptive behavior of 4-year-old children was studied in a randomized controlled trial setting in Southwest Finland between 2011 and 2013. 
2390,0,"After that, the intervention was implemented nationwide in child health clinics from 2015 onwards."
2391,1,The implementation group comprised 600 families who were recruited in the SFSW intervention between January 2015 and May 2017 in real-world implementation. 
2392,1,The RCT intervention group comprised 232 families who were recruited between October 2011 and November 2013. 
2393,1,The same demographic and child and parent measures were collected from both study groups and were compared using linear mixed-effect models for repeated measurements. 
2394,1,"The child psychopathology and functioning level were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) version 1.5-5 for preschool children, the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU), and a modified version of the Barkley Home Situations Questionnaire. "
2395,1,"Parenting skills were measured using the 31-item Parenting Scale and the shorter 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). "
2396,1,"The estimated child and parent outcomes were adjusted for CBCL externalizing scores at baseline, maternal education, duration of the behavior problems, and paternal age. "
2397,1,The baseline measurements of each outcome were used as covariates.
2398,2,"The implementation group was more likely to complete the intervention than the RCT intervention group (514/600, 85.7% vs 176/232, 75.9%, respectively; P<.001). "
2399,2,"There were no significant differences between the implementation and RCT intervention groups with regard to child measures, including CBCL externalizing score (-0.2, 95% CI -1.3 to 1.6; P=.83), total score (-0.7, 95% CI -3.0 to 4.5; P=.70), internalizing score (-0.3, 95% CI -1.0 to 1.6; P=.64), and ICU total score (-0.4, 95% Cl -1.9 to 1.2; P=.64). "
2400,2,"No significant difference was detected in the Parenting Scale total score (0.0, 95% Cl -0.1 to 0.1; P=.50), while DASS-21 total score differed nearly significantly (2.5, 95% Cl 0.0-5.1; P=.05), indicating better improvement in the implementation group."
2401,3,The internet-based and telephone-assisted SFSW parent training intervention was effectively implemented in real-world settings. 
2402,3,These findings have implications for addressing the unmet needs of children with disruptive behavior problems. 
2403,3,Our initiative could also provide a quick socially distanced solution for the considerable mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

2406,0,"The use of technology in the treatment of obesity is promising, but in the existing literature, there is considerable uncertainty regarding its efficacy. "
2407,0,"In this review, we included web- and mobile-based weight loss interventions that were implemented remotely in rehabilitation settings."
2408,1,Studies were searched from 9 databases. 
2409,1,"The inclusion criteria were as follows: population: age 18-65 years; intervention: physical activity-promoting web- and mobile-based distance weight loss interventions; comparison: control groups without the use of technology; outcome: changes in BMI, waist circumference, or body fat percentage; study design: randomized controlled trial. "
2410,1,The quality of the studies was assessed by 2 researchers. 
2411,1,"Meta-analysis was performed, and we also conducted a meta-regression analysis to evaluate the factors associated with the changes in body composition outcomes if statistical heterogeneity was observed."
2412,2,The meta-analysis included 30 studies. 
2413,2,The mean quality of the studies was 7 of 13 (SD 1.9; range 3-10). 
2414,2,"A statistically significant difference was observed in BMI (mean difference [MD] 0.83, 95% CI 0.51-1.15 kg/m(2); P<.001), waist circumference (MD 2.45, 95% CI 1.83-3.07 cm; P<.001), and body fat percentage (MD 1.07%, 95% CI 0.74%-1.41%; P<.001) in favor of the weight loss groups using web- or mobile-based interventions. "
2415,2,"Meta-regression analyses found an association between personal feedback and BMI (P=.04), but other factors did not play a role in explaining statistical heterogeneity."
2416,3,"Web- and mobile-based distance weight loss interventions significantly reduced BMI, waist circumference, and body fat percentage. "
2417,3,Future studies should focus on the comparability of the intervention content. 
2418,3,Future studies are needed to better understand weight loss and identify which components are essential in achieving it.

2441,4,Digitally Supported Lifestyle Intervention to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes Through Healthy Habits: Secondary Analysis of Long-Term User Engagement Trajectories in a Randomized Controlled Trial
2442,0,Digital health interventions may offer a scalable way to prevent type 2 diabetes (T2D) with minimal burden on health care systems by providing early support for healthy behaviors among adults at increased risk for T2D. 
2443,0,"However, ensuring continued engagement with digital solutions is a challenge impacting the expected effectiveness."
2444,1,"This is a secondary analysis of the StopDia (Stop Diabetes) study, an unblinded parallel 1-year randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of the BitHabit app alone or together with face-to-face group coaching in comparison with routine care in Finland in 2017-2019 among community-dwelling adults (aged 18 to 74 years) at an increased risk of T2D. "
2445,1,We used longitudinal data on usage from 1926 participants randomized to the digital intervention arms. 
2446,1,Latent class growth models were applied to identify user engagement trajectories with the app during the study. 
2447,1,Predictors for trajectory membership were examined with multinomial logistic regression models. 
2448,1,Analysis of covariance was used to investigate the association between trajectories and 12-month changes in T2D risk factors.
2449,2,"More than half (1022/1926, 53.1%) of the participants continued to use the app throughout the 12-month intervention. "
2450,2,"The following 4 user engagement trajectories were identified: terminated usage (904/1926, 46.9%), weekly usage (731/1926, 38.0%), twice weekly usage (208/1926, 10.8%), and daily usage (83/1926, 4.3%). "
2451,2,"Active app use during the first month, higher net promoter score after the first 1 to 2 months of use, older age, and better quality of diet at baseline increased the odds of belonging to the continued usage trajectories. "
2452,2,"Compared with other trajectories, daily usage was associated with a higher increase in diet quality and a more pronounced decrease in BMI and waist circumference at 12 months."
2453,3,"Distinct long-term usage trajectories of the BitHabit app were identified, and individual predictors for belonging to different trajectory groups were found. "
2454,3,"These findings highlight the need for being able to identify individuals likely to disengage from interventions early on, and could be used to inform the development of future adaptive interventions."
2455,4,The Effect of Online Health Information Seeking on Physician-Patient Relationships: Systematic Review
2456,0,The internet has now become part of human life and is constantly changing people's way of life. 
2457,0,"With the increasing popularity of online health information (OHI), it has been found that OHI can affect the physician-patient relationship by influencing patient behaviors."
2458,1,"Literature retrieval was conducted on 4 databases (Web of Science, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, SinoMed), and the time limit for literature publication was before August 1, 2021."
2459,2,We selected 53 target papers (42 [79%] English papers and 11 [21%] Chinese papers) that met the inclusion criteria. 
2460,2,"Of these, 31 (58%) papers believe that patients' OHI behavior can enable them to participate in their own medical care, improve patient compliance, and improve the physician-patient relationship. "
2461,2,"In addition, 14 (26%) papers maintain a neutral attitude, some believing that OHI behavior has no significant effect on doctors and patients and others believing that due to changes in the factors affecting OHI behavior, they will have a negative or a positive impact. "
2462,2,"Furthermore, 8 (15%) papers believe that OHI search behavior has a negative impact on doctors and patients, while 6 (11%) papers show that OHI reduces Chinese patients' trust in doctors."
2463,3,"Our main findings showed that (1) OHI-seeking behavior has an impact on patients' psychology, behavior, and evaluation of doctors; (2) whether patients choose to discuss OHI with doctors has different effects on the physician-patient relationship; and (3) the negative impact of OHI on China's internet users is worthy of attention. "
2464,3,"Due to the low quality of OHI, poor health information literacy, short physician-patient communication time, and various types of negative news, patients' trust in doctors has declined, thus affecting the physician-patient relationship. "
2465,3,Improvement of people's health information literacy and the quality of OHI are important factors that promote the positive impact of OHI on the physician-patient relationship.
2466,4,The Effect of Digital Health Interventions on Parents Mental Health Literacy and Help Seeking for Their Childs Mental Health Problem: Systematic Review
2467,0,Many children with mental health problems do not receive professional help. 
2468,0,"Despite the frequent use of digital health interventions (DHIs) such as websites or web-based service navigation platforms, their effects on parents' mental health literacy, help seeking, or uptake of professional services are unclear."
2469,1,"Databases, including CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE OVID, PsycINFO, and PubMed (2000-2020), were accessed. "
2470,1,"Studies were included if they evaluated quantitative changes in mental health literacy, help seeking, or the uptake of services by parents of children with mental health problems. "
2471,1,"Theoretical frameworks, sample sizes, participant demographics, recruitment, interventions, DHI use, results, and health economic measures were used for data extraction."
2472,2,"Of the 11,379 search results, 5 (0.04%) studies met the inclusion criteria. "
2473,2,One randomized controlled trial found the reduced uptake of services after using a DHI coupled with a telephone coach for a child's behavioral problem. 
2474,2,"Of 3 studies, 2 (66.7%) found statistically significant improvement in mental health literacy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder but had no control group. "
2475,2,One study found nonsignificant improvement in mental health literacy and help-seeking attitudes toward anxiety and depression compared with those in active controls. 
2476,2,All studies were rated as having a high or serious risk of bias. 
2477,2,"Search results were affected because of a single reviewer screening articles, overall low-quality studies, and a lack of consistent nomenclature."
2478,3,"There is no high-quality evidence that DHIs can improve parents' mental health literacy, help seeking, or uptake of services. "
2479,3,More research is needed to evaluate DHIs by using rigorous study designs and consistent measures.
2480,4,"So Many Choices, How Do I Choose? Considerations for Selecting Digital Health Interventions to Support Immunization Confidence and Demand"
2481,0,Digital health interventions have revolutionized multiple sclerosis (MS) care by supporting people with MS to better self-manage their disease. 
2482,0,"It is now understood that the technological elements that comprise this category of digital health interventions can influence participant engagement in self-management programs, and people with MS can experience significant barriers, influenced by these elements, to remaining engaged during a period of learning. "
2483,0,It is essential to explore the influence of technological elements in mitigating attrition.
2484,1,We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs (n=32) describing digital health self-management interventions for people with MS. 
2485,1,"We analyzed attrition in included studies, using a random-effects model and meta-regression to measure the association between potential moderators."
2486,2,"There were no measured differences in attrition between the intervention and control arms; however, some of the heterogeneity observed was explained by the composite technological element score. "
2487,2,"The pooled attrition rates for the intervention and control arms were 14.7% and 15.6%, respectively."
2488,3,This paper provides insight into the technological composition of digital health interventions designed for people with MS and describes the degree of attrition in both study arms. 
2489,3,"This paper will aid in the design of future studies in this area, particularly for digital health interventions of this type."
2490,4,Implementation of eHealth to Support Assessment and Decision-making for Residents With Dementia in Long-term Care: Systematic Review
2491,0,"As dementia progresses, symptoms and concerns increase, causing considerable distress for the person and their caregiver. "
2492,0,The integration of care between care homes and health care services is vital to meet increasing care needs and maintain quality of life. 
2493,0,"However, care home access to high-quality health care is inequitable. "
2494,0,"eHealth can facilitate this by supporting remote specialist input on care processes, such as clinical assessment and decision-making, and streamlining care on site. "
2495,0,How to best implement eHealth in the care home setting is unclear.
2496,1,"A systematic search of Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and CINAHL was conducted to identify studies published between 2000 and 2020. "
2497,1,Studies were eligible if they focused on eHealth interventions to improve treatment and care assessment or decision-making for residents with dementia in care homes. 
2498,1,Data were thematically analyzed and deductively mapped onto the 6 constructs of the adapted Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). 
2499,1,The results are presented as a narrative synthesis.
2500,2,"A total of 29 studies were included, focusing on a variety of eHealth interventions, including remote video consultations and clinical decision support tools. "
2501,2,Key factors that influenced eHealth implementation were identified across all 6 constructs of the CFIR. 
2502,2,"Most concerned the inner setting construct on requirements for implementation in the care home, such as providing a conducive learning climate, engaged leadership, and sufficient training and resources. "
2503,2,A total of 4 novel subconstructs were identified to inform the implementation requirements to meet resident needs and engage end users.
2504,3,"Implementing eHealth in care homes for people with dementia is multifactorial and complex, involving interaction between residents, staff, and organizations. "
2505,3,It requires an emphasis on the needs of residents and the engagement of end users in the implementation process. 
2506,3,A novel conceptual model of the key factors was developed and translated into 18 practical recommendations on the implementation of eHealth in long-term care to guide implementers or innovators in care homes. 
2507,3,Successful implementation of eHealth is required to maximize uptake and drive improvements in integrated health and social care.
2508,4,Real-world Implementation of a Smartphone-Based Psychoeducation Program for Bipolar Disorder: Observational Ecological Study
2509,0,SIMPLe is an internet-delivered self-management mobile app for bipolar disorder (BD) designed to combine technology with evidence-based interventions and facilitate access to psychoeducational content. 
2510,0,The SIMPLe app was launched to the real world to make it available worldwide within the context of BD treatment.
2511,1,This was an observational ecological study in which we pooled available data from a real-world implementation of the SIMPLe app. 
2512,1,"Participation was open on the project website, and the data-collection sources were a web-based questionnaire on clinical data and treatment history administered at inclusion and at 6 months, subjective data gathered through continuous app use, and the use patterns captured by the app server. "
2513,1,"Characteristics and engagement of regular users, occasional users, and no users were compared using 2-tailed t tests or analysis of variance or their nonparametric equivalent. "
2514,1,Survival analysis and risk functions were applied to regular users' data to examine and compare use and user retention. 
2515,1,"In addition, a user evaluation analysis was performed based on satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and reasons to discontinue app use."
2516,2,"We included 503 participants with data collected between 2016 and 2018, of whom 77.5% (n=390) used the app. "
2517,2,"Among the app users, 44.4% (173/390) completed the follow-up assessment, and data from these participants were used in our analyses. "
2518,2,Engagement declined gradually over the first 6 months of use. 
2519,2,The probability of retention of the regular users after 1 month of app use was 67.4% (263/390; 95% CI 62.7%-72.4%). 
2520,2,"Age (P=.002), time passed since illness onset (P<.001), and years since diagnosis of BD (P=.048) correlate with retention duration. "
2521,2,"In addition, participants who had been diagnosed with BD for longer used the app on more days (mean 97.73, SD 69.15 days; P=.002) than those who had had a more recent onset (mean 66.49, SD 66.18 days; P=.002) or those who had been diagnosed more recently (mean 73.45, SD 66 days; P=.01)."
2522,3,The user retention rate of the app decreased rapidly after each month until reaching only one-third of the users at 6 months. 
2523,3,There exists a strong association between age and app engagement of individuals with BD. 
2524,3,"Other variables such as years lived with BD, diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and taking antipsychotics seem relevant as well. "
2525,3,"Understanding these associations can help in the definition of the most suitable user profiles for predicting trends of engagement, optimization of app prescription, and management."
2526,4,Improving Diabetes-Related Biomedical Literature Exploration in the Clinical Decision-making Process via Interactive Classification and Topic Discovery: Methodology Development Study
2527,0,The amount of available textual health data such as scientific and biomedical literature is constantly growing and becoming more and more challenging for health professionals to properly summarize those data and practice evidence-based clinical decision making. 
2528,0,"Moreover, the exploration of unstructured health text data is challenging for professionals without computer science knowledge due to limited time, resources, and skills. "
2529,0,"Current tools to explore text data lack ease of use, require high computational efforts, and incorporate domain knowledge and focus on topics of interest with difficulty."
2530,1,"The methodology consists of 4 parts: (1) a novel interpretable hierarchical clustering of documents where each node is defined by headwords (words that best represent the documents in the node), (2) an efficient classification system to target topics, (3) minimized user interaction effort through active learning, and (4) a visual user interface. "
2531,1,"We evaluated our approach on 50,911 diabetes-related abstracts providing a hierarchical Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) structure, a unique identifier for a topic. "
2532,1,Hierarchical clustering performance was compared against the implementation in the machine learning library scikit-learn. 
2533,1,"On a subset of 2000 randomly chosen diabetes abstracts, our active learning strategy was compared against 3 other strategies: random selection of training instances, uncertainty sampling that chooses instances about which the model is most uncertain, and an expected gradient length strategy based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs)."
2534,2,"For the hierarchical clustering performance, we achieved an F1 score of 0.73 compared to 0.76 achieved by scikit-learn. "
2535,2,"Concerning active learning performance, after 200 chosen training samples based on these strategies, the weighted F1 score of all MeSH codes resulted in a satisfying 0.62 F1 score using our approach, 0.61 using the uncertainty strategy, 0.63 using the CNN, and 0.45 using the random strategy. "
2536,2,"Moreover, our methodology showed a constant low memory use with increased number of documents."
2537,3,We proposed an easy-to-use tool for health professionals with limited computer science knowledge who combine their domain knowledge with topic exploration and target specific topics of interest while improving transparency. 
2538,3,"Furthermore, our approach is memory efficient and highly parallelizable, making it interesting for large Big Data sets. "
2539,3,This approach can be used by health professionals to gain deep insights into biomedical literature to ultimately improve the evidence-based clinical decision making process.
2540,4,"Barriers and Facilitators to Accessing Digital Health Tools Faced by South Asian Canadians in Surrey, British Columbia: Community-Based Participatory Action Exploration Using Photovoice"
2541,0,South Asian community members in Canada experience a higher burden of chronic disease than the general population. 
2542,0,Digital health innovations provide a significant opportunity to address various health care challenges such as supporting patients in their disease self-management. 
2543,0,"However, South Asian community members are less likely to use digital tools for their health and face significant barriers in accessing them because of language or cultural factors."
2544,1,This study used a qualitative community-based participatory action research approach. 
2545,1,"Residents from Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, who spoke 1 of 4 South Asian languages (Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, or Tamil) were invited to participate in focus group discussions. "
2546,1,A subsample of the participants were invited to use photovoice methods in greater depth to explore the research topics.
2547,2,"A total of 197 participants consented to the focus group discussions, with 12 (6.1%) participating in the photovoice phase. "
2548,2,"The findings revealed several key obstacles (older age, lack of education, and poor digital health literacy) and facilitators (social support from family or community members and positive attitudes toward technology) to using digital health tools."
2549,3,The results support the value of using a community-based participatory action research approach and photovoice methods to engage the South Asian community in Canada to better understand digital health competencies and needs. 
2550,3,"There were several important implications for policy makers and future research, such as continued engagement of community leaders by health care providers and administrators to learn about attitudes and preferences."
2551,4,Digital Storytelling for Health-Related Outcomes in Older Adults: Systematic Review
2552,0,Older adults face a unique set of challenges and may experience a range of psychological comorbidities. 
2553,0,Digital storytelling is an emerging tool for sharing and recording lived experiences and may have the potential to support well-being but is yet to be systematically reviewed for use among older adults.
2554,1,We systematically searched electronic databases to identify articles published in English that reported on at least one health-related outcome of digital storytelling for participants aged >= 60 years. 
2555,1,Data were extracted and synthesized using qualitative content analysis and summarized in tables. 
2556,1,The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.
2557,2,A total of 8 studies were included in the review. 
2558,2,"Participants were primarily community-dwelling older adults living with dementia, involving family caregivers and professional care staff. "
2559,2,"Studies have taken various approaches to digital storytelling and reported diverse benefits associated with digital storytelling, including improvements in mood, memory, social engagement, and quality of relationships. "
2560,2,"Although the potential for implementation was not widely examined, some studies have presented evidence for acceptability and feasibility. "
2561,2,"Generally, studies were of high quality, despite the absence of comparator groups and confounder analyses."
2562,3,"The evidence reviewed suggests that despite the various approaches taken, digital storytelling shows promise as an effective approach for supporting well-being in older adults."
2563,4,Engagement Strategies to Improve Adherence and Retention in Web-Based Mindfulness Programs: Systematic Review
2564,0,Web-based mindfulness programs may be beneficial in improving the well-being outcomes of those living with chronic illnesses. 
2565,0,"Adherence to programs is a key indicator in improving outcomes; however, with the digitization of programs, it is necessary to enhance engagement and encourage people to return to digital health platforms. "
2566,0,More information is needed on how engagement strategies have been used in web-based mindfulness programs to encourage adherence.
2567,1,"A narrative systematic review was conducted across the MEDLINE Complete, CINAHL Complete, APA PsycINFO, and Embase databases and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. "
2568,1,"Articles were screened using the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome framework. "
2569,1,Adults aged >18 years with chronic health conditions were included in the study. 
2570,1,"Mindfulness interventions, including those in combination with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, delivered on the web through the internet or smartphone technology were included. "
2571,1,Interventions lasted at least 2 weeks. 
2572,1,Studies with a randomized controlled trial design or a pilot randomized controlled trial design were included. 
2573,1,"Engagement strategies, including web-based program features and facilitator-led strategies, adherence, and retention, were included."
2574,2,"A total of 1265 articles were screened, of which 19 were relevant and were included in the review. "
2575,2,"On average, 70.98% (2258/3181) of the study participants were women with a mean age of 46 (SD 13) years. "
2576,2,"Most commonly, mindfulness programs were delivered to people living with mental health conditions (8/19, 42%). "
2577,2,"Of the 19 studies, 8 (42%) used only program features to encourage adherence, 5 (26%) used facilitator-led strategies, and 6 (32%) used a combination of the two. "
2578,2,"Encouraging program adherence was the most common engagement strategy used, which was used in 77% (10/13) of the facilitator-led studies and 57% (8/14) of the program feature studies. "
2579,2,"Nearly two-thirds (63%) of the studies provided a definition of adherence, which varied between 50% and 100% completion across studies. "
2580,2,The overall mean participant compliance to the mindfulness programs was 56% (SD 15%). 
2581,2,"Most studies (10/19, 53%) had a long-term follow-up, with the most common follow-up period being 12 weeks after intervention (3/10, 30%). "
2582,2,"After the intervention, the mean retention was 78% (SD 15%)."
2583,3,Engagement strategies in web-based mindfulness programs comprise reminders to use the program. 
2584,3,"Other features may be suitable for encouraging adherence to interventions, and a facilitator-led component may result in higher retention. "
2585,3,"There is variance in the way adherence is measured, and intervention lengths and follow-up periods are inconsistent. "
2586,3,More thorough reporting and a standardized framework for measuring adherence are needed to more accurately assess adherence and engagement strategies.
2587,4,Factors Influencing Willingness to Share Health Misinformation Videos on the Internet: Web-Based Survey
2588,0,The rapidly evolving digital environment of the social media era has increased the reach of both quality health information and misinformation. 
2589,0,"Platforms such as YouTube enable easy sharing of attractive, if not always evidence-based, videos with large personal networks and the public. "
2590,0,"Although much research has focused on characterizing health misinformation on the internet, it has not sufficiently focused on describing and measuring individuals' information competencies that build resilience."
2591,1,A web-based survey methodology with 150 individuals across the United States was used. 
2592,1,Participants were asked to watch a YouTube excerpt from a morning TV show featuring a wellness pharmacy representative promoting an immunity-boosting dietary supplement produced by his company; answer questions about the video and report whether they would share it with a cousin who was frequently sick; and complete instruments pertaining to the information competencies outlined in the objectives.
2593,2,"Most participants (105/150, 70%) said that they would share the video with their cousins. "
2594,2,"Their confidence in the supplement would be further boosted by a friend's recommendations, positive reviews on a crowdsourcing website, and statements of uncited effectiveness studies on the producer's website. "
2595,2,"Although all information literacy competencies analyzed in this study had a statistically significant relationship with the outcome, each competency was also highly correlated with the others. "
2596,2,"Information literacy and interpersonal trust independently predicted the largest amount of variance in the intention to share the video (17% and 16%, respectively). "
2597,2,Interpersonal trust was negatively related to the willingness to share the video. 
2598,2,Science literacy explained 7% of the variance.
2599,3,People are vulnerable to web-based misinformation and are likely to propagate it on the internet. 
2600,3,Information literacy and science literacy are associated with less vulnerability to misinformation and a lower propensity to spread it. 
2601,3,"Of the two, information literacy holds a greater promise as an intervention target. "
2602,3,Understanding the role of different kinds of trust in information sharing merits further research.
2603,4,"An Integrated, Scalable, Electronic Video Consent Process to Power Precision Health Research: Large, Population-Based, Cohort Implementation and Scalability Study"
2604,0,Obtaining explicit consent from patients to use their remnant biological samples and deidentified clinical data for research is essential for advancing precision medicine.
2605,1,"The University of California, Los Angeles, implemented the use of innovative electronic consent videos as the primary recruitment tool for precision health research. "
2606,1,"The consent videos targeted patients aged >= 18 years across ambulatory clinical laboratories, perioperative settings, and hospital settings. "
2607,1,Each of these major areas had slightly different workflows and patient populations. 
2608,1,"Sociodemographic information, comorbidity data, health utilization data (ambulatory visits, emergency room visits, and hospital admissions), and consent decision data were collected."
2609,2,The consenting approach proved scalable across 22 clinical sites (hospital and ambulatory settings). 
2610,2,"Over 40,000 participants completed the consent process at a rate of 800 to 1000 patients per week over a 2-year time period. "
2611,2,"Participants were representative of the adult University of California, Los Angeles, Health population. "
2612,2,"The opt-in rates in the perioperative (16,500/22,519, 73.3%) and ambulatory clinics (2308/3390, 68.1%) were higher than those in clinical laboratories (7506/14,235, 52.7%; P<.001). "
2613,2,Patients with higher medical acuity were more likely to opt in. 
2614,2,"The multivariate analyses showed that African American (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.49-0.58; P<.001), Asian (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.68-0.77; P<.001), and multiple-race populations (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.69-0.77; P<.001) were less likely to participate than White individuals."
2615,3,"This is one of the few large-scale, electronic video-based consent implementation programs that reports a 65.5% (26,314/40,144) average overall opt-in rate across a large academic health system. "
2616,3,This rate is higher than those previously reported for email (3.6%) and electronic biobank (50%) informed consent rates. 
2617,3,This study demonstrates a scalable recruitment approach for population health research.
2618,4,Effects of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Harmful Alcohol Use and Alcohol Dependence as Self-help or With Therapist Guidance: Three-Armed Randomized Trial
2619,0,Alcohol use is a major contributor to health loss. 
2620,0,Many persons with harmful use or alcohol dependence do not obtain treatment because of limited availability or stigma They may use internet-based interventions as an alternative way of obtaining support. 
2621,0,"Internet-based interventions have previously been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption in studies that included hazardous use; however, few studies have been conducted with a specific focus on harmful use or alcohol dependence. "
2622,0,The importance of therapist guidance in internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) programs is still unclear.
2623,1,A three-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare therapist-guided ICBT and self-help ICBT with an information-only control condition. 
2624,1,"Swedish-speaking adult internet users with alcohol dependence (3 or more International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision criteria) or harmful alcohol use (alcohol use disorder identification test>15) were included in the study. "
2625,1,"Participants in the therapist-guided ICBT and self-help ICBT groups had 12-week access to a program consisting of 5 main modules, as well as a drinking calendar with automatic feedback. "
2626,1,Guidance was given by experienced therapists trained in motivational interviewing. 
2627,1,The primary outcome measure was weekly alcohol consumption in standard drinks (12 g of ethanol). 
2628,1,"Secondary outcomes were alcohol-related problems measured using the total alcohol use disorder identification test-score, diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence and alcohol use disorder, depression, anxiety, health, readiness to change, and access to other treatments or support. "
2629,1,Follow-up was conducted 3 (posttreatment) and 6 months after recruitment.
2630,2,"During the recruitment period, from March 2015 to March 2017, 1169 participants were included. "
2631,2,"Participants had a mean age of 45 (SD 13) years, and 56.72% (663/1169) were women. "
2632,2,"At the 3-month follow-up, the therapist-guided ICBT and control groups differed significantly in weekly alcohol consumption (-3.84, 95% Cl -6.53 to -1.16; t(417) =2.81; P=.005; Cohen d=0.27). "
2633,2,"No significant differences were found in weekly alcohol consumption between the self-help ICBT group and the therapist-guided ICBT at 3 months, between the self-help ICBT and the control group at 3 months, or between any of the groups at the 6-month follow-up. "
2634,2,"A limitation of the study was the large number of participants who were completely lost to follow-up (477/1169, 40.8%)."
2635,3,"In this study, a therapist-guided ICBT program was not found to be more effective than the same program in a self-help ICBT version for reducing alcohol consumption or other alcohol-related outcomes. "
2636,3,"In the short run, therapist-guided ICBT was more effective than information. "
2637,3,Only some internet help-seekers may need a multisession program and therapist guidance to change their drinking when they use internet-based interventions.
2638,4,Identifying App-Based Meditation Habits and the Associated Mental Health Benefits: Longitudinal Observational Study
2639,0,"Behavioral habits are often initiated by contextual cues that occur at approximately the same time each day; so, it may be possible to identify a reflexive habit based on the temporal similarity of repeated daily behavior. "
2640,0,"Mobile health tools provide the detailed, longitudinal data necessary for constructing such an indicator of reflexive habits, which can improve our understanding of habit formation and help design more effective mobile health interventions for promoting healthier habits."
2641,1,"App-use data from June 2019 to June 2020 were analyzed for 2771 paying subscribers of a meditation mobile phone app, of whom 86.06% (2359/2771) were female, 72.61% (2012/2771) were college educated, 86.29% (2391/2771) were White, and 60.71% (1664/2771) were employed full-time. "
2642,1,Participants volunteered to complete a survey assessing their perceived changes in physical and mental health from using the app. 
2643,1,"Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the ability of the temporal similarity measure to predict future behavior, and variable importance statistics from random forest models were used to corroborate these findings. "
2644,1,Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between temporal similarity and self-reported physical and mental health benefits.
2645,2,"The temporal similarity of users' daily app use before completing the survey, as measured by the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance between app use on consecutive days, significantly predicted app use at 28 days and at 6 months after the survey, even after controlling for users' demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, total app sessions, duration of app use, and number of days with any app use. "
2646,2,"In addition, the temporal similarity measure significantly increased in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for models predicting any future app use in 28 days (AUC=0.868 with DTW and 0.850 without DTW; P<.001) and for models predicting any app use in 6 months (AUC=0.821 with DTW and 0.802 without DTW; P<.001). "
2647,2,"Finally, a 1% increase in the temporal similarity of users' daily meditation practice with the app over 6 weeks before the survey was associated with increased odds of reporting mental health improvements, with an odds ratio of 2.94 (95% CI 1.832-6.369)."
2648,3,"The temporal similarity of the meditation app use was a significant predictor of future behavior, which suggests that this measure can identify reflexive meditation habits. "
2649,3,"In addition, temporal similarity was associated with greater perceived mental health benefits, which demonstrates that additional mental health benefits may be derived from forming reflexive meditation habits."
2650,4,"A Human, Organization, and Technology Perspective on Patients Experiences of a Chat-Based and Automated Medical History-Taking Service in Primary Health Care: Interview Study Among Primary Care Patients"
2651,0,The use of e-visits in health care is progressing rapidly worldwide. 
2652,0,"To date, studies on the advantages and disadvantages of e-consultations in the form of chat services for all inquiries in primary care have focused on the perspective of health care professionals (HCPs) rather than those of end users (patients)."
2653,1,"Overall, 25 individual interviews were conducted with patients in the catchment areas of 5 primary care centers (PCCs) in Sweden that tested a chat-based and automated medical history-taking service for all types of patient inquiries. "
2654,1,"The semistructured interviews were transcribed verbatim before content analysis using inductive and deductive strategies, the latter including an unconstrained matrix of human, organization, and technology perspectives."
2655,2,"The service provided an easily managed way for patients to make written contact with HCPs, which was considered beneficial for some patients and issues but less suitable for others (acute or more complex cases). "
2656,2,The automated medical history-taking service was perceived as having potential but still derived from what HCPs need to know and how they address and communicate health and health care issues. 
2657,2,"Technical skills were not considered as necessary for a mobile phone chat as for handling a computer; however, patients still expressed concern for people with less digital literacy. "
2658,2,"The opportunity to take one's time and reflect on one's situation before answering questions from the HCPs was found to reduce stress and prevent errors, and patients speculated that it might be the same for the HCPs on the other end of the system. "
2659,2,"Patients appreciated the ability to have a conversation from almost anywhere, even from places not suitable for telephone calls. "
2660,2,"The asynchronicity of the chat service allowed the patients to take more control of the conversation and initiate a chat at any time at their own convenience; however, it could also lead to lengthy conversations where a single issue in the worst cases could take days to close. "
2661,2,"The opportunity to upload photographs made some visits to the PCC redundant, which would otherwise have been necessary if the ordinary telephone service had been used, saving patients both time and money."
2662,3,"Patients generally had a positive attitude toward e-visits in primary care and were generally pleased with the prospects of the digital tool tested, somewhat more with the actual chat than with the automated history-taking system preceding the chat. "
2663,3,"Although patients expect their PCC to offer a range of different means of communication, the human, organization, and technology analysis revealed a need for more extensive (end) user experience design in the further development of the chat service."
2664,4,The National COVID Cohort Collaborative: Analyses of Original and Computationally Derived Electronic Health Record Data
2665,0,"Computationally derived (""synthetic"") data can enable the creation and analysis of clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic data as if they were the original electronic health record data. "
2666,0,Synthetic data can support data sharing to answer critical research questions to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
2667,1,"We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's instance of MDClone, a big data platform with data-synthesizing capabilities (MDClone Ltd). "
2668,1,"We downloaded electronic health record data from 34 National COVID Cohort Collaborative institutional partners and tested three use cases, including (1) exploring the distributions of key features of the COVID-19-positive cohort; (2) training and testing predictive models for assessing the risk of admission among these patients; and (3) determining geospatial and temporal COVID-19-related measures and outcomes, and constructing their epidemic curves. "
2669,1,"We compared the results from synthetic data to those from original data using traditional statistics, machine learning approaches, and temporal and spatial representations of the data."
2670,2,"For each use case, the results of the synthetic data analyses successfully mimicked those of the original data such that the distributions of the data were similar and the predictive models demonstrated comparable performance. "
2671,2,"Although the synthetic and original data yielded overall nearly the same results, there were exceptions that included an odds ratio on either side of the null in multivariable analyses (0.97 vs 1.01) and differences in the magnitude of epidemic curves constructed for zip codes with low population counts."
2672,3,"This paper presents the results of each use case and outlines key considerations for the use of synthetic data, examining their role in collaborative research for faster insights."
2673,4,Finding Relevant Psychoeducation Content for Adolescents Experiencing Symptoms of Depression: Content Analysis of User-Generated Online Texts
2674,0,"Symptoms of depression are frequent in youth and may develop into more severe mood disorders, suggesting interventions should take place during adolescence. "
2675,0,"However, young people tend not to share mental problems with friends, family, caregivers, or professionals. "
2676,0,Many receive misleading information when searching the internet. 
2677,0,"Among several attempts to create mental health services for adolescents, technological information platforms based on psychoeducation show promising results. "
2678,0,Such development rests on established theories and therapeutic models. 
2679,0,"To fulfill the therapeutic potential of psychoeducation in health technologies, we lack data-driven research on young peoples'demand for information about depression."
2680,1,"We conducted a qualitative, constructivist-oriented content analysis of questions submitted by adolescents aged 16-20 years to an online public information service. "
2681,1,A sample of 100 posts containing questions on depression were randomly selected from a total of 870. 
2682,1,"For analysis, we developed an a priori codebook from the main information topics of existing psychoeducational programs on youth depression. "
2683,1,The distribution of topic prevalence in the total volume of posts containing questions on depression was calculated.
2684,2,"With a 95% confidence level and a +/- 9.2% margin of error, the distribution analysis revealed the following categories to be the most prevalent among adolescents seeking advice about depression: self-management (33%, 61/180), etiology (20%, 36/180), and therapy (20%, 36/180). "
2685,2,"Self-management concerned subcategories on coping in general and how to open to friends, family, and caregivers. "
2686,2,"The therapy topic concerned therapy options, prognosis, where to seek help, and how to open up to a professional. "
2687,2,We also found young people dichotomizing therapy and self-management as opposite entities. 
2688,2,The etiology topic concerned stressors and risk factors. 
2689,2,"The diagnosis category was less frequently referred to (9%, 17/180)."
2690,3,"Self-management, etiology, and therapy are the most prevalent categories among adolescents seeking advice about depression. "
2691,3,Young people also dichotomize therapy and self-management as opposite entities. 
2692,3,"Future research should focus on measures to promote self-management, measures to stimulate expectations of self-efficacy, information about etiology, and information about diagnosis to improve self-monitoring skills, enhancing relapse prevention."
2693,4,Patterns for Patient Engagement with the Hypertension Management and Effects of Electronic Health Care Provider Follow-up on These Patterns: Cluster Analysis
2694,0,Hypertension is a long-term medical condition. 
2695,0,Electronic and mobile health care services can help patients to self-manage this condition. 
2696,0,"However, not all management is effective, possibly due to different levels of patient engagement (PE) with health care services. "
2697,0,Health care provider follow-up is an intervention to promote PE and blood pressure (BP) control.
2698,1,PE was represented as the number of days that a patient recorded self-measured BP per week. 
2699,1,The study period was the first 4 weeks for a patient to engage in the hypertension management service. 
2700,1,K-means algorithm was used to group patients by PE. 
2701,1,"There was compliance follow-up, regular follow-up, and abnormal follow-up in management. "
2702,1,"The follow-up effect was calculated by the change in PE (CPE) and the change in systolic blood pressure (CSBP, SBP) before and after each follow-up. "
2703,1,"Chi-square tests and z scores were used to ascertain the distribution of gender, age, education level, SBP, and the number of follow-ups in each cluster. "
2704,1,The follow-up effect was identified by analysis of variances. 
2705,1,"Once a significant effect was detected, Bonferroni multiple comparisons were further conducted to identify the difference between 2 clusters."
2706,2,"Patients were grouped into 4 clusters according to PE: (1) PE started low and dropped even lower (PELL), (2) PE started high and remained high (PEHH), (3) PE started high and dropped to low (PEHL), and (4) PE started low and rose to high (PELH). "
2707,2,Significantly more patients over 60 years old were found in the PEHH cluster (P <=.05). 
2708,2,Abnormal follow-up was significantly less frequent (P <=.05) in the PELL cluster. 
2709,2,Compliance follow-up and regular follow-up can improve PE. 
2710,2,"In the clusters of PEHH and PELH, the improvement in PE in the first 3 weeks and the decrease in SBP in all 4 weeks were significant after follow-up. "
2711,2,The SBP of the clusters of PELL and PELH decreased more (-6.1 mmHg and -8.4 mmHg) after follow-up in the first week.
2712,3,Four distinct PE patterns were identified for patients engaging in the hypertension self-management app. 
2713,3,Patients aged over 60 years had higher PE in terms of recording self-measured BP using the app. 
2714,3,"Once SBP reduced, patients with low PE tended to stop using the app, and a continued decline in PE occurred simultaneously with the increase in SBP. "
2715,3,The duration and depth of the effect of health care provider follow-up were more significant in patients with high or increased engagement after follow-up.
2716,4,Public Adoption of and Trust in the NHS COVID-19 Contact Tracing App in the United Kingdom: Quantitative Online Survey Study
2717,0,Digital contact tracing is employed to monitor and manage the spread of COVID-19. 
2718,0,"However, to be effective the system must be adopted by a substantial proportion of the population. "
2719,0,"Studies of mostly hypothetical contact tracing apps show generally high acceptance, but little is known about the drivers and barriers to adoption of deployed systems."
2720,1,An online survey based on the extended Technology Acceptance Model with the added factor of trust was carried out with a representative sample of the UK population. 
2721,1,"Statistical analysis showed adoption rates, attitudes toward and trust in the app, and compliance with self-isolation advice and highlighted differences for vulnerable populations (ie, older adults aged 65 years and over and members of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic [BAME] communities)."
2722,2,A total of 1001 participants took part in the study. 
2723,2,"Around half of the participants who had heard of the NHS COVID-19 mobile phone app (490/963, 50.9%; 95% CI 47.8%-54.0%) had downloaded and kept the app, but more than one-third (345/963, 35.8%; 95% CI 32.8%-38.8%) either did not intend to download it or had deleted it. "
2724,2,"Significantly more BAME respondents than White respondents had deleted the app (16/115, 13.9%; 95% CI 11.8%-16.0%, vs 65/876, 7.4%; 95% CI 5.8%-9.0%), and significantly more older adults 65 years and over than those under 65 years did not intend to download it (44/127, 34.6%; 95% CI 31.7%-37.5%, vs 220/874, 25.2%; 95% CI 22.5%-27.9%). "
2725,2,"Broadly, one of the reasons for uptake was to help the NHS and other people, especially among older adults, although significantly fewer BAME participants agreed that they did so to help the NHS. "
2726,2,Reported compliance with received notifications to self-isolate was high but was significantly lower than reported intended compliance without received notifications. 
2727,2,"Only one-fifth (136/699, 19.5%; 95% CI 17.0%-22.0%) of participants understood that the decision to send self-isolation notifications was automated by the app. "
2728,2,"There were a range of significantly more negative views among BAME participants, including lower trust in the NHS, while older adults were often significantly more positive. "
2729,2,Respondents without the app reported significantly lower trust and more negative views toward the app and were less likely to report that they understood how the app works.
2730,3,"While compliance on the part of the approximately 50% of participants who had the app was fairly high, there were issues surrounding trust and understanding that hindered adoption and, therefore, the effectiveness of digital contact tracing, particularly among BAME communities. "
2731,3,This study highlights that more needs to be done to improve adoption among groups who are more vulnerable to the effects of the virus in order to enhance uptake and acceptance of contact tracing apps.
2732,4,Smartphone-Based Interventions to Reduce Sedentary Behavior and Promote Physical Activity Using Integrated Dynamic Models: Systematic Review
2733,0,Traditional psychological theories are inadequate to fully leverage the potential of smartphones and improve the effectiveness of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) change interventions. 
2734,0,"Future interventions need to consider dynamic models taken from other disciplines, such as engineering (eg, control systems). "
2735,0,The extent to which such dynamic models have been incorporated in the development of interventions for PA and SB remains unclear.
2736,1,"Databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, Cochrane, and Scopus were searched from inception to May 15, 2019, using terms related to mobile health, dynamic models, SB, and PA. "
2737,1,"The included studies involved the following: PA or SB interventions involving human adults; either developed or evaluated integrated psychological theory with dynamic theories; used smartphones for the intervention delivery; the interventions were adaptive or just-in-time adaptive; included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), pilot RCTs, quasi-experimental, and pre-post study designs; and were published from 2000 onward. "
2738,1,"Outcomes included general characteristics, dynamic models, theory or construct integration, and measured SB and PA behaviors. "
2739,1,Data were synthesized narratively. 
2740,1,There was limited scope for meta-analysis because of the variability in the study results.
2741,2,"A total of 1087 publications were screened, with 11 publications describing 8 studies included in the review. "
2742,2,All studies targeted PA; 4 also included SB. 
2743,2,Social cognitive theory was the major psychological theory upon which the studies were based. 
2744,2,"Behavioral intervention technology, control systems, computational agent model, exploit-explore strategy, behavioral analytic algorithm, and dynamic decision network were the dynamic models used in the included studies. "
2745,2,"The effectiveness of quasi-experimental studies involved reduced SB (1 study; P=.08), increased light PA (1 study; P=.002), walking steps (2 studies; P=.06 and P<.001), walking time (1 study; P=.02), moderate-to-vigorous PA (2 studies; P=.08 and P=.81), and nonwalking exercise time (1 study; P=.31). "
2746,2,RCT studies showed increased walking steps (1 study; P=.003) and walking time (1 study; P=.06). 
2747,2,"To measure activity, 5 studies used built-in smartphone sensors (ie, accelerometers), 3 of which used the phone's GPS, and 3 studies used wearable activity trackers."
2748,3,"To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to report on smartphone-based studies to reduce SB and promote PA with a focus on integrated dynamic models. "
2749,3,These findings highlight the scarcity of dynamic model-based smartphone studies to reduce SB or promote PA. 
2750,3,The limited number of studies that incorporate these models shows promising findings. 
2751,3,Future research is required to assess the effectiveness of dynamic models in promoting PA and reducing SB.
2752,4,"The Impact of Digital Patient Portals on Health Outcomes, System Efficiency, and Patient Attitudes: Updated Systematic Literature Review"
2753,0,Patient portals are becoming increasingly popular worldwide even though their impact on individual health and health system efficiency is still unclear.
2754,1,"We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases for articles published from January 1, 2013, to October 31, 2019. "
2755,1,"Eligible studies were primary studies reporting on the impact of patient portal adoption in relation to health outcomes, health care efficiency, and patient attitudes and satisfaction. "
2756,1,"We excluded studies where portals were not accessible for patients and pilot studies, with the exception of articles evaluating patient attitudes."
2757,2,"Overall, 3456 records were screened, and 47 articles were included. "
2758,2,"Among them, 11 studies addressed health outcomes reporting positive results, such as better monitoring of health status, improved patient-doctor interaction, and improved quality of care. "
2759,2,Fifteen studies evaluated the impact of digital patient portals on the utilization of health services with mixed results. 
2760,2,"Patient characteristics were described in 32 studies, and it was reported that the utilization rate usually increases with age and female gender. "
2761,2,"Finally, 30 studies described attitudes and defined the main barriers (concerns about privacy and data security, and lack of time) and facilitators (access to clinical data and laboratory results) to the use of a portal."
2762,3,"Evidence regarding health outcomes is generally favorable, and patient portals have the potential to enhance the doctor-patient relationship, improve health status awareness, and increase adherence to therapy. "
2763,3,It is still unclear whether the use of patient portals improves health service utilization and efficiency.
2764,4,"Effects of the Interactive Web-Based Video Mon Coeur, Mon BASIC on Drug Adherence of Patients With Myocardial Infarction: Randomized Controlled Trial"
2765,0,Secondary prevention strategies after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation with the use of drug combinations are essential to reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular events. 
2766,0,"However, lack of drug adherence is known to be common in this population and to be related to treatment failure. "
2767,0,"To improve drug adherence, we developed the ""Mon Coeur, Mon BASIC"" video. "
2768,0,This online video has been specifically designed to inform patients about their disease and their current medications. 
2769,0,"Interactivity has been used to increase patient attention, and the video can also be viewed on smartphones and tablets."
2770,1,This randomized study was conducted with consecutive patients admitted to University Hospital of Lausanne for ACS. 
2771,1,"We randomized patients to an intervention group, which had access to the web-based video and a short interview with the pharmacist, and a control group receiving usual care. "
2772,1,"The primary outcome was the difference in drug adherence, assessed with the Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale (ARMS; 9 multiple-choice questions, scores ranging from 12 for perfect adherence to 48 for lack of adherence), between groups at 1, 3, and 6 months. "
2773,1,We assessed the difference in ARMS score between both groups with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
2774,1,"Secondary outcomes were differences in knowledge, readmissions, and emergency room visits between groups and patients' satisfaction with the video."
2775,2,Sixty patients were included at baseline. 
2776,2,"The median age of the participants was 59 years (IQR 49-69), and 85% (51/60) were male. "
2777,2,"At 1 month, 51 patients participated in the follow-up, 50 patients participated at 3 months, and 47 patients participated at 6 months. "
2778,2,"The mean ARMS scores at 1 and 6 months did not differ between the intervention and control groups (13.24 vs 13.15, 13.52 vs 13.68, respectively). "
2779,2,"At 3 months, this score was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (12.54 vs 13.75; P=.03). "
2780,2,"We observed significant increases in knowledge from baseline to 1 and 3 months, but not to 6 months, in the intervention group. "
2781,2,"Readmissions and emergency room visits have been very rare, and the proportion was not different among groups. "
2782,2,Patients in the intervention group were highly satisfied with the video.
2783,3,"Despite a lower sample size than we expected to reach, we observed that the ""Mon Coeur, Mon BASIC"" web-based interactive video improved patients' knowledge and seemed to have an impact on drug adherence. "
2784,3,"These results are encouraging, and the video will be offered to all patients admitted to our hospital with ACS."
2785,4,Overview and Strategy Analysis of Technology-Based Nonpharmacological Interventions for In-Hospital Delirium Prevention and Reduction: Systematic Scoping Review
2786,0,"Delirium prevention is crucial, especially in critically ill patients. "
2787,0,Nonpharmacological multicomponent interventions for preventing delirium are increasingly recommended and technology-based interventions have been developed to support them. 
2788,0,"Despite the increasing number and diversity in technology-based interventions, there has been no systematic effort to create an overview of these interventions for in-hospital delirium prevention and reduction."
2789,1,A systematic search was conducted in Scopus and Embase between 2015 and 2020. 
2790,1,A selection was made in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). 
2791,1,Studies were eligible if they contained any type of technology-based interventions and assessed delirium-/risk factor-related outcome measures in a hospital setting. 
2792,1,Data extraction and quality assessment were performed using a predesigned data form.
2793,2,A total of 31 studies were included and analyzed focusing on the types of technology and the strategies used in the interventions. 
2794,2,"Our review revealed 8 different technology types and 14 strategies that were categorized into the following 7 pathways: (1) restore circadian rhythm, (2) activate the body, (3) activate the mind, (4) induce relaxation, (5) provide a sense of security, (6) provide a sense of control, and (7) provide a sense of being connected. "
2795,2,"For all technology types, significant positive effects were found on either or both direct and indirect delirium outcomes. "
2796,2,"Several similarities were found across effective interventions: using a multicomponent approach or including components comforting the psychological needs of patients (eg, familiarity, distraction, soothing elements)."
2797,3,"Technology-based interventions have a high potential when multidimensional needs of patients (eg, physical, cognitive, emotional) are incorporated. "
2798,3,The 7 pathways pinpoint starting points for building more effective technology-based interventions. 
2799,3,Opportunities were discussed for transforming the intensive care unit into a healing environment as a powerful tool to prevent delirium.
2800,4,Patient and Clinician Characteristics Associated With Secure Message Content: Retrospective Cohort Study
2801,0,"Good communication has been shown to affect patient outcomes; however, the effect varies according to patient and clinician characteristics. "
2802,0,"To date, no research has explored the differences in the content of secure messages based on these characteristics."
2803,1,"We coded 18,309 messages that were part of threads initiated by 1031 patients with hypertension, diabetes, or both conditions, in communication with 711 staff members. "
2804,1,"We conducted four sets of analyses to identify associations between patient characteristics and the types of messages they sent, staff characteristics and the types of messages they sent, staff characteristics and the types of messages patients sent to them, and patient characteristics and the types of messages they received from staff. "
2805,1,Logistic regression was used to estimate the strength of the associations.
2806,2,"We found that younger patients had reduced odds of sharing clinical updates (odds ratio [OR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.91) and requesting prescription refills (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.90). "
2807,2,"Women had reduced odds of self-reporting biometrics (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98) but greater odds of responding to a clinician (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.42) and seeking medical guidance (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.40). "
2808,2,"Compared with White patients, Black patients had greater odds of requesting preventive care (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.30-5.51) but reduced odds of requesting a new or changed prescription (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98) or laboratory or other diagnostic procedures (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.95). "
2809,2,"Staff had lower odds of sharing medical guidance with younger patients (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.00) and uninsured patients (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.73) but had greater odds of sharing medical guidance with patients with public payers (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.26-3.25) compared with patients with private payers. "
2810,2,"Staff had reduced odds of confirming to women that their requests were fulfilled (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.98). "
2811,2,"Compared with physicians, nurse practitioners had greater odds of sharing medical guidance with patients (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.12-6.68) and receiving prescription refill requests (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.49-7.71). "
2812,2,"Registered nurses had greater odds of deferred information sharing (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.04-2.49) and receiving responses to messages (OR 3.93, 95% CI 2.18-7.11) than physicians."
2813,3,The differences we found in content use based on patient characteristics could lead to the exacerbation of health disparities when content is associated with health outcomes. 
2814,3,"Disparities in the content of secure messages could exacerbate disparities in patient outcomes, such as satisfaction, trust in the system, self-care, and health outcomes. "
2815,3,Staff and administrators should evaluate how secure messaging is used to ensure that disparities in care are not perpetuated via this communication modality.
2816,4,The Application of a Case-Based Social Media-Assisted Teaching Method in Cariology Education: Comparative Study
2817,0,Current cariology education based on the traditional teaching method faces a lot of challenges. 
2818,0,"Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented disruption in medical education and health care systems worldwide. "
2819,0,Innovation in the teaching mode of cariology education is required to change the situation.
2820,1,"Dental students of class 2019 were enrolled into the experimental group, while students of class 2018 served as control. "
2821,1,"A case based social media-assisted teaching method was used in the experimental group, which included preclass activity via social media, additional discussion and practice process record in class, and questions and answers on the platform after class. "
2822,1,"The traditional teaching method, which consisted of conventional preparation before class, traditional lectures and demonstrations followed by students practice in class, and questions and answers step after class, was used in the control group. "
2823,1,The teaching materials were the same in both groups. 
2824,1,"At the end of the program, students from both groups took cavity preparation skill evaluation tests. "
2825,1,Questionnaires were tested on the case-based social media-assisted teaching group students anonymously. 
2826,1,"All data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software (version 22.0, IBM Corp)."
2827,2,The mean student cavity preparation skill evaluation scores was 82.51 (SD 6.82) in the experimental group and 77.19 (SD 5.98) in the control group (P<.05). 
2828,2,The questionnaire response rate was 100%. 
2829,2,"Of those, 94.3% (100/106) of the students recommended the case-based social media-assisted teaching method in cariology education. "
2830,2,"The majority of the participants agreed that it helped them memorize the theoretical knowledge of cariology, facilitated in-depth discussion, improved their enthusiasm and initiative in learning, and enhanced the relationship between teachers and students (104/106, 98.1%). "
2831,2,"They also recognized that the classroom atmosphere was active (94/106, 88.7%)."
2832,3,"The case-based social media-assisted teaching method was beneficial in terms of learning, as demonstrated by the statistically significant improvement of the cavity preparation skill evaluation scores and satisfaction from attending students. "
2833,3,This method could be used to supplement the teaching of cariology.
2834,4,Web-Based Health Information Seeking Among African American and Hispanic Men Living With Chronic Conditions: Cross-sectional Survey Study
2835,0,Previous research has identified disparities in seeking and using web-based health information to inform health-related behaviors. 
2836,0,"Relatively few studies however have examined the correlations between web-based health information seeking and use based on race, gender, age, and the presence of chronic health conditions."
2837,1,Survey responses were collected from a purposive sample of African American and Hispanic men using Qualtrics web-based survey management software. 
2838,1,"To qualify for inclusion in the study, respondents had to identify as African American or Hispanic men, report having at least one chronic condition, and be aged 40 years and older. "
2839,1,A series of binary logistic regression models was created using backward elimination. 
2840,1,Statistical significance was determined at P<.05 for all analyses.
2841,2,"Web-based health information seeking among African American and Hispanic men is a function of education, the presence of multiple chronic conditions, frustration with health care providers, internet use, and the perceived reliability of web-based health information. "
2842,2,"The use of web-based health information to inform interactions with health care providers was more common among African American and Hispanic men, who rated their health as relatively good, perceived barriers to care, used technology regularly, and took more daily medications."
2843,3,Understanding the factors that influence African American and Hispanic men seeking web-based health information may help improve the care and treatment of chronic conditions. 
2844,3,African American and Hispanic men seek web-based health information as a substitute for routine care and to inform their discussions with health care providers.
2845,4,"Determinants of Fitness App Usage and Moderating Impacts of Education-, Motivation-, and Gamification-Related App Features on Physical Activity Intentions: Cross-sectional Survey Study"
2846,0,Smartphone fitness apps are considered promising tools for promoting physical activity and health. 
2847,0,"However, it is unclear which user-perceived factors and app features encourage users to download apps with the intention of being physically active."
2848,1,Data from 839 US residents who reported having used at least one smartphone fitness app were collected via a web-based survey. 
2849,1,"A confirmatory factor analysis was performed, and path modeling was used to test the hypotheses and explore the influence of moderators on structural relationships."
2850,2,The determinants explain 76% of the variance in the behavioral intention to use fitness apps. 
2851,2,"Habit (beta=.42; P<.001), performance expectancy (beta=.36; P<.001), facilitating conditions (beta=.15; P<.001), price value (beta=.13; P<.001), and effort expectancy (beta=.09; P=.04) were positively related to behavioral intention to use fitness apps, whereas social influence and hedonic motivation were nonsignificant predictors. "
2852,2,Behavioral intentions to use fitness apps were positively related to intentions of being physically active (beta=.12; P<.001; R-2=0.02). 
2853,2,"Education-related app features moderated the association between performance expectancy and habit and app usage intentions; motivation-related features moderated the association of performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and habit with usage intentions; and gamification-related features moderated the association between hedonic motivation and usage intentions. "
2854,2,"Age moderated the association between effort expectancy and usage intentions, and gender moderated the association between performance expectancy and habit and usage intentions. "
2855,2,User experience was a nonsignificant moderator. 
2856,2,Follow-up tests were used to describe the nature of significant interaction effects.
2857,3,This study identifies the drivers of the use of fitness apps. 
2858,3,"Smartphone app features should be designed to increase the likelihood of app usage, and hence physical activity, by supporting users in achieving their goals and facilitating habit formation. "
2859,3,"Target group-specific preferences for education-, motivation-, and gamification-related app features, as well as age and gender differences, should be considered. "
2860,3,Performance expectancy had a high predictive power for intended usage for male (vs female) users who appreciated motivation-related features. 
2861,3,"Thus, apps targeting these user groups should focus on goal achievement-related features (eg, goal setting and monitoring). "
2862,3,Future research could examine the mechanisms of these moderation effects and their long-term influence on physical activity.
2863,4,The Impact of Technology-Enabled Care Coordination in a Complex Mental Health System: A Local System Dynamics Model
2864,0,"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, major shortcomings in the way mental health care systems were organized were impairing the delivery of effective care. "
2865,0,"The mental health impacts of the pandemic, the recession, and the resulting social dislocation will depend on the extent to which care systems will become overwhelmed and on the strategic investments made across the system to effectively respond."
2866,1,"A system dynamics model for the regional population catchment of North Coast New South Wales, Australia, was developed that incorporated defined pathways from social determinants of mental health to psychological distress, mental health care, and suicidal behavior. "
2867,1,"The model reproduced historic time series data across a range of outcomes and was used to evaluate the relative impact of a set of scenarios on attempted suicide (ie, self-harm hospitalizations), suicide deaths, mental health-related emergency department (ED) presentations, and psychological distress over the period from 2021 to 2030. "
2868,1,"These scenarios include (1) business as usual, (2) increase in service capacity growth rate by 20%, (3) standard telehealth, and (4) technology-enabled care coordination. "
2869,1,Each scenario was tested using both pre- and post-COVID-19 social and economic conditions.
2870,2,"Technology-enabled care coordination was forecast to deliver a reduction in self-harm hospitalizations and suicide deaths by 6.71% (95% interval 5.63%-7.87%), mental health-related ED presentations by 10.33% (95% interval 8.58%-12.19%), and the prevalence of high psychological distress by 1.76 percentage points (95% interval 1.35-2.32 percentage points). "
2871,2,Scenario testing demonstrated that increasing service capacity growth rate by 20% or standard telehealth had substantially lower impacts. 
2872,2,"This pattern of results was replicated under post-COVID-19 conditions with technology-enabled care coordination being the only tested scenario, which was forecast to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on mental health and suicide."
2873,3,The use of technology-enabled care coordination is likely to improve mental health and suicide outcomes. 
2874,3,"The substantially lower effectiveness of targeting individual components of the mental health system (ie, increasing service capacity growth rate by 20% or standard telehealth) reiterates that strengthening the whole system has the greatest impact on patient outcomes. "
2875,3,"Investments into more of the same types of programs and services alone will not be enough to improve outcomes; instead, new models of care and the digital infrastructure to support them and their integration are needed."
2876,4,Patient Experience in Virtual Visits Hinges on Technology and the Patient-Clinician Relationship: A Large Survey Study With Open-ended Questions
2877,0,Patient satisfaction with in-person medical visits includes patient-clinician engagement. 
2878,0,"However, communication, empathy, and other relationship-centered care measures in virtual visits have not been adequately investigated."
2879,1,We conducted a large survey study with open-ended questions to comprehensively assess patients' experiences with virtual visits in a diverse patient population. 
2880,1,"Adults with a virtual visit between June 21, 2017, and July 12, 2017, were invited to complete a survey of 21 Likert-scale items and textboxes for comments following their visit. "
2881,1,"Factor analysis of the survey items revealed three factors: experience with technology, patient-clinician engagement, and overall satisfaction. "
2882,1,"Multivariable logistic regression was used to test the associations among the three factors and patient demographics, clinician type, and prior relationship with the clinician. "
2883,1,"Using qualitative framework analysis, we identified recurrent themes in survey comments, quantitatively coded comments, and computed descriptive statistics of the coded comments."
2884,2,"A total of 65.7% (426/648) of the patients completed the survey; 64.1% (273/426) of the respondents were women, and the average age was 46 (range 18-86) years. "
2885,2,"The sample was geographically diverse: 70.2% (299/426) from Ohio, 6.8% (29/426) from Florida, 4.2% (18/426) from Pennsylvania, and 18.7% (80/426) from other states. "
2886,2,"With regard to insurance coverage, 57.5% (245/426) were undetermined, 23.7% (101/426) had the hospital's employee health insurance, and 18.7% (80/426) had other private insurance. "
2887,2,Types of virtual visits and clinicians varied. 
2888,2,"Overall, 58.4% (249/426) of patients had an on-demand visit, whereas 41.5% (177/426) had a scheduled visit. "
2889,2,"A total of 41.8% (178/426) of patients had a virtual visit with a family physician, 20.9% (89/426) with an advanced practice provider, and the rest had a visit with a specialist. "
2890,2,"Most patients (393/423, 92.9%) agreed that their virtual visit clinician was interested in them as a person, and their virtual visit made it easy to get the care they needed (383/421, 90.9%). "
2891,2,A total of 81.9% (344/420) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their virtual visit was as good as an in-person visit by a clinician. 
2892,2,"Having a prior relationship with their virtual visit clinician was associated with less comfort and ease with virtual technology among patients (odds ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.98). "
2893,2,"In terms of technology, patients found the interface easy to use (392/423, 92.7%) and felt comfortable using it (401/423, 94.8%). "
2894,2,"Technical difficulties were associated with lower odds of overall satisfaction (odds ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76)."
2895,3,Patient-clinician engagement in virtual visits was comparable with in-person visits. 
2896,3,This study supports the value and acceptance of virtual visits. 
2897,3,"Evaluations of virtual visits should include assessments of technology and patient-clinician engagement, as both are likely to influence patient satisfaction."
2898,4,Constructing High-Fidelity Phenotype Knowledge Graphs for Infectious Diseases With a Fine-Grained Semantic Information Model: Development and Usability Study
2899,0,Phenotypes characterize the clinical manifestations of diseases and provide important information for diagnosis. 
2900,0,"Therefore, the construction of phenotype knowledge graphs for diseases is valuable to the development of artificial intelligence in medicine. "
2901,0,"However, phenotype knowledge graphs in current knowledge bases such as WikiData and DBpedia are coarse-grained knowledge graphs because they only consider the core concepts of phenotypes while neglecting the details (attributes) associated with these phenotypes."
2902,1,"PhenoSSU is an ""entity-attribute-value"" model by its very nature, and it aims to capture the full semantic information underlying phenotype descriptions with a series of attributes and values. "
2903,1,"A total of 193 clinical guidelines for infectious diseases from Wikipedia were selected as the study corpus, and 12 attributes from SNOMED-CT were introduced into the PhenoSSU model based on the co-occurrences of phenotype concepts and attribute values. "
2904,1,The expressive power of the PhenoSSU model was evaluated by analyzing whether PhenoSSU instances could capture the full semantics underlying the descriptions of the corresponding phenotypes. 
2905,1,"To automatically construct fine-grained phenotype knowledge graphs, a hybrid strategy that first recognized phenotype concepts with the MetaMap tool and then predicted the attribute values of phenotypes with machine learning classifiers was developed."
2906,2,Fine-grained phenotype knowledge graphs of 193 infectious diseases were manually constructed with the BRAT annotation tool. 
2907,2,"A total of 4020 PhenoSSU instances were annotated in these knowledge graphs, and 3757 of them (89.5%) were found to be able to capture the full semantics underlying the descriptions of the corresponding phenotypes listed in clinical guidelines. "
2908,2,"By comparison, other information models, such as the clinical element model and the HL7 fast health care interoperability resource model, could only capture the full semantics underlying 48.4% (2034/4020) and 21.8% (914/4020) of the descriptions of phenotypes listed in clinical guidelines, respectively. "
2909,2,The hybrid strategy achieved an F1-score of 0.732 for the subtask of phenotype concept recognition and an average weighted accuracy of 0.776 for the subtask of attribute value prediction.
2910,3,"PhenoSSU is an effective information model for the precise representation of phenotype knowledge for clinical guidelines, and machine learning can be used to improve the efficiency of constructing PhenoSSU-based knowledge graphs. "
2911,3,Our work will potentially shift the focus of medical knowledge engineering from a coarse-grained level to a more fine-grained level.
2912,4,"Secondary Use of Clinical Data in Data-Gathering, Non-Interventional Research or Learning Activities: Definition, Types, and a Framework for Risk Assessment"
2913,0,"The secondary use of clinical data in data-gathering, non-interventional research or learning activities (SeConts) has great potential for scientific progress and health care improvement. "
2914,0,"At the same time, it poses relevant risks for the privacy and informational self-determination of patients whose data are used."
2915,1,"In this study, we analyze each element of the concept of SeConts to provide a synthetic definition, investigate the practical relevance and scope of SeConts through a literature review, and operationalize the widespread definition of risk (as a harmful event of a certain magnitude that occurs with a certain probability) to conduct a tailored analysis of privacy risk factors typically implied in SeConts."
2916,2,We offer a conceptual clarification and definition of SeConts and provide a list of types of research and learning activities that can be subsumed under the definition of SeConts. 
2917,2,"We also offer a proposal for the classification of SeConts types into the categories non-interventional (observational) clinical research, quality control and improvement, or public health research. "
2918,2,"In addition, we provide a list of risk factors that determine the probability or magnitude of harm implied in SeConts. "
2919,2,The risk factors provide a framework for assessing the privacy-related risks for patients implied in SeConts. 
2920,2,We illustrate the use of risk assessment by applying it to a concrete example.
2921,3,"In the future, research ethics committees and data use and access committees will be able to rely on and apply the framework offered here when reviewing projects of secondary use of clinical data for learning and research purposes."
2922,4,"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study, Part II"
2923,0,"Since late 2019, the lives of people across the globe have been disrupted by COVID-19. "
2924,0,"Millions of people have become infected with the disease, while billions of people have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. "
2925,0,"Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes; however, few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals."
2926,1,"Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone use, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. "
2927,1,"Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. "
2928,1,The participants were 217 undergraduate students. 
2929,1,"Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models."
2930,2,"Linear mixed models demonstrated differences in phone use, sleep, sedentary time and number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. "
2931,2,"In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in COVID fatigue. "
2932,2,"When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone use, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (P<.001) were significantly associated with interest in COVID fatigue. "
2933,2,"Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020."
2934,3,"In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were more sedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. "
2935,3,"As the pandemic persisted through the spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. "
2936,3,"Although these large-scale shifts in mental health and behaviors are unsurprising, understanding them is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mental health during the ongoing pandemic."
2937,4,Age-Stratified Infection Probabilities Combined With a Quarantine-Modified Model for COVID-19 Needs Assessments: Model Development Study
2938,0,"Classic compartmental models such as the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model all have the weakness of assuming a homogenous population, where everyone has an equal chance of getting infected and dying. "
2939,0,"Since it was identified in Hubei, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and been declared a pandemic. "
2940,0,"Based on data from Hubei, infection and death distributions vary with age. "
2941,0,"To control the spread of the disease, various preventive and control measures such as community quarantine and social distancing have been widely used."
2942,1,"We use the age-stratified COVID-19 infection and death distributions from Hubei, China (more than 44,672 infections as of February 11, 2020) as an estimate or proxy for a study area's infection and mortality probabilities for each age group. "
2943,1,"We then apply these probabilities to the actual age-stratified population of Quezon City, Philippines, to predict infectious individuals and deaths at peak. "
2944,1,"Testing with different countries shows the predicted number of infectious individuals skewing with the country's median age and age stratification, as expected. "
2945,1,We added a Q parameter to the SEIR model to include the effects of quarantine (Q-SEIR).
2946,2,The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model. 
2947,2,"As expected, quarantine tends to delay the peaks for both the exposed and infectious groups, and to ""flatten"" the curve or lower the predicted values for each compartment. "
2948,2,These two estimates were used as a range to inform the local government's planning and response to the COVID-19 threat.
2949,3,Age stratification combined with a quarantine-modified model has good qualitative agreement with observations on infections and death rates. 
2950,3,That younger populations will have lower death rates due to COVID-19 is a fair expectation for a disease where most fatalities are among older adults.
2951,4,Using Unsupervised Machine Learning to Identify Age- and Sex-Independent Severity Subgroups Among Patients with COVID-19: Observational Longitudinal Study
2952,0,Early detection and intervention are the key factors for improving outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
2953,1,"We applied unsupervised machine learning to a data set of 853 patients with COVID-19 from the HM group of hospitals (HM Hospitales) in Madrid, Spain. "
2954,1,"Age and sex were not considered while building the clusters, as these variables could introduce biases in machine learning algorithms and raise ethical implications or enable discrimination in triage protocols."
2955,2,"From 850 clinical and laboratory variables, four tests-the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the number of neutrophils-were enough to segregate the entire patient pool into three separate clusters. "
2956,2,"Further, the percentage of monocytes and lymphocytes and the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) distinguished cluster 3 patients from the other two clusters. "
2957,2,"The highest proportion of deceased patients; the highest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the highest number of neutrophils; and the lowest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 1. "
2958,2,Cluster 2 included a lower proportion of deceased patients and intermediate levels of the previous laboratory tests. 
2959,2,"The lowest proportion of deceased patients; the lowest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the lowest number of neutrophils; and the highest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 3."
2960,3,"A few standard laboratory tests, deemed available in all emergency departments, have shown good discriminative power for the characterization of severity subgroups among patients with COVID-19."
2961,4,"Patient Portal Use, Perceptions of Electronic Health Record Value, and Self-Rated Primary Care Quality Among Older Adults: Cross-sectional Survey"
2962,0,Older adults are increasingly accessing information and communicating using patient-facing portals available through their providers' electronic health record (EHR). 
2963,0,Most theories of technology acceptance and use suggest that patients' overall satisfaction with care should be independent of their chosen level of portal engagement. 
2964,0,"However, achieving expected benefits of portal use depends on demonstrated support from providers to meet these expectations. "
2965,0,"This is especially true among older adults, who may require more guidance. "
2966,0,"However, little is known about whether misalignment of expectations around technology-facilitated care is associated with lower perceptions of care quality."
2967,1,We conducted a cross-sectional survey analysis of 158 older adults over the age of 65 (average age 71.4 years) across Michigan using a 13-measure composite of self-assessed health care quality. 
2968,1,"Portal use was categorized as none, moderate (use of 1-3 functionalities), or extensive (use of 4-7 functionalities). "
2969,1,EHR value perception was measured by asking respondents how they felt their doctor's EHR use improved the patient-provider relationship.
2970,2,"Moderate portal users, compared to those who were extensive users, had lower estimated care quality (-0.214 on 4-point scale; P=.03). "
2971,2,Differences between extensive portal users and nonportal users were not significant. 
2972,2,Quality perception was only particularly low among moderate portal users with low EHR value perception; those with high EHR value perception rated quality similarly to other portal user groups.
2973,3,"Older adults who are moderate portal users are the least satisfied with their care, and the most sensitive to perceptions of how well their provider uses the EHR to support the relationship. "
2974,3,Encouraging portal use without compromising perceptions of quality requires thinking beyond patient-focused education. 
2975,3,Achieving value from use of patient-facing technologies with older adults is contingent upon matched organizational investments that support technology-enabled care delivery. 
2976,3,Providers and staff need policies and practices that demonstrate technology adeptness. 
2977,3,Older adults may need more tailored signaling and accommodation for technology to be maximally impactful.
2978,4,Development of a Resource Guide to Support the Engagement of Mental Health Providers and Patients With Digital Health Tools: Multimethod Study
2979,0,"As mental illness continues to affect 1 in 5 individuals, and the need for support has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, the promise of digital mental health tools remains largely unrealized due to a lack of uptake by patients and providers. "
2980,0,"Currently, most efforts on supporting the uptake of digital mental health tools remain fragmented across organizations and geography. "
2981,0,There is a critical need to synthesize these efforts in order to provide a coordinated strategy of supporting the adoption of digital mental health tools.
2982,1,The web-based resource was developed using a multimethod approach. 
2983,1,A grey literature review was conducted in 2019 to identify relevant toolkits that are available in the public domain. 
2984,1,"This was supplemented with an environmental scan where individuals with expertise in the development, acquisition, implementation, and evaluation of digital mental health tools were invited to contribute additional tools or documents not identified in the grey literature search. "
2985,1,An engagement workshop was held with stakeholders to explore how the resource document should be developed and delivered. 
2986,1,These findings were collectively used to develop the final iteration of the resource document.
2987,2,"Based on a gray literature review and environmental scan with 27 experts, 25 resources were identified and included in the resource guide. "
2988,2,These resources were developed for patients and providers by organizations from 5 countries. 
2989,2,"An engagement workshop was held with 14 stakeholders, and barriers related to cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and accessibility of the toolkit were identified. "
2990,2,"The final iteration of the resource document was developed by the research team using findings from the gray literature review, environmental scan, and engagement workshop. "
2991,2,"The contents of the 45-page resource guide are directed at mental health care providers, administrators, and patients (inclusive of families and caregivers)."
2992,3,The use of a multimethod approach led to the development of a resource guide that builds on existing evidence on digital mental health tools and was co-designed with stakeholders and end-users. 
2993,3,The resource guide is now publicly available online for free and is being promoted through digital health and mental health websites. 
2994,3,Future work should explore how this document can be integrated into clinical care delivery and pathways.
2995,4,Health Care Cybersecurity Challenges and Solutions Under the Climate of COVID-19: Scoping Review
2996,0,"COVID-19 has challenged the resilience of the health care information system, which has affected our ability to achieve the global goal of health and well-being. "
2997,0,"The pandemic has resulted in a number of recent cyberattacks on hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the World Health Organization and its partners, and others."
2998,1,"A scoping review was conducted by searching two major scientific databases (PubMed and Scopus) using the search formula ""(covid OR healthcare) AND cybersecurity."" Reports, news articles, and industry white papers were also included if they were related directly to previously published works, or if they were the only available sources at the time of writing. "
2999,1,"Only articles in English published in the last decade were included (ie, 2011-2020) in order to focus on current issues, challenges, and solutions."
3000,2,"We identified 9 main challenges in cybersecurity, 11 key solutions that health care organizations adapted to address these challenges, and 4 key areas that need to be strengthened in terms of cybersecurity capacity in the health sector. "
3001,2,"We also found that the most prominent and significant methods of cyberattacks that occurred during the pandemic were related to phishing, ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and malware."
3002,3,"This scoping review identified the most impactful methods of cyberattacks that targeted the health sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the challenges in cybersecurity, solutions, and areas in need of improvement. "
3003,3,We provided useful insights to the health sector on cybersecurity issues during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics that may materialize in the future.
3004,4,The Uncounted Casualties of a Hidden COVID-19 Epidemic in China: Cross-sectional Study on Deaths Related to Overwork
3005,0,"During the COVID-19 response, nonclinical essential workers usually worked overtime and experienced significant work stress, which subsequently increased their risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and pre-existing conditions. "
3006,0,"Deaths on duty, including deaths due to overwork, during the COVID-19 response were usually reported on web-based platforms for public recognition and solidarity. "
3007,0,"Although no official statistics are available for these casualties, a list of on-duty deaths has been made publicly available on the web by crowdsourcing."
3008,1,"Based on a web-based crowdsourced list of deaths on duty during the first wave of the COVID-19 response in China, we manually verified all overwork-related death records against the full-text web reports from credible sources. "
3009,1,"After excluding deaths caused by COVID-19 infection and accidents, a total of 340 deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers were attributed to combatting the COVID-19 crisis. "
3010,1,"We coded the key characteristics of the deceased workers, including sex, age at death, location, causes of death, date of incidence, date of death, containment duties, working area, and occupation. "
3011,1,The temporal and spatial correlations between deaths from overwork and COVID-19 cases in China were also examined using Pearson correlation coefficient.
3012,2,"From January 20 to April 26, 2020, at least 340 nonclinical frontline workers in China were reported to have died as a result of overwork while combatting COVID-19. "
3013,2,"The weekly overwork mortality was positively correlated with weekly COVID-19 cases (r=0.79, P<.001). "
3014,2,"Two-thirds of deceased workers (230/340, 67.6%) were under 55 years old, and two major causes of deaths related to overwork were cardiovascular diseases (138/340, 40.6%) and cerebrovascular diseases (73/340, 21.5%). "
3015,2,"Outside of Hubei province, there were almost 2.5 times as many deaths caused by COVID-19-related overwork (308/340, 90.6%) than by COVID-19 itself (n=120)."
3016,3,The high number of deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers at the frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic is alarming. 
3017,3,Policies for occupational health protection against work hazards should therefore be prioritized and enforced.
3018,4,Potential Correlates of Internet Gaming Disorder Among Indonesian Medical Students: Cross-sectional Study
3019,0,Internet gaming disorder has been a controversial topic for nearly a decade. 
3020,0,"Although internet addiction has been studied in medical students, there is a paucity of evidence regarding internet gaming disorder. "
3021,0,Previous studies in Indonesia explored only the prevalence rate and characteristics.
3022,1,"A cross-sectional study was performed from August 2019 to September 2019 using total and convenience sampling at a private university and a public university, respectively. "
3023,1,"The study variables were measured using the Indonesian version of the 10-item Internet Gaming Disorder Test, the Temperament and Character Inventory, and the Symptoms Checklist 90. "
3024,1,"Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between demographic factors, temperament, psychopathology, and the presence of internet gaming disorder."
3025,2,"Among the 639 respondents, the prevalence rate of internet gaming disorder was 2.03% (n=13), with a mean age of 20.23 (SD 0.13) years and an average gaming duration of 19.0 (SD 0.96) hours/week. "
3026,2,"Up to 71.2% respondents played using their mobile phones, and respondents with internet gaming disorder reported experiencing all psychopathologies assessed, except phobic anxiety. "
3027,2,"Bivariate analysis demonstrated that internet gaming disorder was associated with gender, gaming duration, gaming community affiliation, and 9 out of 10 domains of psychopathology. "
3028,2,"In a logistic regression model, internet gaming disorder was correlated with weekly gaming hours >= 20 hours (odds ratio [OR] 4.21, 95% CI 1.08-16.38, P=.04)."
3029,3,"These findings suggest that the prevalence of internet gaming disorder among medical students in Jakarta, Indonesia is similar to that in other populations of Asian countries. "
3030,3,"The predisposing factor for internet gaming disorder was weekly gaming duration, while other demographic, temperament, and psychopathology variables acted as probable moderators. "
3031,3,"Strategies should, therefore, be developed and integrated into medical curriculum to screen and aid individuals with these predisposing factors."
3032,4,Attitudes and Engagement of Pregnant and Postnatal Women With a Web-Based Emotional Health Tool (Mummatters): Cross-sectional Study
3033,0,Mummatters is a web-based health tool that allows women to self-assess the symptoms of depression and the presence of psychosocial risk factors throughout pregnancy and the postnatal period. 
3034,0,"It aims to increase women's awareness of their own symptoms or risk factors and their knowledge of the available support options, to encourage engagement with these support options (as appropriate), and to facilitate communication about emotional health issues between women and their health care providers."
3035,1,Mummatters was launched in November 2016. 
3036,1,Women who completed the mummatters baseline assessment were invited to complete a web-based follow-up survey 1 month later.
3037,2,"A total of 2817 women downloaded and used mummatters between November 13, 2016, and May 22, 2018, and 140 women participated in the follow-up study. "
3038,2,"Approximately half of these women (51%; 72/140) were Whooley positive (possible depression), and 43% (60/140) had an elevated psychosocial risk score on the Antenatal Risk Questionnaire. "
3039,2,"Mummatters was rated favorably by pregnant and postnatal women in terms of its acceptability (94%-99%), credibility (93%-97%), appeal (78%-91%), and potential to affect a range of health behaviors specific to supporting emotional wellness during the perinatal period (78%-93%). "
3040,2,Whooley-positive women were more likely to speak with their families than with a health care provider about their emotional health. 
3041,2,Normalizing symptoms and stigma were key barriers to seeking help.
3042,3,"Although mummatters was rated positively by consumers, only 53% (19/36) to 61% (22/36) of women with possible depression reported speaking to their health care providers about their emotional health. "
3043,3,There was a trend for more prominent barriers to seeking help among postnatal women than among pregnant women. 
3044,3,Future studies that investigate whether social barriers to seeking help are greater once a woman has an infant are warranted. 
3045,3,"Such barriers potentially place these women at greater risk of remaining untreated, as the demands on them are greater."
3046,4,A Self-Assessment Web-Based App to Assess Trends of the COVID-19 Pandemic in France: Observational Study
3047,0,We developed a self-assessment and participatory web-based triage app to assess the trends of the COVID-19 pandemic in France in March 2020.
3048,1,"Between March 21 and November 18, 2020, users of the maladiecoronavirus.fr self-triage app were asked questions about COVID-19 symptoms. "
3049,1,"Data on daily hospitalizations, large-scale positive results on RT-PCR tests, emergency department visits, and ICU admission of individuals with COVID-19 were compared to data on daily reports of anosmia on the app."
3050,2,"As of November 18, 2020, recent anosmia was reported 575,214 times from among approximately 13,000,000 responses. "
3051,2,"Daily anosmia reports during peak engagement with the app on September 16, 2020, were spatially correlated with the peak in daily COVID-19-related hospitalizations in November 2020 (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [rho]=0.77; P<.001). "
3052,2,"This peak in daily anosmia reports was observed primarily among young adults (age range 18-40 years), being observed 49 days before the peak of hospitalizations that corresponded to the first wave of infections among the young population, followed by a peak in hospitalizations among older individuals (aged >= 50 years) in November 2020. "
3053,2,"The reduction in the daily reports of anosmia associated with the peaks in the number of cases preceded the reduction in daily hospitalizations by 10 and 9 days during the first and the second waves of infection, respectively, although the reduction in the positivity rates on RT-PCR tests preceded the reduction in daily hospitalizations by only 2 days during the second wave of infections."
3054,3,"Data on daily reports of anosmia collected through a nationwide, web-based self-assessment app can be a relevant tool to anticipate surges in outbreaks, hospitalizations, and ICU admission during the COVID-19 pandemic."
3055,4,Electronic Health Risk Behavior Screening With Integrated Feedback Among Adolescents in Primary Care: Randomized Controlled Trial
3056,0,Health risk behaviors are the most common sources of morbidity among adolescents. 
3057,0,"Adolescent health guidelines (Guidelines for Preventive Services by the AMA and Bright Futures by the Maternal Child Health Bureau) recommend screening and counseling, but the implementation is inconsistent."
3058,1,This was a randomized controlled trial comparing an electronic tool to usual care in five pediatric clinics in the Pacific Northwest. 
3059,1,"A total of 300 participants aged 13-18 years who attended a well-care visit between September 30, 2016, and January 12, 2018, were included. "
3060,1,"Adolescents were randomized after consent by employing a 1:1 balanced age, sex, and clinic stratified schema with 150 adolescents in the intervention group and 150 in the control group. "
3061,1,"Intervention adolescents received electronic screening with integrated feedback, and the clinicians received a summary report of the results. "
3062,1,Control adolescents received usual care. 
3063,1,"Outcomes, assessed via online survey methods, included adolescent-reported receipt of counseling during the visit (measured a day after the visit) and health risk behavior change (measured at 3 and 6 months after the visit)."
3064,2,"Of the original 300 participants, 94% (n=282), 94.3% (n=283), and 94.6% (n=284) completed follow-up surveys at 1 day, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively, with similar levels of attrition across study arms. "
3065,2,The mean risk behavior score at baseline was 2.86 (SD 2.33) for intervention adolescents and 3.10 (SD 2.52) for control adolescents (score potential range 0-21). 
3066,2,"After adjusting for age, gender, and random effect of the clinic, intervention adolescents were 36% more likely to report having received counseling for endorsed risk behaviors than control adolescents (adjusted rate ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.78) 1 day after the well-care visit. "
3067,2,"Both the intervention and control groups reported decreased risk behaviors at the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments, with no significant group differences in risk behavior scores at either time point (3-month group difference: beta=-.15, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.01, P=.05; 6-month group difference: beta=-.12, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.52, P=.57)."
3068,3,"Although electronic health screening with integrated feedback improves the delivery of counseling by clinicians, the impact on risk behaviors is modest and, in this study, not significantly different from usual care. "
3069,3,More research is needed to identify effective strategies to reduce risk in the context of well-care.
3070,4,Examining Tweet Content and Engagement of Canadian Public Health Agencies and Decision Makers During COVID-19: Mixed Methods Analysis
3071,0,Effective communication during a health crisis can ease public concerns and promote the adoption of important risk-mitigating behaviors. 
3072,0,"Public health agencies and leaders have served as the primary communicators of information related to COVID-19, and a key part of their public outreach has taken place on social media platforms."
3073,1,"We retrieved data from tweets by Canadian public health agencies and decision makers from January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020. "
3074,1,"The Twitter accounts were categorized as belonging to either a public health agency, regional or local health department, provincial health authority, medical health officer, or minister of health. "
3075,1,We analyzed trends in COVID-19 tweet engagement and conducted a content analysis on a stratified random sample of 485 tweets to examine the message functions and risk communication strategies used by each account type.
3076,2,"We analyzed 32,737 tweets authored by 118 Canadian public health Twitter accounts, of which 6982 tweets were related to COVID-19. "
3077,2,"Medical health officers authored the largest percentage of COVID-19-related tweets (n=1337, 35%) relative to their total number of tweets and averaged the highest number of retweets per COVID-19 tweet (112 retweets per tweet). "
3078,2,Public health agencies had the highest frequency of daily tweets about COVID-19 throughout the study period. 
3079,2,"Compared to tweets containing media and user mentions, hashtags and URLs were used in tweets more frequently by all account types, appearing in 69% (n=4798 tweets) and 68% (n=4781 tweets) of COVID-19-related tweets, respectively. "
3080,2,Tweets containing hashtags also received the highest average retweets (47 retweets per tweet). 
3081,2,"Our content analysis revealed that of the three tweet message functions analyzed (information, action, community), tweets providing information were the most commonly used across most account types, constituting 39% (n=181) of all tweets; however, tweets promoting actions from users received higher than average retweets (55 retweets per tweet). "
3082,2,"When examining tweets that received one or more retweet (n=359), the difference between mean retweets across the message functions was statistically significant (P<.001). "
3083,2,"The risk communication strategies that we examined were not widely used by any account type, appearing in only 262 out of 485 tweets. "
3084,2,"However, when these strategies were used, these tweets received more retweets compared to tweets that did not use any risk communication strategies (P<.001) (61 retweets versus 13 retweets on average)."
3085,3,Public health agencies and decision makers should examine what messaging best meets the needs of their Twitter audiences to maximize sharing of their communications. 
3086,3,Public health accounts that do not currently employ risk communication strategies in their tweets may be missing an important opportunity to engage with users about the mitigation of health risks related to COVID-19.
3087,4,Investigating Associations Between Screen Time and Symptomatology in Individuals With Serious Mental Illness: Longitudinal Observational Study
3088,0,"Increasing screen time exposure from digital devices like smartphones has shown a variety of mixed associations with cognition, behavior, and well-being in adults and children but little is known about its associations with symptomatology in individuals with serious mental illness."
3089,1,"In this observational study, we recruited smartphone-owning adults (>= 18 years old) with schizophrenia and healthy controls. "
3090,1,"We installed 2 research-source smartphone apps, mindLAMP and Beiwe, to collect survey results, cognitive test results, and screen time metrics over a period of 3 months. "
3091,1,"Surveys were scheduled for twice a week, but participants were instructed to take the surveys naturally as much or as little as they wanted. "
3092,1,Screen time was collected continuously in the background. 
3093,1,A total of 140 participants was recruited from the outpatient clinic population as well as through general public advertising. 
3094,1,"Age-matched, smartphone-owning healthy controls were also part of the recruitment pool. "
3095,1,A specification curve analysis was a priori designed to explore the relationship between every combination of independent variable and dependent variable in order to demonstrate to what degree screen time relates to symptoms in individuals with serious mental illness.
3096,2,"The sample consisted of 88 participants (54 with schizophrenia and 34 healthy controls) who completed both the initial and follow-up visits, completed at least one self-reported survey, and had a minimum passive data cutoff of 5 consecutive days. "
3097,2,"While we found an association between smartphone screen time metrics and cognition (adjusted R-2=0.107, P<.001), specification curve analysis revealed a wide range of heterogenous associations with screen time from very negative to very positive. "
3098,2,"The effects differed based on diagnostic group, age bracket, type of regression model used, and the specific independent and dependent variables selected for analysis."
3099,3,The associations between screen time and mental health in patients with schizophrenia are heterogenous when examined with methods that reduce analytical bias. 
3100,3,The heterogeneity in associations suggests that complex and personalized potential effects must be understood in the greater context of an individual. 
3101,3,This analysis of longitudinally collected screen time data shows potential for future research that could benefit from high resolution metrics on smartphone use.
3102,4,The Effect of Information and Communication Technology and Social Networking Site Use on Older Peoples Well-Being in Relation to Loneliness: Review of Experimental Studies
3103,0,"In the last decades, the relationship between social networking sites (SNSs) and older people's loneliness is gaining specific relevance. "
3104,0,"Studies in this field are often based on qualitative methods to study in-depth self-perceived issues, including loneliness and well-being, or quantitative surveys to report the links between information and communication technologies (ICTs) and older people's well-being or loneliness. "
3105,0,"However, these nonexperimental methods are unable to deeply analyze the causal relationship. "
3106,0,"Moreover, the research on older people's SNS use is still scant, especially regarding its impact on health and well-being. "
3107,0,"In recent years, the existing review studies have separately focused their attention on loneliness and social isolation of older people or on the use of ICTs and SNSs in elderly populations without addressing the relationship between the former and the latter. "
3108,0,This thorough qualitative review provides an analysis of research performed using an experimental or quasi-experimental design that investigates the causal effect of ICT and SNS use on elderly people's well-being related to loneliness.
3109,1,"Using an approach that integrates the methodological framework for scoping studies and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for systematic reviews, we identified 11 articles that met our inclusion criteria. "
3110,1,"A thematic and content analysis was performed based on the ex post categorization of the data on the selected studies, and the data were summarized in tables."
3111,2,"The analysis of the selected articles showed that: (1) ICT use is positively but weakly related to the different measures of older people's well-being and loneliness, (2) overall, the studies under review lack a sound experimental design, (3) the main limitations of these studies lie in the lack of rigor in the sampling method and in the recruitment strategy."
3112,3,The analysis of the reviewed studies confirms the existence of a beneficial effect of ICT use on the well-being of older people in terms of reduced loneliness. 
3113,3,"However, the causal relationship is often found to be weak. "
3114,3,This review highlights the need to study these issues further with adequate methodological rigor.
3115,4,A Virtual Ward Model of Care for Patients With COVID-19: Retrospective Single-Center Clinical Study
3116,0,COVID-19 has necessitated the implementation of innovative health care models in preparation for an influx of patients. 
3117,0,A virtual ward model delivers clinical care remotely to patients in isolation. 
3118,0,We report on an Australian cohort of patients with COVID-19 treated in a virtual ward.
3119,1,"Retrospective clinical assessment was performed for 223 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated in a virtual ward in Brisbane, Australia, from March 25 to May 15, 2020. "
3120,1,Statistical analysis was performed for variables associated with the length of stay and hospitalization.
3121,2,"Of 223 patients, 205 (92%) recovered without the need for escalation to hospital care. "
3122,2,The median length of stay in the virtual ward was 8 days (range 1-44 days). 
3123,2,"In total, 18 (8%) patients were referred to hospital, of which 6 (33.3%) were discharged after assessment at the emergency department. "
3124,2,"Furthermore, 12 (5.4%) patients were admitted to hospital, of which 4 (33.3%) required supplemental oxygen and 2 (16.7%) required mechanical ventilation. "
3125,2,No deaths were recorded. 
3126,2,"Factors associated with escalation to hospital care were the following: hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% CI 1.28-9.87; P=.01), sputum production (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.74-15.49; P=.001), and arthralgia (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.21-11.71; P=.02) at illness onset and a polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold <= 20 of on a diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.25-19.63; P=.02)."
3127,3,"Our results suggest that a virtual ward model of care to treat patients with COVID-19 is safe and efficacious, and only a small number of patients would potentially require escalation to hospital care. "
3128,3,Further studies are required to validate this model of care.
3129,4,"The Role of Transparency, Trust, and Social Influence on Uncertainty Reduction in Times of Pandemics: Empirical Study on the Adoption of COVID-19 Tracing Apps"
3130,0,Contact tracing apps are an essential component of an effective COVID-19 testing strategy to counteract the spread of the pandemic and thereby avoid overburdening the health care system. 
3131,0,"As the adoption rates in several regions are undesirable, governments must increase the acceptance of COVID-19 tracing apps in these times of uncertainty."
3132,1,Representative survey data were gathered at two measurement points (before and after the app's release) and analyzed by performing covariance-based structural equation modeling (n=1003).
3133,2,"We found that uncertainty reduction measures in the form of the transparency dimensions disclosure and accuracy, as well as social influence and trust in government, foster the adoption process. "
3134,2,The use of the COVID-19 tracing app in turn reduced the perceived privacy and performance risks but did not reduce social risks and health-related COVID-19 concerns.
3135,3,This study contributes to the mass adoption of health care technology and URT research by integrating interactive communication measures and transparency as a multidimensional concept to reduce different types of uncertainty over time. 
3136,3,"Furthermore, our results help to derive communication strategies to promote the mass adoption of COVID-19 tracing apps, thus detecting infection chains and allowing intelligent COVID-19 testing."
3137,4,"Use of eHealth by Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis: Observational, Cross-sectional, Multicenter Study"
3138,0,"The use of eHealth tools (eg, the internet, mobile apps, and connected devices) in the management of chronic diseases and for rheumatoid arthritis is growing. "
3139,0,eHealth may improve the overall quality of care provided to patients with chronic diseases.
3140,1,"In this cross-sectional, multicenter study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria, were recruited from 5 university hospitals (Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand, Limoges, Montpellier, and Toulouse). "
3141,1,"Patients completed an anonymous self-questionnaire, including demographic data, evaluating their eHealth use (ie, access, support, frequency of use, type of use, and reason for use). "
3142,1,"The rheumatologist in charge of each patient completed an independent medical questionnaire on disease characteristics, activity of rheumatoid arthritis, and treatments. "
3143,1,Data were collected between December 2018 and July 2019.
3144,2,"Questionnaires were completed by 575 participants, with a mean age of 62 (SD 13) years, 447 (77.7%) of whom were female. "
3145,2,"Overall, 82.2% (473/575) of the participants had access to eHealth through a computer (402/467, 86.1%), tablet (188/467, 40.2%), or smartphone (221/467, 47.3%). "
3146,2,"Of these, 36.4% (170/467) of the participants used the internet for health in general, and 28.7% (134/467) used it specifically for rheumatoid arthritis-related reasons. "
3147,2,"All these 134 patients used eHealth to learn about disease pathology, and 66.4% (89/134) of them used it as a tool to help monitor rheumatoid arthritis. "
3148,2,"Most patients (87/125, 69.6%) had a paper file, 19.2% (24/125) used a digital tool (spreadsheets, 10/125, 8%; mobile app, 9/125, 7.2%; or website, 5/125, 4%), and 24.8% (31/125) did not use any tools for monitoring. "
3149,2,"Few patients (16/125, 12.8%) used tools for treatment reminders. "
3150,2,About 21.6% (27/125) of the patients using eHealth used a specific app for rheumatoid arthritis. 
3151,2,"Univariate analysis showed that age, education level, employment status, treatment, comothidities, membership of a patient association, and patient education program were associated with eHealth use for rheumatoid arthritis. "
3152,2,"Multivariate analysis showed that membership of a patient association (odds ratio [OR] 5.8, 95% CI 3.0-11.2), use of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0), and comorbidities (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.8) remained associated with eHealth use for rheumatoid arthritis. "
3153,2,"Recommendation by a doctor (225/330, 68.2%), ease of use (105/330, 31.8%), and data security (69/330, 20.9%) were factors favoring the use of eHealth."
3154,3,"To date, few patients have used eHealth for disease management. "
3155,3,The use of a reliable and validated eHealth tool for rheumatoid arthritis could therefore be promoted by rheumatologists and could optimize therapeutic adherence.
3156,4,Evaluation of the Liver Disease Information in Baidu Encyclopedia and Wikipedia: Longitudinal Study
3157,0,The internet has changed the way of people acquiring health information. 
3158,0,"Previous studies have shown that Wikipedia is a reasonably reliable medical resource, and it has been ranked higher than other general websites in various search engines. "
3159,0,Baidu Encyclopedia is one of the most popular encyclopedia websites in China. 
3160,0,"However, no studies have shown the quality of the content provided in the Baidu Encyclopedia."
3161,1,We searched for information on liver diseases by using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision Version 2016 codes on Wikipedia (in English) and Baidu Encyclopedia (in Chinese). 
3162,1,"The quality of the articles was assessed using the DISCERN instrument, which consists of 3 sections. "
3163,1,We recorded the latest editing date of the webpages and calculated the date interval to evaluate the update timeliness of these websites.
3164,2,"We found 22 entries on liver diseases in Baidu Encyclopedia and 15 articles in Wikipedia between September 15, 2016, and September 30, 2016, and we found 25 entries in Baidu Encyclopedia and 16 articles in Wikipedia between September 15, 2019, and September 30, 2019. "
3165,2,"In section 1 of the DISCERN instrument, the mean (SE) scores of Baidu Encyclopedia entries were significantly lower than those of Wikipedia articles. "
3166,2,"In section 2 and section 3 of the DISCERN instrument, the DISCERN scores of Baidu Encyclopedia entries were lower than those of Wikipedia articles, but the differences were not statistically significant. "
3167,2,The total DISCERN scores of Baidu Encyclopedia entries were significantly lower than those of Wikipedia articles. 
3168,2,The update interval of the entries in Baidu Encyclopedia was found to be significantly longer than that of the articles in Wikipedia.
3169,3,This study shows that the quality of articles and the reliability of the research content on liver diseases in Wikipedia are better than those of the entries in Baidu Encyclopedia. 
3170,3,"However, the quality of the treatment choices provided in both Wikipedia and Baidu Encyclopedia is not satisfactory. "
3171,3,"Wikipedia is updated more frequently than Baidu Encyclopedia, thereby ensuring that the information presented has the most recent research findings. "
3172,3,"The findings of our study suggest that in order to find accurate health information, it is important to seek the help of medical professionals instead of looking for a prescription amid the confusing information provided on the internet."
3173,4,Effect of Interactive eHealth Interventions on Improving Medication Adherence in Adults With Long-Term Medication: Systematic Review
3174,0,"Medication nonadherence leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes, making it a major priority in health care. "
3175,0,eHealth provides an opportunity to offer medication adherence interventions with minimal effort from health care providers whose time and resources are limited.
3176,1,"MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were systematically searched from January 2014 to July 2019 as well as reference lists and citations of included articles. "
3177,1,Eligible studies fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) randomized controlled trial with a usual care control group; (2) a total sample size of at least 50 adult patients using long-term medication; (3) applying an interactive eHealth intervention aimed at the patient or patient's caregiver; and (4) medication adherence as primary outcome. 
3178,1,Methodologic quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 
3179,1,Selection and quality assessment of studies were performed by 2 researchers (BP and BvdB or JV) independently. 
3180,1,A best evidence synthesis was performed according to the Cochrane Back Review Group.
3181,2,"Of the 9047 records screened, 22 randomized clinical trials were included reporting on 29 interventions. "
3182,2,"Most (21/29, 72%) interventions specified using a (mobile) phone for calling, SMS text messaging, or mobile apps. "
3183,2,A majority of all interactive interventions (17/29) had a statistically significant effect on medication adherence (P<.05). 
3184,2,"Of these interventions, 9 had at least a small effect size (Cohen d >= 0.2) and 3 showed strong odds for becoming adherent in the intervention group (odds ratio > 2.0). "
3185,2,"Our best evidence synthesis provided strong evidence for a positive effect of interventions using SMS text messages or interactive voice response, mobile app, and calls as mode of providing adherence tele-feedback. "
3186,2,"Intervention strategies ""to teach medication management skills,"" ""to improve health care quality by coordinating medication adherence care between professionals,"" and ""to facilitate communication or decision making between patients and health care providers"" also showed strong evidence for a positive effect."
3187,3,"Overall, this review supports the hypothesis that interactive eHealth interventions can be effective in improving medication adherence. "
3188,3,Intervention strategies that improve patients' treatment involvement and their medication management skills are most promising and should be considered for implementation in practice.
3189,4,Telemedicine in the United States: An Introduction for Students and Residents
3190,0,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound mental health impacts among the general population worldwide. 
3191,0,"As many in-person mental health support services have been suspended or transitioned online to facilitate physical distancing, there have been numerous calls for the rapid expansion of asynchronous virtual mental health (AVMH) resources. "
3192,0,"These AVMH resources have great potential to provide support for people coping with negative mental health impacts associated with the pandemic; however, literature examining use prior to COVID-19 illustrates that the uptake of these resources is consistently low."
3193,1,"Data from this study were drawn from the first wave of a large multiwave cross-sectional monitoring survey, distributed from May 14 to 29, 2020. "
3194,1,Participants (N=3000) were adults living in Canada. 
3195,1,"Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample, and bivariate cross-tabulations were used to examine the relationships between the use of AVMH resources and self-reported indicators of mental health that included a range of emotional and coping-related responses to the pandemic. "
3196,1,Univariate and fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine associations between sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and use of AVMH resources in the subgroup of participants who reported experiencing one or more adverse mental health impacts identified in the set of self-reported mental health indicators.
3197,2,"Among the total sample, 2.0% (n=59) of participants reported accessing AVMH resources in the prior 2 weeks to cope with stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest rates of use among individuals who reported self-harm (n=5, 10.4%) and those who reported coping ""not well"" with COVID-19-related stress (n=22, 5.5%). "
3198,2,"Within the subgroup of 1954 participants (65.1% of the total sample) who reported an adverse mental health impact related to COVID-19, 54 (2.8%) reported use of AVMH resources. "
3199,2,"Individuals were more likely to have used AVMH resources if they had reported receiving in-person mental health supports, were connecting virtually with a mental health worker or counselor, or belonged to a visible minority group."
3200,3,"Despite substantial government investment into AVMH resources, uptake is low among both the general population and individuals who may benefit from the use of these resources as a means of coping with the adverse mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. "
3201,3,Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the barriers to use.
3202,4,Peoples Experiences and Satisfaction With Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Australia: Cross-Sectional Survey Study
3203,0,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has rapidly been adopted to deliver health care services around the world. "
3204,0,"To date, studies have not compared people's experiences with telehealth services during the pandemic in Australia to their experiences with traditional in-person visits."
3205,1,"A national, cross-sectional, community survey was conducted between June 5 and June 12, 2020 in Australia. "
3206,1,"In total, 1369 participants who were aged >= 18 years and lived in Australia were recruited via targeted advertisements on social media (ie, Facebook and Instagram). "
3207,1,"Participants responded to survey questions about their telehealth experience, which included a free-text response option. "
3208,1,A generalized linear model was used to estimate the adjusted relative risks of having a poorer telehealth experience than a traditional in-person visit experience. 
3209,1,Content analysis was performed to determine the reasons why telehealth experiences were worse than traditional in-person visit experiences.
3210,2,"Of the 596 telehealth users, the majority of respondents (n=369, 61.9%) stated that their telehealth experience was ""just as good as"" or ""better than"" their traditional in-person medical appointment experience. "
3211,2,"On average, respondents perceived that telehealth would be moderately useful to very useful for medical appointments after the COVID-19 pandemic ends (mean 3.67, SD 1.1). "
3212,2,"Being male (P=.007), having a history of both depression and anxiety (P=.016), and lower patient activation scores (ie, individuals' willingness to take on the role of managing their health/health care) (P=.036) were significantly associated with a poor telehealth experience. "
3213,2,"In total, 6 overarching themes were identified from free-text responses for why participants' telehealth experiences were poorer than their traditional in-person medical appointment experiences, as follows: communication is not as effective, limitations with technology, issues with obtaining prescriptions and pathology results, reduced confidence in their doctor, additional burden for complex care, and inability to be physically examined."
3214,3,"Based on our sample's responses, telehealth appointment experiences were comparable to traditional in-person medical appointment experiences. "
3215,3,"Telehealth may be worthwhile as a mode of health care delivery while the pandemic continues, and it may continue to be worthwhile after the pandemic."
3216,4,Capturing the Impact of Patient Portals Based on the Quadruple Aim and Benefits Evaluation Frameworks: Scoping Review
3217,0,"Despite extensive and continuing research in the area of patient portals, measuring the impact of patient portals remains a convoluted process."
3218,1,A scoping review was conducted using the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley. 
3219,1,Reporting was guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews. 
3220,1,"A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted using the Ovid platform, and the following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE (R) ALL (including epub ahead of print, in-process, and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, and PsycINFO. "
3221,1,CINAHL on the EBSCO platform and Web of Science were searched for studies published between March 2015 and June 2020. 
3222,1,A systematic gray literature search was conducted using the Google search engine. 
3223,1,Extracted data were tabulated based on a coding template developed to categorize the literature into themes and areas of interest.
3224,2,A total of 96 studies were included for data extraction. 
3225,2,"The studies were categorized based on the QA dimensions, with strict adherence to the definitions for each dimension. "
3226,2,"From the patients' perspective, it was determined that most evaluations focused on benefits and barriers to access, access to test results, medication adherence, condition management, medical notes, and secure messaging. "
3227,2,"From the population perspective, the evaluations focused on the increase in population outreach, decrease in disparities related to access to care services, and improvement in quality of care. "
3228,2,"From the health care workforce perspective, the evaluations focused on the impact of patients accessing medical records, impact on workflow, impact of bidirectional secure messaging, and virtual care. "
3229,2,"From the health system perspective, the evaluations focused on decreases in no-show appointments, impact on office visits and telephone calls, impact on admission and readmission rates and emergency department visits, and impact on health care use. "
3230,2,"Overall, 77 peer-reviewed studies were mapped on the expanded version of the BE framework. "
3231,2,The mapping was performed using subdimensions to create a more precise representation of the areas that are currently explored when studying patient portals. 
3232,2,Most of the studies evaluated more than one subdimension.
3233,3,The QA and BE frameworks provide guidance in identifying gaps in the current literature by providing a way to show how an impact was assessed. 
3234,3,This study highlights the need to appropriately plan how the impact will be assessed and how the findings will be translated into effective adaptations.
3235,4,Dynamic Public Health Surveillance to Track and Mitigate the US COVID-19 Epidemic: Longitudinal Trend Analysis Study
3236,0,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has led to a global pandemic. "
3237,0,"The United States has been severely affected, accounting for the most COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide. "
3238,0,"Without a coordinated national public health plan informed by surveillance with actionable metrics, the United States has been ineffective at preventing and mitigating the escalating COVID-19 pandemic. "
3239,0,Existing surveillance has incomplete ascertainment and is limited by the use of standard surveillance metrics. 
3240,0,"Although many COVID-19 data sources track infection rates, informing prevention requires capturing the relevant dynamics of the pandemic."
3241,1,"Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted COVID-19 data from global public health registries. "
3242,1,"We used an empirical difference equation to measure daily case numbers for our use case in 50 US states and the District of Colombia as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R."
3243,2,"Examination of the United States and state data demonstrated that most US states are experiencing outbreaks as measured by these new metrics of speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence. "
3244,2,"Larger US states have high COVID-19 caseloads as a function of population size, density, and deficits in adherence to public health guidelines early in the epidemic, and other states have alarming rates of speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence in novel infections. "
3245,2,"North and South Dakota have had the highest rates of COVID-19 transmission combined with positive acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence. "
3246,2,Wisconsin and Illinois also have alarming indicators and already lead the nation in daily new COVID-19 infections. 
3247,2,"As the United States enters its third wave of COVID-19, all 50 states and the District of Colombia have positive rates of speed between 7.58 (Hawaii) and 175.01 (North Dakota), and persistence, ranging from 4.44 (Vermont) to 195.35 (North Dakota) new infections per 100,000 people."
3248,3,Standard surveillance techniques such as daily and cumulative infections and deaths are helpful but only provide a static view of what has already occurred in the pandemic and are less helpful in prevention. 
3249,3,"Public health policy that is informed by dynamic surveillance can shift the country from reacting to COVID-19 transmissions to being proactive and taking corrective action when indicators of speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence remain positive week over week. "
3250,3,Implicit within our dynamic surveillance is an early warning system that indicates when there is problematic growth in COVID-19 transmissions as well as signals when growth will become explosive without action. 
3251,3,A public health approach that focuses on prevention can prevent major outbreaks in addition to endorsing effective public health policies. 
3252,3,"Moreover, subnational analyses on the dynamics of the pandemic allow us to zero in on where transmissions are increasing, meaning corrective action can be applied with precision in problematic areas. "
3253,3,Dynamic public health surveillance can inform specific geographies where quarantines are necessary while preserving the economy in other US areas.
3254,4,Stakeholder Feedback of Electronic Medication Adherence Products: Qualitative Analysis
3255,0,"Medication management among older adults continues to be a challenge, and innovative electronic medication adherence products have been developed to address this need."
3256,1,"Older adults, caregivers, and health care providers tested the usability of 22 electronic medication adherence products. "
3257,1,"After testing 5 products, participants were invited to participate in a one-on-one interview to investigate their perceptions and experiences with the features, usefulness, and preference for electronic medication adherence products tested. "
3258,1,"The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using exploratory inductive coding to generate themes. "
3259,1,The first 13 interviews were independently coded by 2 researchers. 
3260,1,"The percentage agreement and Cohen kappa after analyzing those interviews were 79% and 0.79, respectively. "
3261,1,A single researcher analyzed the remaining interviews.
3262,2,"Of the 37 participants, 21 (57%) were older adults, 5 (14%) were caregivers, and 11 (30%) were health care providers. "
3263,2,"The themes and subthemes generated from the qualitative analysis included product factors (subthemes: simplicity and product features, including availability and usability of alarms, portability, restricted access to medications, and storage capacity) and user factors (subthemes: sentiment, affordability, physical and cognitive capability, and technology literacy and learnability)."
3264,3,Electronic medication adherence products have the potential to enable independent medication management in older adults. 
3265,3,"The choice of a particular product should be made after considering individual preferences for product features, affordability, and the sentiment of the users. "
3266,3,"Older adults, caregivers, and health care providers prefer electronic medication adherence products that are simple to set up and use, are portable, have easy-to-access medication compartments, are secure, and have adequate storage capacity."
3267,4,Public Emotions and Rumors Spread During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China: Web-Based Correlation Study
3268,0,Various online rumors have led to inappropriate behaviors among the public in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in China These rumors adversely affect people's physical and mental health. 
3269,0,"Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between public emotions and rumors during the epidemic may help generate useful strategies for guiding public emotions and dispelling rumors."
3270,1,"We used the web-crawling tool Scrapy to gather data published by People's Daily on Sina Weibo, a popular social media platform in China, after January 8, 2020. "
3271,1,Netizens' comments under each Weibo post were collected. 
3272,1,"Nearly 1 million comments thus collected were divided into 5 categories: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and neutral, based on the underlying emotional information identified and extracted from the comments by using a manual identification process. "
3273,1,Data on rumors spread online were collected through Tencent's Jiaozhen platform. 
3274,1,Time-lagged cross-correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationship between public emotions and rumors.
3275,2,"Our results indicated that the angrier the public felt, the more rumors there would likely be (r=0.48, P<.001) Similar results were observed for the relationship between fear and rumors (r=0.51, P<.001) and between sadness and rumors (r=0.47, P <.001). "
3276,2,"Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between happiness and rumors, with happiness lagging the emergence of rumors by 1 day (r=0.56, P<.001). "
3277,2,"In addition, our data showed a significant positive correlation between fear and fearful rumors (r=0.34, P=.02)."
3278,3,"Our findings confirm that public emotions are related to the rumors spread online in the context of COVID-19 in China Moreover, these findings provide several suggestions, such as the use of web-based monitoring methods, for relevant authorities and policy makers to guide public emotions and behavior during this public health emergency."
3279,4,Psychosocial Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Large-scale Quasi-Experimental Study on Social Media
3280,0,The COVID-19 pandemic has caused several disruptions in personal and collective lives worldwide. 
3281,0,"The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multifaceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. "
3282,0,"Despite noting this as a ""mental health tsunami"", the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remain unexplored at scale. "
3283,0,"Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances."
3284,1,"We obtained about 60 million Twitter streaming posts originating from the United States from March 24 to May 24, 2020, and compared these with about 40 million posts from a comparable period in 2019 to attribute the effect of COVID-19 on people's social media self-disclosure. "
3285,1,"Using these data sets, we studied people's self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions of support. "
3286,1,"We employed transfer learning classifiers that identified the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). "
3287,1,"We then examined the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 data sets."
3288,2,"We found that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis-mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by about 14%, and support expressions have increased by about 5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. "
3289,2,"We also observed a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. "
3290,2,Our language analyses highlighted that people express concerns that are specific to and contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis.
3291,3,"We studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that people's mental health symptomatic and support expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. "
3292,3,"However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their ""new normal."" Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, health care and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness. "
3293,3,This study shows the potential to provide insights to mental health care and stakeholders and policy makers in planning and implementing measures to mitigate mental health risks amid the health crisis.
3294,4,Importance of Multiple Reinforcing Comments and Areas for Change in Optimizing Dietary and Exercise Self-Monitoring Feedback in Behavioral Weight Loss Programs: Factorial Design
3295,0,Individualized dietary and physical activity self-monitoring feedback is a core element of behavioral weight loss interventions and is associated with clinically significant weight loss. 
3296,0,"To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated individuals' perspectives on the composition of feedback messages or the effect of feedback composition on the motivation to self-monitor."
3297,1,"Emailed feedback followed a factorial design with 2 factors (ie, reinforcing comments and areas for change), each with 3 levels (ie, 1, 4, or 8 comments). "
3298,1,A total of 250 adults with overweight or obesity who were interested in weight loss were recruited from the Qualtrics research panel. 
3299,1,Participants read 9 emails presented in a random order. 
3300,1,"For each email, respondents answered 8 questions about the likelihood to self-monitor in the future, motivation for behavioral change, and perceptions of the counselor and the email A mixed effects ordinal logistic model was used to compute conditional odds ratios and predictive margins (ie, average predicted probability) on a 5-point Likert response scale to investigate the optimal combination level of the 2 factors."
3301,2,"Emails with more reinforcing comments or areas for change were better received, with small incremental benefits for 8 reinforcing comments or areas for change versus 4 reinforcing comments or areas for change. "
3302,2,"Interactions indicated that the best combination for 3 of 8 outcomes assessed (ie, motivation to make behavioral changes, counselor's concern for their welfare, and the perception that the counselor likes them) was the email with 8 reinforcing comments and 4 areas for change. "
3303,2,Emails with 4 reinforcing comments and 4 areas for change resulted in the highest average probability of individuals who reported being very likely to self-monitor in the future.
3304,3,The study findings suggest how feedback might be optimized for efficacy. 
3305,3,Future studies should explore whether the composition of feedback email affects actual self-monitoring performance.
3306,4,Concerns About Information Regarding COVID-19 on the Internet: Cross-Sectional Study
3307,0,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention have released COVID-19-related information to the public through various channels to raise their concern level of the pandemic, increase their knowledge of disease prevention, and ensure the uptake of proper preventive practices."
3308,1,"The questionnaire, which consisted of 15 closed-ended questions, was designed to investigate Chinese netizens' knowledge about COVID-19. "
3309,1,"The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants through Dingxiangyisheng WeChat (a public, medical, and health service platform in China) accounts. "
3310,1,Standard descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data.
3311,2,"In total, 10,304 respondents were surveyed on the internet (response rate=1.75%; 10,304/590,000). "
3312,2,"Nearly all (n=9803, 95.30%) participants were concerned about ""confirmed cases"" of COVID-19, and 87.70% (n=9036) received information about the outbreak through social media websites. "
3313,2,"There were significant differences in participants' concerns by sex (P=.02), age (P<.001), educational attainment (P=.001), and occupation (P<.001). "
3314,2,All knowledge questions and preventive practices were associated with concerns about COVID-19. 
3315,2,"The results of the multivariate logistic regression indicated that participants' sex, educational attainment, occupation and employment status, knowledge acquisition, and concern level were significantly associated with the practice of proper preventive behaviors."
3316,3,"This study elucidated Chinese netizens' concerns, information sources, and preventive behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. "
3317,3,"Sex, educational attainment, occupation and employment status, knowledge acquisition, and level of concern were key factors associated with proper preventive behaviors. "
3318,3,This offers a theoretical basis for the government to provide targeted disease prevention and control information to the public.
3319,4,A Patient Self-Checkup App for COVID-19: Development and Usage Pattern Analysis
3320,0,Clear guidelines for a patient with suspected COVID-19 infection are unavailable. 
3321,0,"Many countries rely on assessments through a national hotline or telecommunications, but this only adds to the burden of an already overwhelmed health care system. "
3322,0,"In this study, we developed an algorithm and a web application to help patients get screened."
3323,1,"The algorithm was developed via consultations with 6 physicians who directly screened, diagnosed, and/or treated patients with COVID-19. "
3324,1,The algorithm mainly focused on when to test a patient in order to allocate limited resources more efficiently. 
3325,1,The application was designed to be mobile-friendly and deployed on the web. 
3326,1,"We collected the application usage pattern data from March 1 to March 27, 2020. "
3327,1,"We evaluated the association between the usage pattern and the numbers of COVID-19 confirmed, screened, and mortality cases by access location and digital literacy by age group."
3328,2,"The algorithm used epidemiological factors, presence of fever, and other symptoms. "
3329,2,"In total, 83,460 users accessed the application 105,508 times. "
3330,2,"Despite the lack of advertisement, almost half of the users accessed the application from outside of Korea. "
3331,2,"Even though the digital literacy of the 60+ years age group is half of that of individuals in their 50s, the number of users in both groups was similar for our application."
3332,3,We developed an expert-opinion-based algorithm and web-based application for screening patients. 
3333,3,This innovation can be helpful in circumstances where information on a novel disease is insufficient and may facilitate efficient medical resource allocation.
3334,4,COVID-19 and the Gendered Use of Emojis on Twitter: Infodemiology Study
3335,0,"The online discussion around the COVID-19 pandemic is multifaceted, and it is important to examine the different ways by which online users express themselves. "
3336,0,"Since emojis are used as effective vehicles to convey ideas and sentiments, they can offer important insight into the public's gendered discourses about the pandemic."
3337,1,We collected over 50 million tweets referencing the hashtags #Covid-19 and #Covid19 for a period of more than 2 months in early 2020. 
3338,1,"Using a mixed method, we extracted three data sets containing tweets that reference men, women, and sexual and gender minorities, and we then analyzed emoji use along each gender category. "
3339,1,"We identified five major themes in our analysis including morbidity fears, health concerns, employment and financial issues, praise for frontline workers, and unique gendered emoji use. "
3340,1,"The top 600 emojis were manually classified based on their sentiment, indicating how positive, negative, or neutral each emoji is and studying their use frequencies."
3341,2,"The findings indicate that the majority of emojis are overwhelmingly positive in nature along the different genders, but sexual and gender minorities, and to a lesser extent women, are discussed more negatively than men. "
3342,2,"There were also many differences alongside discourses of men, women, and gender minorities when certain topics were discussed, such as death, financial and employment matters, gratitude, and health care, and several unique gendered emojis were used to express specific issues like community support."
3343,3,"Emoji research can shed light on the gendered impacts of COVID-19, offering researchers an important source of information on health crises as they happen in real time."
3344,4,Associations Between Patient Health Outcomes and Secure Message Content Exchanged Between Patients and Clinicians: Retrospective Cohort Study
3345,0,The number of electronic messages securely exchanged between clinic staff and patients has risen dramatically over the last decade. 
3346,0,A variety of studies explored whether the volume of messages sent by patients was associated with outcomes. 
3347,0,"None of these studies, however, examined whether message content itself was associated with outcomes. "
3348,0,"Because secure messaging is a significant form of communication between patients and clinic staff, it is critical to evaluate the context of the communication to best understand its impact on patient health outcomes."
3349,1,"We applied a taxonomy developed specifically for secure messages to 14,394 patient- and clinic staff-generated messages derived from patient-initiated message threads. "
3350,1,"Our study population included 1602 patients, 50.94% (n=816) of whom initiated message threads. "
3351,1,We conducted linear regression analyses to determine whether message codes were associated with changes in glycemic (A1C) levels in patients with diabetes and changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure in patients with hypertension.
3352,2,Patients who initiated threads had larger declines in A1Cs (P=.01) compared to patients who did not initiate threads. 
3353,2,"Clinic nonresponse was associated with decreased SBP (beta=-.30; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.04), as were staffs' action responses (beta=-30; 95% CI -0.58 to -0.02). "
3354,2,"Increased DBP, SBP, and A1C levels were associated with patient-generated appreciation and praise messages and staff encouragement with effect sizes ranging from 0.51 (A1C) to 5.80 (SBP). "
3355,2,We found improvements in SBP associated with patients' complaints (beta=-4.03; 95% CI -7.94 to -0.12). 
3356,2,Deferred information sharing by clinic staff was associated with increased SBP (beta=1.29; 95% CI 0.4 to 2.19).
3357,3,This is the first research to find associations between message content and patients' health outcomes. 
3358,3,Our findings indicate mixed associations between patient message content and patient outcomes. 
3359,3,"Further research is needed to understand the implications of this work; in the meantime, health care providers should be aware that their message content may influence patient health outcomes."
3360,4,Clinical Characteristics and Prognostic Factors for Intensive Care Unit Admission of Patients With COVID-19: Retrospective Study Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
3361,0,Many factors involved in the onset and clinical course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are still unknown. 
3362,0,"Although big data analytics and artificial intelligence are widely used in the realms of health and medicine, researchers are only beginning to use these tools to explore the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of patients with COVID-19."
3363,1,"We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling) to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. "
3364,1,"We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the Servicio de Salud de Castilla-La Mancha (SESCAM) Health Care Network (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1 to March 29, 2020. "
3365,1,"We extracted related clinical information regarding diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases."
3366,2,"A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified; 5519 (52.5%) were male, with a mean age of 58.2 years (SD 19.7). "
3367,2,"Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea; however, all three symptoms occurred in fewer than half of the cases. "
3368,2,"Overall, 6.1% (83/1353) of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. "
3369,2,"Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm, we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission; patients younger than 56 years, without tachypnea, and temperature <39 degrees Celsius (or >39 degrees C without respiratory crackles) were not admitted to the ICU. "
3370,2,"In contrast, patients with COVID-19 aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnea and delayed their visit to the emergency department after being seen in primary care."
3371,3,"Our results show that a combination of easily obtainable clinical variables (age, fever, and tachypnea with or without respiratory crackles) predicts whether patients with COVID-19 will require ICU admission."
3372,4,Wearable Technology Acceptance in Health Care Based on National Culture Differences: Cross-Country Analysis Between Chinese and Swiss Consumers
3373,0,The advancement of wearable devices and growing demand of consumers to monitor their own health have influenced the medical industry. 
3374,0,"Health care providers, insurers, and global technology companies intend to develop more wearable devices incorporating medical technology and to target consumers worldwide. "
3375,0,"However, acceptance of these devices varies considerably among consumers of different cultural backgrounds. "
3376,0,Consumer willingness to use health care wearables is influenced by multiple factors that are of varying importance in various cultures. 
3377,0,"However, there is insufficient knowledge of the extent to which social and cultural factors affect wearable technology acceptance in health care."
3378,1,"A new model for acceptance of health care wearables was conceptualized by incorporating predictors of different theories such as technology acceptance, health behavior, and privacy calculus based on an existing framework. "
3379,1,"To verify the model, a web-based survey in both the Chinese and German languages was conducted in China and Switzerland, resulting in 201 valid Chinese and 110 valid Swiss respondents. "
3380,1,A multigroup partial least squares path analysis was applied to the survey data.
3381,2,"Performance expectancy (beta=.361, P<.001), social influence (beta=.475, P<.001), and hedonic motivation (beta=.111, P=.01) all positively affected the behavioral intention of consumers to adopt wearables, whereas effort expectancy, functional congruence, health consciousness, and perceived privacy risk did not demonstrate a significant impact on behavioral intention. "
3382,2,"The group-specific path coefficients indicated health consciousness (beta=.150, P=.01) as a factor positively affecting only the behavior intention of the Chinese respondents, whereas the factors affecting only the behavioral intention of the Swiss respondents proved to be effort expectancy (beta=.165, P=.02) and hedonic motivation (beta=.212, P=.02). "
3383,2,"Performance expectancy asserted more of an influence on the behavioral intention of the Swiss (v=.426, P<.001) than the Chinese (beta=.271, P<.001) respondents, whereas social influence had a greater influence on the behavioral intention of the Chinese (beta=.321, P<.001) than the Swiss (beta=.217, P=.004) respondents. "
3384,2,"Overall, the Chinese consumers displayed considerably higher behavioral intention (P<.001) than the Swiss. "
3385,2,These discrepancies are explained by differences in national culture.
3386,3,This is one of the first studies to investigate consumers' intention to adopt wearables from a cross-cultural perspective. 
3387,3,"This provides a theoretical and methodological foundation for future research, as well as practical implications for global vendors and insurers developing and promoting health care wearables with appropriate features in different countries. "
3388,3,"The testimonials and support by physicians, evidence of measurement accuracy, and easy handling of health care wearables would be useful in promoting the acceptance of wearables in Switzerland. "
3389,3,"The opinions of in-group members, involvement of employers, and multifunctional apps providing credible health care advice and solutions in cooperation with health care institutions would increase acceptance among the Chinese."
3390,4,Development of an Item Bank to Measure Medication Adherence: Systematic Review
3391,0,Medication adherence is important in managing the progression of chronic diseases. 
3392,0,A promising approach to reduce cognitive burden when measuring medication adherence lies in the use of computer-adaptive tests (CATs) or in the development of shorter patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). 
3393,0,"However, the lack of an item bank currently hampers this progress."
3394,1,"Using the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA), articles published before October 2019 were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. "
3395,1,"Items from existing PROMs were classified and selected (""binned"" and ""winnowed"") according to standards published by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cooperative Group."
3396,2,A total of 126 unique PROMs were identified from 213 studies in 48 countries. 
3397,2,Items from the literature review (47 PROMs with 579 items for which permission has been obtained) underwent binning and winnowing. 
3398,2,This resulted in 421 candidate items (77 extent of adherence and 344 reasons for adherence).
3399,3,We developed an item bank for measuring general medication adherence using items from validated PROMs. 
3400,3,This will allow researchers to create new PROMs from selected items and provide the foundation to develop CATs.
3401,4,Teleconsultation Between Patients and Health Care Professionals in the Catalan Primary Care Service: Message Annotation Analysis in a Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study
3402,0,"Over the last decade, telemedicine services have been introduced in the public health care systems of several industrialized countries. "
3403,0,"In Catalonia, the use of eConsulta, an asynchronous teleconsultation service between primary care professionals and citizens in the public health care system, has already reached 1 million cases. "
3404,0,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of eConsulta was growing at a monthly rate of 7%, and the growth has been exponential from March 15, 2020 to the present day. "
3405,0,"Despite its widespread usage, there is little qualitative evidence describing how this tool is used."
3406,1,"Twenty general practitioners retrospectively annotated a random sample of 5382 cases managed by eConsulta according to three aspects: the type of interaction according to 6 author-proposed categories, whether the practitioners believed a face-to-face visit was avoided, and whether they believed the patient would have requested a face-to-face visit had eConsulta not been available. "
3407,1,A total of 1217 cases were classified three times by three different professionals to assess the degree of consensus among them.
3408,2,"The general practitioners considered that 79.60% (4284/5382) of the teleconsultations resulted in avoiding a face-to-face visit, and considered that 64.96% (3496/5382) of the time, the patient would have made a face-to-face visit in the absence of a service like eConsulta. "
3409,2,"The most frequent uses were for management of test results (26.77%, 1433/5354), management of repeat prescriptions (24.30%, 1301/5354), and medical enquiries (14.23%, 762/5354). "
3410,2,"The degree of agreement among professionals as to the annotations was mixed, with the highest consensus demonstrated for the question ""Has the online consultation avoided a face-to-face visit?"" (3/3 professionals agreed 67.95% of the time, 827/1217), and the lowest consensus for the type of use of the teleconsultation (3/3 professionals agreed 57.60% of the time, 701/1217)."
3411,3,This study shows the ability of eConsulta to reduce the number of face-to-face visits for 55% (79% x 65%) to 79% of cases. 
3412,3,"In comparison to previous research, these results are slightly more pessimistic, although the rates are still high and in line with administrative data proxies, showing that 84% of patients using teleconsultations do not make an in-person appointment in the following 3 months. "
3413,3,"With respect to the type of consultation performed, our results are similar to the existing literature, thus providing robust support for eConsulta's usage. "
3414,3,The mixed degree of consensus among professionals implies that results derived from artificial intelligence tools such as message classification algorithms should be interpreted in light of these shortcomings.
3415,4,Exploring Types of Information Sources Used When Choosing Doctors: Observational Study in an Online Health Care Community
3416,0,Patients attempt to make appropriate decisions based on their own knowledge when choosing a doctor. 
3417,0,"In this process, the first question usually faced is that of how to obtain useful and relevant information. "
3418,0,This study investigated the types of information sources that are used widely by patients in choosing a doctor and identified ways in which the preferred sources differ in various situations.
3419,1,"This study overcomes a major limitation in the use of the survey technique by employing data from the Good Doctor website, which is now China's leading online health care community, data which are objective and can be obtained relatively easily and frequently. "
3420,1,Multinomial logistic regression models were applied to examine whether the proportion of use of these information sources changes in different situations. 
3421,1,We then used visual analysis to explore the question of which type of information source patients prefer to use when they seek medical assistance from doctors with different specialties.
3422,2,"The 3 main information sources were online reviews (OR), family and friend recommendations (FR), and doctor recommendations (DR), with proportions of use of 32.93% (559,345/1,698,666), 23.68% (402,322/1,698,666), and 17.48% (296,912/1,698,666), respectively. "
3423,2,"Difficulty in medical decision making, the hospital level, and rural-urban differences were significantly associated with patients' preferred information sources for choosing doctors. "
3424,2,"Further, the sources of information that patients prefer to use were found to vary when they looked for doctors with different medical specialties."
3425,3,"Patients are less likely to use online reviews when medical decisions are more difficult or when the provider is not a tertiary hospital, the former situation leading to a greater use of online reviews and the latter to a greater use of family and friend recommendations. "
3426,3,"In addition, patients in large cities are more likely to use information from online reviews than family and friend recommendations. "
3427,3,"Among different medical specialties, for those in which personal privacy is a concern, online reviews are the most common source. "
3428,3,"For those related to children, patients are more likely to refer to family and friend recommendations, and for those related to surgery, they value doctor recommendations more highly. "
3429,3,Our results can not only contribute to aiding government efforts to further promote the dissemination of health care information but may also help health care industry managers develop better marketing strategies.
3430,4,"Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain: Large-Scale, Online, Self-Reported Population Survey"
3431,0,Spain has been one of the countries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
3432,0,"Since the first confirmed case was reported on January 31, 2020, there have been over 405,000 cases and 28,000 deaths in Spain. "
3433,0,The economic and social impact is without precedent. 
3434,0,"Thus, it is important to quickly assess the situation and perception of the population. "
3435,0,Large-scale online surveys have been shown to be an effective tool for this purpose.
3436,1,"We obtained a large sample using an online survey with 24 questions related to COVID-19 in the week of March 28-April 2, 2020, during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain. "
3437,1,"The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit 156,614 participants via social media posts that targeted the general adult population (age >18 years). "
3438,1,"Given such a large sample, the 95% CI was 0.843 for all reported proportions."
3439,2,"Regarding social behavior during confinement, participants mainly left their homes to satisfy basic needs. "
3440,2,We found several statistically significant differences in social behavior across genders and age groups. 
3441,2,The population's willingness to comply with the confinement measures is evident. 
3442,2,"From the survey answers, we identified a significant adverse economic impact of the pandemic on those working in small businesses and a negative correlation between economic damage and willingness to stay in confinement. "
3443,2,"The survey revealed that close contacts play an important role in the transmission of the disease, and 28% of the participants lacked the necessary resources to properly isolate themselves. "
3444,2,"We also identified a significant lack of testing, with only 1% of the population tested and 6% of respondents unable to be tested despite their doctor's recommendation. "
3445,2,We developed a generalized linear model to identify the variables that were correlated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. 
3446,2,"Using this model, we estimated an average of 5% for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Spanish population during the time of the study. "
3447,2,A seroprevalence study carried out later by the Spanish Ministry of Health reported a similar level of disease prevalence (5%).
3448,3,"Large-scale online population surveys, distributed via social media and online messaging platforms, can be an effective, cheap, and fast tool to assess the impact and prevalence of an infectious disease in the context of a pandemic, particularly when there is a scarcity of official data and limited testing capacity."
3449,4,Validation of the Raw National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) Questionnaire to Assess Perceived Workload in Patient Monitoring Tasks: Pooled Analysis Study Using Mixed Models
3450,0,Patient monitoring is indispensable in any operating room to follow the patient's current health state based on measured physiological parameters. 
3451,0,"Reducing workload helps to free cognitive resources and thus influences human performance, which ultimately improves the quality of care. "
3452,0,"Among the many methods available to assess perceived workload, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) provides the most widely accepted tool. "
3453,0,"However, only few studies have investigated the validity of the NASA-TLX in the health care sector."
3454,1,"In this pooled analysis, we evaluated raw NASA-TLX scores collected after performing patient monitoring tasks in four different investigator-initiated, computer-based, prospective, multicenter studies. "
3455,1,All of them were conducted in three hospitals with a high standard of care in central Europe. 
3456,1,"In these already published studies, we compared conventional patient monitoring with two newly developed situation awareness-oriented monitoring technologies called Visual Patient and Visual Clot. "
3457,1,"The participants were resident and staff anesthesia and intensive care physicians, and nurse anesthetists with completed specialization qualification. "
3458,1,We analyzed the raw NASA-TLX scores by fitting mixed linear regression models and univariate models with different covariates.
3459,2,We assessed a total of 1160 raw NASA-TLX questionnaires after performing specific patient monitoring tasks. 
3460,2,Good test performance and higher self-rated diagnostic confidence correlated significantly with lower raw NASA-TLX scores and the subscores (all P<.001). 
3461,2,"Staff physicians rated significantly lower workload scores than residents (P=.001), whereas nurse anesthetists did not show any difference in the same comparison (P=.83). "
3462,2,Standardized distraction resulted in higher rated total raw NASA-TLX scores (P<.001) and subscores. 
3463,2,There was no gender difference regarding perceived workload (P=.26). 
3464,2,"The new visualization technologies Visual Patient and Visual Clot resulted in significantly lower total raw NASA-TLX scores and all subscores, including high self-rated performance, when compared with conventional monitoring (all P<.001)."
3465,3,This study validated a modified raw NASA-TLX questionnaire for patient monitoring tasks. 
3466,3,The scores obtained correctly represented the assumed influences of the examined covariates on the perceived workload. 
3467,3,We reported high criterion validity. 
3468,3,The NASA-TLX questionnaire appears to be a reliable tool for measuring subjective workload. 
3469,3,Further research should focus on its applicability in a clinical setting.
3470,4,Effects of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Routine Care for Adults in Treatment for Depression and Anxiety: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
3471,0,"Although there is evidence for the efficacy of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), the generalizability of results to routine care is limited."
3472,1,"The acceptability (uptake, participants' characteristics, adherence, and satisfaction), effectiveness, and negative effects (deterioration) of nonrandomized pre-post designs conducted under routine care conditions were synthesized using systematic review and meta-analytic approaches."
3473,2,A total of 19 studies including 30 groups were included in the analysis. 
3474,2,"Despite high heterogeneity, individual effect sizes of investigated studies indicate clinically relevant changes, with effect sizes ranging from Hedges' g=0.42-1.88, with a pooled effect of 1.78 for depression and 0.94 for anxiety studies. "
3475,2,"Uptake, participants' characteristics, adherence, and satisfaction indicate a moderate to high acceptability of the interventions. "
3476,2,The average deterioration across studies was 2.9%.
3477,3,This study provides evidence supporting the acceptability and effectiveness of guided iCBT for the treatment of depression and anxiety in routine care. 
3478,3,"Given the high heterogeneity between interventions and contexts, health care providers should select interventions that have been proven in randomized controlled clinical trials. "
3479,3,The successful application of iCBT may be an effective way of increasing health care in multiple contexts.
3480,4,Examining Responsiveness to an Incentive-Based Mobile Health App: Longitudinal Observational Study
3481,0,"The Carrot Rewards app was developed as part of a public-private partnership to reward Canadians with loyalty points for downloading the app, referring friends, completing educational health quizzes, and health-related behaviors with long-term objectives of increasing health knowledge and encouraging healthy behaviors. "
3482,0,"During the first 3 months after program rollout in British Columbia, a number of program design elements were adjusted, creating observed differences between groups of users with respect to the potential impact of program features on user engagement levels."
3483,1,"Participants in this longitudinal, nonexperimental observational study included British Columbia citizens who downloaded the app between March and July 2016. "
3484,1,A regression methodology was used to examine the impact of changes to several program design features on quiz offer acceptance and engagement with this mHealth app.
3485,2,"Our results, based on the longitudinal app use of 54,917 users (mean age 35, SD 13.2 years; 65.03% [35,647/54,917] female), indicated that the key drivers of the likelihood of continued user engagement, in order of greatest to least impact, were (1) type of rewards earned by users (eg, movies [+355%; P<.001], air travel [+210%; P< .001], and grocery [+140%; P<.001] relative to gas), (2) time delay between early offers (-64%; P<.001), (3) the content of the health intervention (eg, healthy eating [-10%; P<.001] vs exercise [+20%, P<.001] relative to health risk assessments), and (4) changes in the number of points offered. "
3486,2,Our results demonstrate that reducing the number of points associated with a particular quiz by 10% only led to a 1% decrease in the likelihood of offer response (P<.001) and that each of the other design features had larger impacts on participant retention than did changes in the number of points.
3487,3,"The results of this study demonstrate that this program, built around the principles of behavioral economics in the form of the ongoing awarding of a small number of reward points instantly following the completion of health interventions, was able to drive significantly higher engagement levels than those demonstrated in previous literature exploring the intersection of mHealth apps and financial incentives. "
3488,3,"Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of incentive matters to user engagement; however, our results indicate that the number of points offered for these reward point-based health interventions is less important than other program design features such as the type of reward points being offered, the timing of intervention and reward offers, and the content of the health interventions in driving continued engagement by users."
3489,4,Computer-Controlled Virtual Humans in Patient-Facing Systems: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
3490,0,Virtual humans (VH) are computer-generated characters that appear humanlike and simulate face-to-face conversations using verbal and nonverbal cues. 
3491,0,"Unlike formless conversational agents, like smart speakers or chatbots, VH bring together the capabilities of both a conversational agent and an interactive avatar (computer-represented digital characters). "
3492,0,"Although their use in patient-facing systems has garnered substantial interest, it is unknown to what extent VH are effective in health applications."
3493,1,Electronic bibliographic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles with relevant key terms. 
3494,1,Studies were included in the systematic review if they designed or evaluated VH in patient-facing systems. 
3495,1,"Of the included studies, studies that used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate VH were included in the meta-analysis; they were then summarized using the PICOTS framework (population, intervention, comparison group, outcomes, time frame, setting) Summary effect sizes, using random-effects models, were calculated, and the risk of bias was assessed."
3496,2,"Among the 8,125 unique records identified, 53 articles describing 33 unique systems, were qualitatively, systematically reviewed. "
3497,2,Two distinct design categories emerged - simple VH and VH augmented with health sensors and trackers. 
3498,2,"Of the 53 articles, 16 (26 studies) with 44 primary and 22 secondary outcomes were included in the meta-analysis. "
3499,2,"Meta-analysis of the 44 primary outcome measures revealed a significant difference between intervention and control conditions, favoring the VH intervention (SMD = .166, 95% CI .039-.292, P=.012), but with evidence of some heterogeneity, I-2=49.3% There were more cross-sectional (k= 15) than longitudinal studies (k= 11). "
3500,2,"The intervention was delivered using a personal computer in most studies (k=18), followed by a tablet (k=4), mobile kiosk (k=2), head-mounted display (k=1), and a desktop computer in a community center (k=1)."
3501,3,We offer evidence for the efficacy of VH in patient-facing systems. 
3502,3,"Considering that studies included different population and outcome types, more focused analysis is needed in the future. "
3503,3,Future studies also need to identify what features of virtual human interventions contribute toward their effectiveness.
3504,4,Building a Successful Massive Open Online Course About Multiple Sclerosis: A Process Description
3505,0,"Over the course of a year, we developed and tested a 6-week massive open online course (MOOC) on multiple sclerosis (MS) in consultation with the MS community. "
3506,0,The course targeted the MS community and interested laypeople and was titled Understanding MS. 
3507,0,"The primary purpose of the course was to improve MS knowledge, health literacy, and resilience among participants. "
3508,0,The final version of the MOOC made available for open enrollment was ranked first among all MOOCs released in 2019 (n>2400) based on participant reviews.
3509,1,"The development process included a course development focus group; the creation of more than 50 content videos and related text, quizzes, activities, and discussion prompts; the creation of original images and animations; a pilot study; and collaborations with people living with MS, MS nurses, allied health care practitioners, and neurologists and researchers from 4 universities."
3510,2,"Overall, the process was efficient and effective. "
3511,2,"With a few small changes, we recommend this approach to those seeking to develop a similar course. "
3512,2,This process led to the development of a highly reviewed MOOC with excellent user satisfaction.
3513,3,"We identified 5 key lessons from this process: (1) community support is essential, (2) stakeholder involvement improves content quality, (3) plan for research from the beginning, (4) coordination between the academic lead and project manager team ensures a consistent voice, and (5) a network of collaborators is a key resource."
3514,4,The Internet Hospital as a Telehealth Model in China: Systematic Search and Content Analysis
3515,0,The internet hospital is an innovative organizational form and service mode under the tide of internet plus in the Chinese medical industry. 
3516,0,It is the product of the interaction between consumer health needs and supply-side reform. 
3517,0,"However, there has still been no systematic summary of its establishment and definition, nor has there been an analysis of its service content."
3518,1,"Data on internet hospitals were obtained via the Baidu search engine for results up until January 1, 2019. "
3519,1,"Based on the results of the search, we obtained more detailed information from the official websites and apps of 130 online hospitals and formed a database for descriptive analysis."
3520,2,"By January 2019, the number of registered internet hospitals had expanded to approximately 130 in 25 provinces, accounting for 73.5% of all provinces or province-level municipalities in China Internet hospitals, as a new telehealth model, are distinct but overlap with online health, telemedicine, and mobile medical. "
3521,2,"They offer four kinds of services-convenience services, online medical services, telemedicine, and related industries. "
3522,2,"In general, there is an underlying common treatment flowchart of care in ordinary and internet hospitals. "
3523,2,"There are three different sponsors-government-led integration, hospital-led, and enterprise-led internet hospitals-for which stakeholders have different supporting content and responsibilities."
3524,3,"Internet hospitals are booming in China, and it is the joint effort of the government and the market to alleviate the coexistence of shortages of medical resources and wasted medical supplies. "
3525,3,"The origin of internet hospitals in the eastern and western regions, the purpose of the establishment initiator, and the content of online and offline services are different. "
3526,3,Only further standardized management and reasonable industry freedom can realize the original intention of the internet hospital of meeting various health needs.
3527,4,Information Loss in Harmonizing Granular Race and Ethnicity Data: Descriptive Study of Standards
3528,0,Data standards for race and ethnicity have significant implications for health equity research.
3529,1,"We examined the data standards guiding harmonization of race and ethnicity data for multiracial and multiethnic populations, using the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Statistical Policy Directive No. "
3530,1,15
3531,2,"Of 1211 participants in the ECHORN cohort study, 901 (74.40%) selected 1 racial category. "
3532,2,"Of those that selected 1 category, 13.0% (117/901) selected Caribbean; 6.4% (58/901), Puerto Rican or Boricua; and 13.5% (122/901), the mixed or multiracial category. "
3533,2,"A total of 17.84% (216/1211) of participants selected 2 or more categories, with 15.19% (184/1211) selecting 2 categories and 2.64% (32/1211) selecting 3 or more categories. "
3534,2,"With aggregation of ECHORN data into OMB categories, 27.91% (338/1211) of the participants can be placed in the ""more than one race"" category."
3535,3,"This analysis exposes the fundamental informatics challenges that current race and ethnicity data standards present to meaningful collection, organization, and dissemination of granular data about subgroup populations in diverse and marginalized communities. "
3536,3,Current standards should reflect the science of measuring race and ethnicity and the need for multidisciplinary teams to improve evolving standards throughout the data life cycle.
3537,4,The Use of Social Media to Increase the Impact of Health Research: Systematic Review
3538,0,"Academics in all disciplines increasingly use social media to share their publications on the internet, reaching out to different audiences. "
3539,0,"In the last few years, specific indicators of social media impact have been developed (eg, Altmetrics), to complement traditional bibliometric indicators (eg, citation count and h-index). "
3540,0,"In health research, it is unclear whether social media impact also translates into research impact."
3541,1,We conducted a systematic review to identify studies that evaluated the use of social media to disseminate research published in health-related journals. 
3542,1,We specifically looked at studies that described experimental or correlational studies linking the use of social media with outcomes related to bibliometrics. 
3543,1,"We searched the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases using a predefined search strategy (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews: CRD42017057709). "
3544,1,We conducted independent and duplicate study selection and data extraction. 
3545,1,"Given the heterogeneity of the included studies, we summarized the findings through a narrative synthesis."
3546,2,"Of a total of 18,624 retrieved citations, we included 51 studies: 7 (14%) impact studies (answering the primary aim) and 44 (86%) correlational studies (answering the secondary aim). "
3547,2,"Impact studies reported mixed results with several limitations, including the use of interventions of inappropriately low intensity and short duration. "
3548,2,"The majority of correlational studies suggested a positive association between traditional bibliometrics and social media metrics (eg, number of mentions) in health research."
3549,3,We have identified suggestive yet inconclusive evidence on the impact of using social media to increase the number of citations in health research. 
3550,3,Further studies with better design are needed to assess the causal link between social media impact and bibliometrics.
3551,4,Electronic Data Capture Versus Conventional Data Collection Methods in Clinical Pain Studies: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
3552,0,"The most commonly used means to assess pain is by patient self-reported questionnaires These questionnaires have traditionally been completed using paper-and-pencil, telephone, or in-person methods, which may limit the validity of the collected data. "
3553,0,"Electronic data capture methods represent a potential way to validly, reliably, and feasibly collect pain-related data from patients in both clinical and research settings."
3554,1,"We searched the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from database inception until November 2019. "
3555,1,"We included all peer-reviewed studies that compared electronic (any modality) and conventional (paper-, telephone-, or in-person-based) data capture methods for patient-reported pain data on one of the following outcomes: pain score equivalence, data completeness, ease of use, efficiency, and acceptability. "
3556,1,We used random effects models to combine score equivalence data across studies that reported correlations or measures of agreement between electronic and conventional pain assessment methods.
3557,2,"A total of 53 unique studies were included in this systematic review, of which 21 were included in the meta-analysis. "
3558,2,"Overall, the pain scores reported electronically were congruent with those reported using conventional modalities, with the majority of studies (36/44, 82%) that reported on pain scores demonstrating this relationship. "
3559,2,The weighted summary correlation coefficient of pain score equivalence from our meta-analysis was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.95). 
3560,2,"Studies on data completeness, patientor provider-reported ease of use, and efficiency generally indicated that electronic data capture methods were equivalent or superior to conventional methods. "
3561,2,"Most (19/23, 83%) studies that directly surveyed patients reported that the electronic format was the preferred data collection method."
3562,3,"Electronic pain-related data capture methods are comparable with conventional methods in terms of score equivalence, data completeness, ease, efficiency, and acceptability and, if the appropriate psychometric evaluations are in place, are a feasible means to collect pain data in clinical and research settings."
3563,4,Evaluating the Need to Address Digital Literacy Among Hospitalized Patients: Cross-Sectional Observational Study
3564,0,Technology is a potentially powerful tool to assist patients with transitions of care during and after hospitalization. 
3565,0,Patients with low health literacy who are predisposed to poor health outcomes are particularly poised to benefit from such interventions. 
3566,0,"However, this population may lack the ability to effectively engage with technology. "
3567,0,"Although prior research studied the role of health literacy in technology access/use among outpatients, hospitalized patient populations have not been investigated in this context. "
3568,0,"Further, with the rapid uptake of technology, access may no longer be pertinent, and differences in technological capabilities may drive the current digital divide. "
3569,0,"Thus, characterizing the digital literacy of hospitalized patients across health literacy levels is paramount."
3570,1,Adult inpatients completed a technology survey that asked about technology access/use and online capabilities as part of an ongoing quality of care study. 
3571,1,Participants' health literacy level was assessed utilizing the 3-question Brief Health Literacy Screen. 
3572,1,"Descriptive statistics, bivariate chi-squared analyses, and multivariate logistic regression analyses (adjusting for age, race, gender, and education level) were performed. "
3573,1,"Using Bonferroni correction for the 18 tests, the threshold P value for significance was <.003."
3574,2,"Among 502 enrolled participants, the mean age was 51 years, 71.3% (358/502) were African American, half (265/502, 52.8%) were female, and half (253/502, 50.4%) had at least some college education. "
3575,2,"Over one-third (191/502, 38.0%) of participants had low health literacy. "
3576,2,"The majority of participants owned devices (owned a smartphone: 116/173, 67.1% low health literacy versus 235/300, 78.3% adequate health literacy, P=.007) and had used the Internet previously (143/189, 75.7% low health literacy versus 281/309, 90.9% adequate health literacy, P<.001). "
3577,2,"Participants with low health literacy were more likely to report needing help performing online tasks (133/189, 70.4% low health literacy versus 135/303, 44.6% adequate health literacy, P<.001). "
3578,2,"In the multivariate analysis, when adjusting for age, race, gender, and education level, we found that low health literacy was not significantly associated with a lower likelihood of owning smartphones (OR: 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.4; P=.52) or using the internet ever (OR: 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-0.9; P=.02). "
3579,2,"However, low health literacy remained significantly associated with a higher likelihood of needing help performing any online task (OR: 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.6; P=.002)."
3580,3,"The majority of participants with low health literacy had access to technological devices and had used the internet previously, but they were unable to perform online tasks without assistance. "
3581,3,The barriers patients face in using online health information and other health information technology may be more related to online capabilities rather than to technology access. 
3582,3,"When designing and implementing technological tools for hospitalized patients, it is important to ensure that patients across digital literacy levels can both understand and use them."
3583,4,Online Information Exchange and Anxiety Spread in the Early Stage of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak in South Korea: Structural Topic Model and Network Analysis
3584,0,"In case of a population-wide infectious disease outbreak, such as the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), people's online activities could significantly affect public concerns and health behaviors due to difficulty in accessing credible information from reliable sources, which in turn causes people to seek necessary information on the web. "
3585,0,"Therefore, measuring and analyzing online health communication and public sentiment is essential for establishing effective and efficient disease control policies, especially in the early stage of an outbreak."
3586,1,"We collected 13,148 questions and 29,040 answers related to COVID-19 from Naver, the most popular Korean web portal (January 20, 2020, to March 2, 2020). "
3587,1,"Three main methods were used in this study: (1) the structural topic model was used to examine the topics in the online questions; (2) word network analysis was conducted to analyze the focus of people's anxiety and worry in the questions; and (3) two medical doctors assessed the appropriateness of the answers to the questions, which were primarily related to people's anxiety."
3588,2,A total of 50 topics and 6 cohesive topic communities were identified from the questions. 
3589,2,"Among them, topic community 4 (suspecting COVID-19 infection after developing a particular symptom) accounted for the largest portion of the questions. "
3590,2,"As the number of confirmed patients increased, the proportion of topics belonging to topic community 4 also increased. "
3591,2,"Additionally, the prolonged situation led to a slight increase in the proportion of topics related to job issues. "
3592,2,People's anxieties and worries were closely related with physical symptoms and self-protection methods. 
3593,2,"Although relatively appropriate to suspect physical symptoms, a high proportion of answers related to self-protection methods were assessed as misinformation or advertisements."
3594,3,Search activity for online information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak has been active. 
3595,3,Many of the online questions were related to people's anxieties and worries. 
3596,3,A considerable portion of corresponding answers had false information or were advertisements. 
3597,3,"The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public anxiety and provide appropriate information in the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, including COVID-19. "
3598,3,Our research also contributes to developing methods for measuring public opinion and sentiment in an epidemic situation based on natural language data on the internet.
3599,4,Enhancing Patient Activation and Self-Management Activities in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Using the US Department of Defense Mobile Health Care Environment: Feasibility Study
3600,0,"Past mobile health (mHealth) efforts to empower type 2 diabetes (T2D) self-management include portals, text messaging, collection of biometric data, electronic coaching, email, and collection of lifestyle information."
3601,1,"A multisite study, including a user-centered design and a controlled trial, was conducted within the US Military Health System. "
3602,1,Phase I assessed preferences regarding the enhancement of the enabling technology. 
3603,1,"Phase II was a single-blinded 12-month feasibility study that randomly assigned 240 patients to either the intervention (n=123, received mHealth technology and behavioral messages tailored to Patient Activation Measure [PAM] level at baseline) or the control group (n=117, received equipment but not messaging. "
3604,1,The primary outcome measure was PAM scores. 
3605,1,Secondary outcome measures included Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) scores and cardiometabolic outcomes. 
3606,1,We used generalized estimating equations to estimate changes in outcomes.
3607,2,The final sample consisted of 229 patients. 
3608,2,"Participants were 61.6% (141/229) male, had a mean age of 62.9 years, mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) of 7.5%, mean BMI of 32.7, and a mean duration of T2D diagnosis of 9.8 years. "
3609,2,"At month 12, the control group showed significantly greater improvements compared with the intervention group in PAM scores (control mean 7.49, intervention mean 1.77; P=.007), HbAic (control mean -0.53, intervention mean -0.11; P=.006), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (control mean -7.14, intervention mean 4.38; P=.01). "
3610,2,"Both groups showed significant improvement in SDSCA, BMI, waist size, and diastolic blood pressure; between-group differences were not statistically significant. "
3611,2,"Except for patients with the highest level of activation (PAM level 4), intervention group patients exhibited significant improvements in PAM scores. "
3612,2,"For patients with the lowest level of activation (PAM level 1), the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement compared with the control group in HbA(1c) (control mean -0.09, intervention mean -0.52; P=.04), BMI (control mean 0.58, intervention mean -1.22; P=.01), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (control mean -4.86, intervention mean 3.56; P<.001). "
3613,2,"Significant improvements were seen in AM scores, SD SCA, and waist size for both groups and in diastolic and systolic blood pressure for the control group; the between-group differences were not statistically significant. "
3614,2,"The percentage of participants who were engaged with MHCE for 50% of days period was 60.7% (68/112; months 0-3), 57.4% (62/108; months 3-6), 49.5% (51/103; months 6-9), and 43% (42/98; months 9-12)."
3615,3,Our study produced mixed results with improvement in PAM scores and outcomes in both the intervention and control groups. 
3616,3,Structural design issues may have hampered the influence of tailored behavioral messaging within the intervention group.
3617,4,Public Engagement and Government Responsiveness in the Communications About COVID-19 During the Early Epidemic Stage in China: Infodemiology Study on Social Media Data
3618,0,Effective risk communication about the outbreak of a newly emerging infectious disease in the early stage is critical for managing public anxiety and promoting behavioral compliance. 
3619,0,China has experienced the unprecedented epidemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in an era when social media has fundamentally transformed information production and consumption patterns.
3620,1,"Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020, were retrieved. "
3621,1,"Engagement data (likes, comments, shares, and followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. "
3622,1,"Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. "
3623,1,"Latent class analysis further explored main content patterns, and chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study time frame."
3624,2,The public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier for Weibo than the government. 
3625,2,Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant to COVID-19 from government agency accounts. 
3626,2,"The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situations; general knowledge of the new disease; and policies, guidelines, and official actions. "
3627,2,"However, personal posts were more likely to show empathy to affected people (chi(2)(1) =13.3, P<.001), attribute blame to other individuals or government (chi(2)(1) =28.9, P<.001), and express worry about the epidemic (chi(2)(1) =32.1, P<. "
3628,2,"001), while government posts were more likely to share instrumental support (chi(2)(1) =32.5, P<.001) and praise people or organizations (chi(2)(1) =8.7, P=.003). "
3629,2,"As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation updates (for trend, chi(2)(1) =19.7, P<.001) and policies, guidelines, and official actions (for trend, chi(2)(1) =15.3, P<.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts. "
3630,2,"Moreover, as the epidemic evolved, showing empathy and attributing blame (for trend, chi(2)(1)=25.3, P<.001) became more frequent in personal posts, corresponding to a slight increase in sharing instrumental support, praising, and empathizing in government posts (for trend, chi(2)(1)=9.0, P=.003)."
3631,3,The government should closely monitor social media data to improve the timing of communications about an epidemic. 
3632,3,"As the epidemic evolves, merely sharing situation updates and policies may be insufficient to capture public interest in the messages. "
3633,3,The government may adopt a more empathic communication style as more people are affected by the disease to address public concerns.
3634,4,Telehealth Home Support During COVID-19 Confinement for Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Mild Dementia: Survey Study
3635,0,"The public health emergency of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving worldwide; some countries, including Spain, have implemented restrictive measures. "
3636,0,Populations that are vulnerable to this outbreak and its physical and mental health effects include community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. 
3637,0,Telehealth is a potential tool to deliver health care and decrease exposure risk.
3638,1,"A telephone-based survey was administered in Spain to 93 participants in the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from March 25 to April 6, 2020."
3639,2,"Of the respondents, 60/93 (65%) were women. "
3640,2,"The mean age was 73.34 (SD 6.07), and 69/93 (74%) lived accompanied. "
3641,2,Lockdown measures forced 17/93 respondents (18%) to change their living arrangements. 
3642,2,"Health status was found to be optimal in 89/93 respondents (96%), with no COVID-19 symptoms. "
3643,2,"Grocery and pharmacy outings were performed by family members of 68/93 participants (73%); 57 (61%) reported overall well-being, and 65 (70%) maintained their sleep quality. "
3644,2,"However, participants living alone reported greater negative feelings and more sleeping problems. "
3645,2,"Regarding leisure activities, 53/93 respondents (57%) took walks, 32 (35%) played memory games, 55 (60%) watched television, and 91(98%) telephoned relatives. "
3646,2,"58/93 (64%) respondents reported accessing moderate or too much COVID-19 information, 89 (97%) received it from television, and 56 (62%) stated that their understanding of the information was extreme. "
3647,2,"39/93 (39%) respondents had contacted health and social services, while 29 (31%) requested information regarding these services during the telephone call. "
3648,2,There were no significant differences in health and well-being between the intervention and control groups. 
3649,2,"Respondents with TV-AssistDem performed more memory exercises (24/93, 52% vs 8/93, 17.4%; P<.001) than control respondents."
3650,3,"Our findings suggest that during COVID-19 confinement, the physical and mental health and well-being was optimal for the majority of our vulnerable population. "
3651,3,"However, those living alone reported greater negative psychological effects and sleeping problems. "
3652,3,"Measures adopted to address the negative experiences of confinement included keeping informed about the situation, accessing health and social services, having a support network that prevents risk of exposure to COVID-19 and guarantees food and medical supplies, a daily routine with maintained sleeping habits and leisure activities, staying physically and mentally active with cognitive stimulation exercises, and ensuring social connectedness using technology. "
3653,3,"Television sets were preferred technological devices to access COVID-19 information, watch television as a recreational activity, and perform memory exercises as an intellectual activity. "
3654,3,Television-based telehealth support using TV-AssistDem demonstrated potential for cognitive stimulation.
3655,4,Help to Overcome Problems Effectively for Cancer Survivors: Development and Evaluation of a Digital Self-Management Program
3656,0,"People living with cancer face numerous psychosocial challenges, including cancer-related fatigue, fear of recurrence, and depression. "
3657,0,There is a lack of digital interventions tailored to the needs of people living with all types of cancer. 
3658,0,"We developed a 6-week, digital, peer-delivered, self-management program: iHOPE (Help to Overcome Problems Effectively; where 'i' indicates the digital version of the program). "
3659,0,The program is underpinned by positive psychology and cognitive behavioral therapy to meet these psychosocial challenges.
3660,1,"A pre-post, acceptability, and feasibility design was used. "
3661,1,People living with cancer (N=114) were recruited via a national cancer charity in the United Kingdom and were given access to the iHOPE program. 
3662,1,Demographic and other participant characteristics were recorded. 
3663,1,"Participants completed digital measures at baseline and the end of the 6-week program for depression, anxiety, cancer-related fatigue, cancer worry or fear of cancer recurrence, positive mental well-being, hope, gratitude, and health status. "
3664,1,The website's system recorded data on the usage of the program. 
3665,1,Satisfaction with the program was also measured.
3666,2,A total of 114 participants completed the baseline questionnaires. 
3667,2,"Of these, 70 people (61.4%) participated in all 6 sessions. "
3668,2,The mean number of sessions undertaken was 5.0 (SD 1.5). 
3669,2,"Moreover, 44.7% (51/114) of participants completed at least three sessions and end-of-program outcome measures. "
3670,2,"A total of 59 participants completed the satisfaction questionnaire, where >= 90% (54/58) of participants reported that the program was easy to navigate and was well managed by the peer facilitators, and that they found the social networking tools useful. "
3671,2,"Preliminary efficacy testing among the 51 participants who completed baseline and postprogram outcome measures showed that postprogram scores decreased for depression, anxiety, cancer-related fatigue, and fear of recurrence (all P<.001) and increased for positive mental well-being (P<.001), hope (both P<.001), and gratitude (P=.02)."
3672,3,"The feasibility evidence is promising, showing that the peer-delivered digital iHOPE program is acceptable and practical. "
3673,3,Implementation of the iHOPE program on a wider scale will incorporate further research and development to maximize the completion rates of the measures. 
3674,3,Initial effectiveness data suggest positive impacts on important cancer-related quality of life and mental well-being outcomes. 
3675,3,A randomized controlled trial design with a longer follow-up is needed to confirm the potential of the iHOPE program for improving mental and physical health outcomes for cancer survivors.
3676,4,Mapping Canadian Mens Recent and Intended Health Behavior Changes Through the Dont Change Much Electronic Health Program
3677,0,"Although evaluation studies confirm the strong potential of men's electronic health (eHealth) programs, there have been calls to more fully understand acceptability, engagement, and behavior change to guide future work. "
3678,0,"Relatedly, mapping of behavior changes using health promotion theories including the transtheoretical model (or stages of change) has been recommended to build a translatable empirical base to advance design and evaluation considerations for men's eHealth programs."
3679,1,DCM users (n=863) were sampled for demographic data and self-reported recent and intended health behavior changes. 
3680,1,"Respondents also reported their usage (frequency and duration) for each of the 3 DCM components (web, newsletter, and social media) and were allocated to limited exposure (257/863, 29.8%), low exposure (431/863, 49.9%), and high exposure (175/863, 20.3%) subgroups. "
3681,1,"A benchmark sample (n=2000), comprising respondents who had not accessed DCM provided a reference group. "
3682,1,Bivariate analysis of recent and intended health behavior changes and DCM exposure levels were used to compute the strength of association between the independent variables (exposure levels) and the 10 categorical dependent variables (recent and intended health behavior changes). 
3683,1,Binary logistic regression models were computed for each of the 10 recent and intended health behavior changes. 
3684,1,Linear regression was used to model the association between the number of recent and intended changes and the level of exposure to DCM.
3685,2,"Compared with the benchmark reference group, DCM high-exposure respondents had significantly increased odds for 9 of the 10 health behavior changes, with the largest effect size observed for Changed diet or Improved eating habits (odds ratio [OR] 5.628, 95% CI 3.932-8.055). "
3686,2,"High-exposure respondents also had significantly increased odds for 9 intended health changes, with the largest effect sizes observed for Reduce stress level (OR 4.282, 95% CI 3.086-5.941). "
3687,2,"Moderate effect size (goodness of fit) was observed for increased total number of recent (F-12(,)2850 =25.52; P.001; adjusted R-2 =.093) and intended health behavior changes (F-12(,)2850 =36.30; P.001; adjusted R-2 =. "
3688,2,129) among high-exposure respondents.
3689,3,"DCM respondents contrasted the predominately precontemplative benchmark sample mapping across the contemplative, preparation, and action stages of the transtheoretical health behavior change model. "
3690,3,"Almost 10% of variation in the recent and 13% of variation in the intended health behavior changes can be explained by DCM exposure and demographic factors, indicating the acceptability of this men's eHealth resource."
3691,4,Internet Narratives Focused on Health Travelers Experiences in India: Qualitative Analysis
3692,0,"The medical tourism industry is currently popular in India, but there is no confirmation of the common perspectives among the country's medical travelers."
3693,1,Publicly available narratives written by medical tourists who visited India were obtained from a Google search. 
3694,1,The narratives included blog posts and discussion board posts by medical tourists. 
3695,1,The analysis process consisted of initial open coding being conducted on the narratives to create initial codes and identify common themes with a focus on the primary research question and subquestions.
3696,2,"Although Mumbai, Chennai, and New Delhi were not the only destination cities mentioned, these were the most popular cities patients visited for care. "
3697,2,"The medical tourists, who stated their origin country, came from one of the following continents: Africa, Europe, North America, and Oceania. "
3698,2,"Dental care, Ayurveda treatment, and eye care were the most popular types of care that medical tourists sought. "
3699,2,"The results showed that most of the medical tourists were happy with the overall experience of receiving care in India The most popular themes with regard to the patients' satisfaction were low costs, good customer service, and services being offered that were unavailable in their home country. "
3700,2,"When negative feedback was provided, it was mainly concentrated on the overall environment of India being unorganized and unsanitary."
3701,3,"Primarily, the study's findings can benefit health care providers and patients. "
3702,3,"Providers hosting medical tourists in India can use negative feedback to improve their services; similarly, providers who are losing patients to medical tourism can identify opportunities for improvement (ie, why are we losing patients) Indian providers hosting medical tourists should keep their prices competitive and continue to provide exceptional service; however, they should do their best to lessen the crowdedness of their facilities while making sure they are esthetically pleasing. "
3703,3,"Providers losing patients to medical tourism need to identify ways to ensure their services match the benefits that their international counterparts are providing, such as competitive pricing and expansion on the services provided."
3704,4,Using Machine Learning to Predict Early Onset Acute Organ Failure in Critically III Intensive Care Unit Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: Retrospective Study
3705,0,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of the red blood cells, resulting in multiple acute and chronic complications, including pain episodes, stroke, and kidney disease. "
3706,0,"Patients with SCD develop chronic organ dysfunction, which may progress to organ failure during disease exacerbations. "
3707,0,Early detection of acute physiological deterioration leading to organ failure is not always attainable Machine learning techniques that allow for prediction of organ failure may enable early identification and treatment and potentially reduce mortality.
3708,1,"We applied diverse machine learning methods, statistical methods, and data visualization techniques to develop classification models to distinguish SCD from controls."
3709,2,"We studied 63 sequential SCD patients admitted to ICUs with 163 patient encounters (mean age 30.7 years, SD 9.8 years). "
3710,2,"A subset of these patient encounters, 22.7% (37/163), met the sequential organ failure assessment criteria. "
3711,2,The other 126 SCD patient encounters served as controls. 
3712,2,"A set of signal processing features (such as fast Fourier transform, energy, and continuous wavelet transform) derived from heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate was identified to distinguish patients with SCD who developed acute physiological deterioration leading to organ failure from patients with SCD who did not meet the criteria. "
3713,2,"A multilayer perceptron model accurately predicted organ failure up to 6 hours before onset, with an average sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 98%, respectively."
3714,3,This retrospective study demonstrated the viability of using machine learning to predict acute organ failure among hospitalized adults with SCD. 
3715,3,The discovery of salient physiomarkers through machine learning techniques has the potential to further accelerate the development and implementation of innovative care delivery protocols and strategies for medically vulnerable patients.
3716,4,Successful Moderation in Online Patient Communities: Inductive Case Study
3717,0,Online patient communities are becoming more prevalent as a resource to help patients take control of their health. 
3718,0,"However, online patient communities experience challenges that require active moderation."
3719,1,An inductive case study of Mayo Clinic Connect was analyzed using the grounded theory methodology. 
3720,1,Insights for the analysis were obtained from semistructured interviews with community managers and community members. 
3721,1,"Secondary data sources, such as community management documents, observational meeting notes, and community postings, were used to validate and triangulate the findings."
3722,2,We identified four challenges unique to online patient communities. 
3723,2,"These challenges include passion, nonmedical advice, personal information, and community participation. "
3724,2,We identified five categories of practices that community members used to address these challenges and moderate the community successfully. 
3725,2,"These practices include instructive, semantic, connective, administrative, and policing practices."
3726,3,Successful moderation in online patient communities requires a multitude of practices to manage the challenges that arise in these communities. 
3727,3,Some practices are implemented as preventive measures while other practices are more interventive. 
3728,3,"Additionally, practices can come from both authority figures and exemplary members."
3729,4,Delivery of Compassionate Mental Health Care in a Digital Technology-Driven Age: Scoping Review
3730,0,"Compassion is a vital component to the achievement of positive health outcomes, particularly in mental health care. "
3731,0,"The rise of digital technologies may influence the delivery of compassionate care, and thus this relationship between compassion and digital health care needs to be better understood."
3732,1,"We conducted this scoping review through a search of Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), MEDLINE In-Process and EPub Ahead of Print, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for articles published from 1990 to 2019."
3733,2,"Of the 4472 articles screened, 37 articles were included for data extraction. "
3734,2,Telemedicine was the most widely used technology by mental health professionals. 
3735,2,Digital technologies were described as facilitating compassionate care and were classified using a conceptual model to identify each digital intersection with compassionate care. 
3736,2,"Facilitators of and barriers to providing compassionate care through digital technology were identified, including increased safety for providers, health care professional perceptions and abilities, and the use of picture-in-picture feedback to evaluate social cues."
3737,3,Implementing digital technology into mental health care can improve the current delivery of compassionate care and create novel ways to provide compassion. 
3738,3,"However, as this is a new area of study, mental health professionals and organizations alike should be mindful that compassionate human-centered care is maintained in the delivery of digital health care. "
3739,3,Future research could develop tools to facilitate and evaluate the enactment of compassion within digital health care.
3740,4,Characteristics of Patients Using Different Patient Portal Functions and the Impact on Primary Care Service Utilization and Appointment Adherence: Retrospective Observational Study
3741,0,Patient portals are now widely available and increasingly adopted by patients and providers. 
3742,0,"Despite the growing research interest in patient portal adoption, there is a lack of follow-up studies describing the following: whether patients use portals actively; how frequently they use distinct portal functions; and, consequently, what the effects of using them are, the understanding of which is paramount to maximizing the potential of patient portals to enhance care delivery."
3743,1,"A retrospective, observational study using a large dataset of 46,544 primary care patients from University of Florida Health was conducted. "
3744,1,"Patient portal users were defined as patients who adopted a portal, and adoption was defined as the status that a portal account was opened and kept activated during the study period. "
3745,1,"Then, users were further classified into different user subgroups based on their portal usage of messaging, laboratory, appointment, and medication functions. "
3746,1,"The intervention outcomes were the rates of primary care office visits categorized as arrived, telephone encounters, cancellations, and no-shows per quarter as the measures of primary care service utilization and appointment adherence. "
3747,1,Generalized linear models with a panel difference-in-differences study design were then developed to estimate the rate ratios between the users and the matched nonusers of the four measurements with an observational window of up to 10 quarters after portal adoption.
3748,2,"Interestingly, a high propensity to adopt patient portals does not necessarily imply more frequent use of portals. "
3749,2,"In particular, the number of active health problems one had was significantly negatively associated with portal adoption (odds ratios [ORs] 0.57-0.86, 95% CIs 0.51-0.94, all P<.001) but was positively associated with portal usage (ORs 1.37-1.76, 95% CIs 1.11-2.22, all P=.01). "
3750,2,"The same was true for being enrolled in Medicare for portal adoption (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.41-0.54, P<.001) and message usage (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.03-2.03, P=.04). "
3751,2,"On the impact of portal usage, the effects were time-dependent and specific to the user subgroup. "
3752,2,"The most salient change was the improvement in appointment adherence, and patients who used messaging and laboratory functions more often exhibited a larger reduction in no-shows compared to other user subgroups."
3753,3,"Patients differ in their portal adoption and usage behaviors, and the portal usage effects are heterogeneous and dynamic. "
3754,3,"However, there exists a lack of match in the patient portal market where patients who benefit the most from patient portals are not active portal adopters. "
3755,3,"Our findings suggest that health care delivery planners and administrators should remove the barriers of adoption for the portal beneficiaries; in addition, they should incorporate the impact of portal usage into care coordination and workflow design, ultimately aligning patients' and providers' needs and functionalities to effectively deliver patient-centric care."
3756,4,Digitalizing Health Services by Implementing a Personal Electronic Health Record in Germany: Qualitative Analysis of Fundamental Prerequisites From the Perspective of Selected Experts
3757,0,The implementation of a personal electronic health record (PHR) is a central objective of digitalization policies in the German health care system. 
3758,0,Corresponding legislation was passed with the 2015 Act for Secure Digital Communication and Applications in the Health Sector (eHealth Act). 
3759,0,"However, compared with other European countries, Germany still lags behind concerning the implementation of a PHR."
3760,1,"A total of 33 semistructured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of experts: 23 interviews with different health care professionals and 10 interviews with key actors of the German health care system who were telematics, eHealth, and information technology experts (eHealth experts). "
3761,1,The interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to a content analysis.
3762,2,"From the expert perspective, a PHR was basically considered desirable and unavoidable. "
3763,2,"At the same time, a number of challenges for implementation in Germany have been outlined. "
3764,2,"Three crucial themes emerged: (1) documentation standards: prevailing processes of the analog bureaucratic paper world, (2) interoperability: the plurality of actors and electronic systems, and (3) political structure: the lack of clear political regulations and political incentive structures."
3765,3,"With regard to the implementation of a PHR, an important precondition of a successful digitalization will be the precedent reform of the system to be digitized. "
3766,3,Whether the recently passed Act for Faster Appointments and Better Care will be a step in the right direction remains to be seen.
3767,4,Clinically Meaningful Use of Mental Health Apps and its Effects on Depression: Mixed Methods Study
3768,0,User engagement is key to the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions. 
3769,0,"Considerable research has examined the clinical outcomes of overall engagement with mental health apps (eg, frequency and duration of app use). "
3770,0,"However, few studies have examined how specific app use behaviors can drive change in outcomes. "
3771,0,Understanding the clinical outcomes of more nuanced app use could inform the design of mental health apps that are more clinically effective to users.
3772,1,We conducted a secondary analysis of system use data from an 8-week randomized trial of a suite of 13 mental health apps. 
3773,1,We categorized app use behaviors through a mixed methods analysis combining qualitative content analysis and principal component analysis. 
3774,1,Regression analyses were used to assess the association between app use and levels of depression and anxiety at the end of treatment.
3775,2,"A total of 3 distinct clusters of app use behaviors were identified: learning, goal setting, and self-tracking. "
3776,2,Each specific behavior had varied effects on outcomes. 
3777,2,"Participants who engaged in self-tracking experienced reduced depression symptoms, and those who engaged with learning and goal setting at a moderate level (ie, not too much or not too little) also had an improvement in depression. "
3778,2,"Notably, the combination of these 3 types of behaviors, what we termed ""clinically meaningful use,"" accounted for roughly the same amount of variance as explained by the overall intensity of app use (ie, total number of app use sessions). "
3779,2,This suggests that our categorization of app use behaviors succeeded in capturing app use associated with better outcomes. 
3780,2,"However, anxiety outcomes were neither associated with specific behaviors nor generic app use."
3781,3,This study presents the first granular examination of user interactions with mental health apps and their effects on mental health outcomes. 
3782,3,It has important implications for the design of mobile health interventions that aim to achieve greater user engagement and improved clinical efficacy.
3783,4,Adapting the eHealth Literacy Scale for Carers of People With Chronic Diseases (eHeals-Carer) in a Sample of Greek and Cypriot Carers of People With Dementia: Reliability and Validation Study
3784,0,"As the population ages, many more people will be in need of long-term care. "
3785,0,"According to a recent report by Alzheimer's Disease International and the Karolinska Institute, 84% of people with dementia are cared for at home and 16% in nursing homes. "
3786,0,Several Web-based interventions have been developed to assist the work of carers at home. 
3787,0,Measuring the levels of electronic health (eHealth) literacy is of top priority to facilitate inclusion of this population and develop training programs to enhance eHealth literacy skills.
3788,1,The content validity of the eHealth Literacy Scale for Carers of People With Chronic Diseases (eHeals-Carer) was assessed with an expert panel (N=10). 
3789,1,A descriptive study with face-to-face interviews among 101 primary carers of people with dementia was conducted. 
3790,1,"In addition to the eHeals-Carer to assess their perceived eHealth literacy, participants responded to a brief questionnaire regarding characteristics of internet use and provided sociodemographic data. "
3791,1,The internal consistency of the tool and the construct validity via an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were explored.
3792,2,The Mean Item-Level Content Validity Index (CVI) and Scale-Level CVI Average was 0.93. 
3793,2,"The participants were mostly women (75.2%, 76/101), aged less than 60 years (67.3%, 68/101) with secondary education. "
3794,2,The internal consistency was estimated at a Cronbach alpha of.83. 
3795,2,Two factors were extracted from the EFA: information seeking questions 1 to 5 (factor 1) and evaluation questions 6 to 8 (factor 2).
3796,3,eHeals-Carer is the first perceived eHealth literacy tool adapted for carers of people with dementia. 
3797,3,The use of Web-based services available for carers could help them and improve the health care system in the long term. 
3798,3,"In Greece and Cyprus, there is a lack of services, and improving"
3799,4,Quantifying Use of a Health Virtual Community of Practice for General Practitioners Continuing Professional Development: A Novel Methodology and Pilot Evaluation
3800,0,"Health care practitioners (HPs), in particular general practitioners (GPs), are increasingly adopting Web-based social media platforms for continuing professional development (CPD). "
3801,0,"As GPs are restricted by time, distance, and demanding workloads, a health virtual community of practice (HVCoP) is an ideal solution to replace face-to-face CPD with Web-based CPD. "
3802,0,"However, barriers such as time and work schedules may limit participation in an HVCoP. "
3803,0,"Furthermore, it is difficult to gauge whether GPs engage actively or passively in HVCoP knowledge-acquisition for Web-based CPD, as GPs' competencies are usually measured with pre- and posttests."
3804,1,A prototype CFC Learning Hub was developed using an Igloo Web-based social media software platform and involved a convenience sample of GPs interested in bone health topics. 
3805,1,"This Hub, a secure Web-based community site, included 2 key components: an online discussion forum and a knowledge repository (the Knowledge Hub). "
3806,1,The discussion forum contained anonymized case studies (contributed by GP participants) and topical discussions (topics that were not case studies). 
3807,1,"Using 2 complementary tools (Google Analytics and Igloo Statistical Tool), we characterized individual participating GPs' engagement with the Hub. "
3808,1,"We measured the GP participants' behavior by quantifying the number of online sessions of the participants, activities undertaken within these online sessions, written posts made per learning topic, and their time spent per topic. "
3809,1,We calculated time spent in both active and passive engagement for each topic.
3810,2,Seven GPs participated in the CFC Learning Hub HVCoP from September to November 2017. 
3811,2,The complementary tools successfully captured the GP participants' engagement in the Hub. 
3812,2,"GPs were more active in topics in the discussion forum that had direct clinical application as opposed to didactic, evidence-based discussion topics (ie, topical discussions). "
3813,2,"From our knowledge hub, About Osteoporosis and Prevention were the most engaging topics, whereas shared decision making was the least active topic."
3814,3,"We showcased a novel complementary analysis method that allowed us to quantify the CFC Learning Hub's usage data into (1) sessions, (2) activities, (3) active or passive time spent, and (4) posts made to evaluate the potential engagement features needed for an HVCoP focused on GP participants' CPD process. "
3815,3,Our design and evaluation methods for ongoing use and engagement in this Hub may be useful to evaluate future learning and knowledge-sharing projects for GPs and may allow for extension to other HPs' environments. 
3816,3,"However, owing to the limited number of GP participants in this study, we suggest that further research with a larger cohort should be performed to validate and extend these findings."
3817,4,A Scale to Assess the Methodological Quality of Studies Assessing Usability of Electronic Health Products and Services: Delphi Study Followed by Validity and Reliability Testing
3818,0,The usability of electronic health (eHealth) and mobile health apps is of paramount importance as it impacts the quality of care. 
3819,0,Methodological quality assessment is a common practice in the field of health for different designs and types of studies. 
3820,0,"However, we were unable to find a scale to assess the methodological quality of studies on the usability of eHealth products or services."
3821,1,A 3-round Delphi panel was used to generate a pool of items considered important when assessing the quality of studies on the usability of mobile apps. 
3822,1,These items were used to write the scale and the guide to assist its use. 
3823,1,"The scale was then used to assess the quality of studies on usability of mobile apps for physical activity, and it assessed in terms of feasibility, interrater reliability, and construct validity."
3824,2,"A total of 25 experts participated in the Delphi panel, and a 15-item scale was developed. "
3825,2,"This scale was shown to be feasible (time of application mean 13.10 [SD 2.59] min), reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.81; 95% CI 0.55-0.93), and able to discriminate between low- and high-quality studies (high quality: mean 9.22 [SD 0.36]; low quality: mean 6.86 [SD 0.80]; P=.01)."
3826,3,The scale that was developed can be used both to assess the methodological quality of usability studies and to inform its planning.
3827,4,Development of an Instructional Design Evaluation Survey for Postgraduate Medical E-Learning: Content Validation Study
3828,0,E-Learning has taken a firm place in postgraduate medical education. 
3829,0,"Whereas 10 years ago it was promising, it now has a definite niche and is clearly here to stay. "
3830,0,"However, evaluating the effect of postgraduate medical e-learning (PGMeL) and improving upon it can be complicated. "
3831,0,"While the learning aims of e-learning are evaluated, there are no instruments to evaluate the instructional design of PGMeL. "
3832,0,Such an evaluation instrument may be developed by following the Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE) 7-step process. 
3833,0,"The first 5 steps of this process were previously performed by literature reviews, focus group discussion, and an international Delphi study."
3834,1,"There are five phases in this study: creating a survey from 37 items (phase A); testing readability and question interpretation (phase B); adjusting, rewriting, and translating surveys (phase C); gathering completed surveys from three PGMeL modules (phase D); and holding focus group discussions with the e-learning authors (phase E). "
3835,1,"Phase E was carried out by presenting the results of the evaluations from phase D, followed by a group discussion. "
3836,1,There are four groups of participants in this study. 
3837,1,Groups A and B are experienced end users of PGMeL and participated in phase B. 
3838,1,Group C are users who undertook e-learning and were asked to complete the survey in phase D. 
3839,1,Group D are the authors of the e-learning modules described above.
3840,2,"From a list of 36 items, we developed a postgraduate Medical E-Learning Evaluation Survey (MEES). "
3841,2,"Seven residents participated in the phase B group discussion: 4 items were interpreted differently, 3 were not readable, and 2 items were double. "
3842,2,"The items from phase B were rewritten and, after adjustment, understood correctly. "
3843,2,The MEES was translated into Dutch and again pilot-tested. 
3844,2,All items were clear and were understood correctly. 
3845,2,"The MEES version used for the evaluation contained 3 positive domains (motivation, learning enhancers, and real-world translation) and 2 negative domains (barriers and learning discouragers), with 36 items in those domains, 5 Likert scale questions of 1 to 10, and 5 open questions asking participants to give their own comments in each domain. "
3846,2,Three e-learning modules were evaluated from July to November 2018. 
3847,2,"There were a total of 158 responses from a Dutch module, a European OB/GYN (obstetrics and gynecology) module, and a surgical module offered worldwide. "
3848,2,"Finally, 3 focus group discussions took place with a total of 10 participants. "
3849,2,"Usefulness was much appreciated, understandability was good, and added value was high. "
3850,2,"Four items needed additional explanation by the authors, and a Creators' Manual was written at their request."
3851,3,The MEES is the first survey to evaluate the instructional design of PGMeL and was constructed following all 7 steps of the AMEE. 
3852,3,This study completes the design of the survey and shows its usefulness and added value to the authors. 
3853,3,"It finishes with a final, publicly available survey that includes a Creators' Manual. "
3854,3,"We briefly discuss the number of responses needed and conclude that more is better; in the end, however, one has to work with what is available. "
3855,3,The next steps would be to see whether improvement can be measured by using the MEES and continue to work on the end understandability in different languages and cultural groups.
3856,4,Quantitative Ratings and Narrative Comments on Swiss Physician Rating Websites: Frequency Analysis
3857,0,"Physician rating websites (PRWs) have been developed as part of a wider move toward transparency around health care quality, and these allow patients to anonymously rate, comment, and discuss physicians' quality on the Web. "
3858,0,"The first Swiss PRWs were established in 2008, at the same time as many international PRWs. "
3859,0,"However, there has been limited research conducted on PRWs in Switzerland to date. "
3860,0,International research has indicated that a key shortcoming of PRWs is that they have an insufficient number of ratings.
3861,1,"In November 2017, a random stratified sample of 966 physicians was generated from the regions of Ziirich and Geneva. "
3862,1,"Every selected physician was searched for on 4 rating websites (OkDoc, DocApp, Medicosearch, and Google) between November 2017 and July 2018. "
3863,1,"It was recorded whether the physician could be identified, what the physician's quantitative rating was, and whether the physician had received narrative comments. "
3864,1,"In addition, Alexa Internet was used to examine the number of visitors to the PRWs, compared with other websites."
3865,2,"Overall, the portion of physicians able to be identified on the PRWs ranged from 42.4% (410/966) on OkDoc to 87.3% (843/966) on DocApp. "
3866,2,"Of the identifiable physicians, only a few of the selected physicians had been rated quantitatively (4.5% [38/843] on DocApp to 49.8% [273/548] on Google) or received narrative comments (4.5% [38/843] on DocApp to 31.2% [171/548] on Google) at least once. "
3867,2,"Rated physicians also had, on average, a low number of quantitative ratings (1.47 ratings on OkDoc to 3.74 rating on Google) and narrative comments (1.23 comment on OkDoc to 3.03 comments on Google). "
3868,2,"All 3 websites allowing ratings used the same rating scale (1-5 stars) and had a very positive average rating: DocApp (4.71), Medicosearch (4.69), and Google (4.41). "
3869,2,There were significant differences among the PRWs (with the majority of ratings being posted on Google in past 2 years) and regions (with physicians in Zurich more likely to have been rated and have more ratings on average). 
3870,2,"Only Google (position 1) and Medicosearch (position 8358) are placed among the top 10,000 visited websites in Switzerland."
3871,3,It appears that this is the first time Google has been included in a study examining physician ratings internationally and it is noticeable how Google has had substantially more ratings than the 3 dedicated PRWs in Switzerland over the past 2 and a half years. 
3872,3,"Overall, this study indicates that Swiss PRWs are not yet a reliable source of unbiased information regarding patient experiences and satisfaction with Swiss physicians; many selected physicians were unable to be identified, only a few physicians had been rated, and the ratings posted were overwhelmingly positive."
3873,4,"Digital Mental Health Interventions for Depression, Anxiety, and Enhancement of Psychological Well-Being Among College Students: Systematic Review"
3874,0,"College students are increasingly reporting common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and they frequently encounter barriers to seeking traditional mental health treatments. "
3875,0,"Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via the Web and apps, offer the potential to improve access to mental health treatment."
3876,1,"We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (registration number CRD42018092800), and the search strategy was conducted by a medical research librarian in the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EbscoHost), the Cochrane Library (Wiley), and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) from the date of inception to April 2019. "
3877,1,"Data were synthesized using a systematic narrative synthesis framework, and formal quality assessments were conducted to address the risk of bias."
3878,2,A total of 89 studies met the inclusion criteria. 
3879,2,"The majority of interventions (71/89, 80%) were delivered via a website, and the most common intervention was internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (28, 31%). "
3880,2,"Many programs (33, 37%) featured human support in the form of coaching. "
3881,2,"The majority of programs were either effective (42, 47%) or partially effective (30, 34%) in producing beneficial changes in the main psychological outcome variables. "
3882,2,"Approximately half of the studies (45, 51%) did not present any usability or acceptability outcomes, and few studies (4, 4%) examined a broad implementation of digital mental health interventions on college campuses. "
3883,2,Quality assessments revealed a moderate-to-severe risk of bias in many of the studies.
3884,3,"Results suggest that digital mental health interventions can be effective for improving depression, anxiety, and psychological well-being among college students, but more rigorous studies are needed to ascertain the effective elements of these interventions. "
3885,3,"Continued research on improving the user experience of, and thus user engagement with, these programs appears vital for the sustainable implementation of digital mental health interventions on college"
3886,4,Validation of the Electronic International Index of Erectile Function IIEF-5 and IIEF-15: A Crossover Study
3887,0,"Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used to measure patient's perspective of functional well-being, disease burden, treatment effectiveness, and clinical decision making. "
3888,0,Electronic versions are increasingly feasible because of smartphone and tablet usage. 
3889,0,"However, validation of these electronic PROMs (ePROMs) is warranted for justified implementation. "
3890,0,The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) 5 and 15 are widely used PROMs in urology to measure erectile dysfunction. 
3891,0,Measurement reliability and validity testing of the IIEF ePROMs are essential before clinical application.
3892,1,This study included 179 patients from our urology outpatient clinic. 
3893,1,It also had a randomized crossover design-participants completed either a paper and electronic IIEF-5 or 15 or twice completed an electronic version-with a 5-day delay. 
3894,1,"Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach alpha and Spearman-Brown coefficient, test-retest reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and convergent validity using the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficient."
3895,2,A total of 122 participants completed the study. 
3896,2,Internal consistency was excellent for the electronic IIEF-5 (ICC 0.902) and good to excellent for the domains of the IIEF-15 (ICC 0.962-0.834). 
3897,2,Test-retest reliability was excellent for the IIEF-5 (ICC 0.924) and good to excellent for the domains of the IIEF-15 (ICC 0.950-0.778). 
3898,2,"Convergent validity was excellent for the IIEF-5 and IIEF-15, with a correlation of r=0.923 and r=0.951, respectively."
3899,3,We successfully introduced patient-acceptable ePROM versions of the IIEF-5 and IIEF-15. 
3900,3,"This study's results demonstrate that the ePROM versions of the IIEF-5 and IIEF-15 can be reliably implemented, as outcomes are reliable and in accordance with findings of the paper version."
3901,4,An Internet-Based Self-Testing Model (Easy Test): Cross-Sectional Survey Targeting Men Who Have Sex With Men Who Never Tested for HIV in 14 Provinces of China
3902,0,"With China's explosive internet growth, activities such as socializing and partner seeking among men who have sex with men (MSM) has also become Web based through popular services such as Blued. "
3903,0,"This creates a new mode of health promotion with the potential to instantly reach large numbers of MSM, including those who rarely access traditional offline testing facilities."
3904,1,A feasibility study of the Easy Test model was conducted from October 2017 to December 2017 in 14 Chinese provinces. 
3905,1,Applicants who provided informed consent completed a self-administered questionnaire and submitted a US $5 deposit to have the free test kit delivered to their homes. 
3906,1,"Orders were then received, processed, and posted by volunteers from local community-based organizations. "
3907,1,"Once applicants submitted images of their test results, the deposit was refunded to the applicant. "
3908,1,Those whose test results were deemed to be HIV-positive were then connected to a peer navigator to accompany the individual to follow-up medical services. 
3909,1,A chi-squared trend test was used to assess the relationship between lifetime HIV testing volume and HIV prevalence. 
3910,1,Logistic regression models were used to identify independent risk factors associated with two outcomes: (1) never having tested for HIV and (2) receiving an HIV-positive result.
3911,2,A total of 879 individuals submitted Web-based requests for test kits. 
3912,2,"Their median age was 28 (interquartile range 24-34 years); 69.3% (609/879) had at least a college education, and 51.5% (453/879) had a monthly income between US $ 450 to $ 750; 77.7% (683/879) of the applicants submitted images of their test results, among whom 14.3% (98/683) had an HIV-positive result. "
3913,2,"Among the 42.9% (293/683) who were first-time testers, the HIV prevalence was 18.8% (55/293). "
3914,2,"Nearly three-quarters (71/98, 72.4%) of those with a positive test result were connected with a peer navigator and enrolled in treatment. "
3915,2,"Among the first-time testers, having multiple sexual partners (2-3 sexual partners: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.44, 95% CI 1.08-5.50; 4 or above sexual partners: aOR 3.55, 95% CI 1.18-10.68) and reporting inconsistent condom use in the previous 3 months (aOR 7.95, 95% CI 3.66-17.26) were both associated with an HIV-positive result. "
3916,2,An inverse dose response relationship between lifetime HIV testing volume and HIV prevalence was also observed in this study (chi(2)(3)= 55.0; P<.001).
3917,3,"The Easy Test model reached a larger portion of first-time testers, many who reported higher risk sexual behaviors. "
3918,3,This highlights the potential for an internet-based self-test model to increase access to HIV treatment services for HIV-positive MSM in China.
3919,4,Clinical Efficacy of Telemedicine Compared to Face-to-Face Clinic Visits for Smoking Cessation: Multicenter Open-Label Randomized Controlled Noninferiority Trial
3920,0,Tobacco is a major public health concern. 
3921,0,"A 12-week standard smoking cessation program is available in Japan; however, it requires face-to-face clinic visits, which has been one of the key obstacles to completing the program, leading to a low smoking cessation success rate. "
3922,0,Telemedicine using internet-based video counseling instead of regular clinic visits could address this obstacle.
3923,1,"This study was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial. "
3924,1,We recruited nicotine-dependent adults from March to June 2018. 
3925,1,"Participants randomized to the telemedicine arm received internet-based video counseling, whereas control participants received standard face-to-face clinic visits at each time point in the smoking cessation program. "
3926,1,Both arms received a CureApp Smoking Cessation smartphone app with a mobile exhaled carbon monoxide checker. 
3927,1,The primary outcome was a continuous abstinence rate (CAR) from weeks 9 to 12. 
3928,1,Full analysis set was used for data analysis.
3929,2,"We randomized 115 participants with nicotine dependence: 58 were allocated to the telemedicine (internet-based video counseling) arm and 57, to the control (standard face-to-face clinical visit) arm. "
3930,2,We analyzed all 115 participants for the primary outcome. 
3931,2,"Both telemedicine and control groups had similar CARs from weeks 9 to 12 (81.0% vs 78.9%; absolute difference, 2.1%; 95% CI -12.8 to 17.0), and the lower limit of the difference between groups (-12.8%) was greater than the prespecified limit (-15%)."
3932,3,The application of telemedicine using internet-based video counseling as a smoking cessation program had a similar CAR from weeks 9 to 12 as that of the standard face-to-face clinical visit program. 
3933,3,The efficacy of the telemedicine-based smoking cessation program was not inferior to that of the standard visit-based smoking cessation program.
3934,4,Clinicians Concerns About Mobile Ecological Momentary Assessment Tools Designed for Emerging Psychiatric Problems: Prospective Acceptability Assessment of the MEmind App
3935,0,Many mental disorders are preceded by a prodromal phase consisting of various attenuated and unspecific symptoms and functional impairment. 
3936,0,Electronic health records are generally used to capture these symptoms during medical consultation. 
3937,0,Internet and mobile technologies provide the opportunity to monitor symptoms emerging in patients' environments using ecological momentary assessment techniques to support preventive therapeutic decision making.
3938,1,We recruited clinicians at 4 community psychiatry departments in France to participate. 
3939,1,They used the app to assess patients and to collect data after viewing a video of a young patient's emerging psychiatric consultation. 
3940,1,"We then asked them to answer a short anonymous self-administered questionnaire that evaluated their experience, the acceptability of the app, and their habit of using new technologies."
3941,2,"Of 24 practitioners invited, 21 (88%) agreed to participate. "
3942,2,"Most of them were between 25 and 45 years old, and greater age was not associated with poorer acceptability. "
3943,2,"Most of the practitioners regularly used new technologies, and 95% (20/21) connected daily to the internet, with 70% (15/21) connecting 3 times a day or more. "
3944,2,"However, only 57% (12/21) reported feeling comfortable with computers. "
3945,2,"Of the clinicians, 86% (18/21) would recommend the tool to their colleagues and 67% (14/21) stated that they would be interested in daily use of the app. "
3946,2,"Most of the clinicians (16/21, 76%) found the interface easy to use and useful. "
3947,2,"However, several clinicians noted the lack of readability (8/21, 38%) and the need to improve ergonometric features (4/21, 19%), in particular to facilitate browsing through various subsections. "
3948,2,"Some participants (5/21, 24%) were concerned about the storage of medical data and most of them (11/21, 52%) seemed to be uncomfortable with this."
3949,3,We describe the first step of the development of a Web app combining an electronic health record and ecological momentary assessment features. 
3950,3,This online tool offers the possibility to assess patients and to integrate medical data easily into face-to-face conditions. 
3951,3,The acceptability of this app supports the feasibility of its broader implementation. 
3952,3,This app could help to standardize assessment and to build up a strong database. 
3953,3,"Used in conjunction with robust data mining analytic techniques, such a database would allow exploration of risk factors, patterns of symptom evolution, and identification of distinct risk subgroups."
3954,4,Digital Technology for Internet Access by Patients With Early-Stage Schizophrenia in Spain: Multicenter Research Study
3955,0,"Digital technology and social networks are part of everyday life in the current internet age, especially among young people. "
3956,0,"To date, few studies have been published worldwide on the pattern of use of digital technology devices and applications in patients with early-stage schizophrenia and even fewer comparing them with healthy participants (not using data from general population surveys) from the same demographic areas. "
3957,0,"In Spain, no such study has been carried out."
3958,1,"A cross-sectional, multicentric study was carried out through a semistructured interview asking about the use of digital technology devices and internet. "
3959,1,The sample comprised 90 patients and 90 healthy participants. 
3960,1,"The semistructured interview was conducted on 30 outpatients and 30 healthy subjects in each of the 3 different cities (Madrid, Alicante, and Cuenca). "
3961,1,Student t test was used for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. 
3962,1,"In the case of ordinal variables, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis H tests for independent samples were performed to compare groups."
3963,2,The results indicated that a large proportion of patients with early-stage schizophrenia have access to different digital devices and use them frequently. 
3964,2,"In addition, both groups coincide in the order of preference and the purpose for which they use the devices. "
3965,2,"However, a lower frequency of use of most digital technology devices was detected in patients compared with healthy participants. "
3966,2,"In the case of some devices, this was due to the impossibility of access and not a lack of interest."
3967,3,"To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze patterns of internet access and use of digital technology devices and applications in Spanish patients with early-stage schizophrenia compared with healthy participants from the same demographic areas. "
3968,3,"The results on significant access and use of digital technology and internet shown in this cross-sectional study will allow enhanced and more efficient treatment strategies to be planned, utilizing digital technology devices, for patients with early-stage schizophrenia."
3969,4,Exploring How Evidence is Used in Care Through an Organizational Ethnography of Two Teaching Hospitals
3970,0,Numerous published articles show that clinicians do not follow clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). 
3971,0,"However, a few studies explore what clinicians consider evidence and how they use different forms of evidence in their care decisions. "
3972,0,Many of these existing studies occurred before the advent of smartphones and advanced Web-based information retrieval technologies. 
3973,0,It is important to understand how these new technologies influence the ways clinicians use evidence in their clinical practice. 
3974,0,"Mindlines are a concept that explores how clinicians draw on different sources of information (including context, experience, medical training, and evidence) to develop collectively reinforced, internalized tacit guidelines."
3975,1,We draw on ethnographic data collected by shadowing internal medicine teams at 2 teaching hospitals. 
3976,1,"Fieldnotes were tagged by evidence category, teaching and care, and role of the person referencing evidence. "
3977,1,Counts of these tags were integrated with fieldnote vignettes and memos. 
3978,1,The findings were verified with an advisory council and through member checks.
3979,2,CPGs represent just one of several sources of evidence used when making care decisions. 
3980,2,"Some forms of evidence were predominately invoked from mindlines, whereas other forms were read to supplement mindlines The majority of scientific evidence was accessed on the Web, often through smartphones. "
3981,2,How evidence was used varied by role. 
3982,2,"As team members gained experience, they increasingly incorporated evidence into their mindlines Evidence was often blended together to arrive at shared understandings and approaches to patient care that included ways to filter evidence."
3983,3,This paper outlines one way through which the ethos of evidence-based medicine has been incorporated into the daily work of care. 
3984,3,"Here, multiple Web-based forms of evidence were mixed with other information. "
3985,3,This is different from the way that is often articulated by health administrators and policy makers whereby clinical practice guideline adherence is equated with practicing evidence-based medicine.
3986,4,Detecting Hypoglycemia Incidents Reported in Patients Secure Messages: Using Cost-Sensitive Learning and Oversampling to Reduce Data Imbalance
3987,0,"Improper dosing of medications such as insulin can cause hypoglycemic episodes, which may lead to severe morbidity or even death. "
3988,0,"Although secure messaging was designed for exchanging nonurgent messages, patients sometimes report hypoglycemia events through secure messaging. "
3989,0,Detecting these patient-reported adverse events may help alert clinical teams and enable early corrective actions to improve patient safety.
3990,1,An expert in public health annotated 3000 secure message threads between patients with diabetes and US Department of Veterans Affairs clinical teams as containing patient-reported hypoglycemia incidents or not. 
3991,1,A physician independently annotated 100 threads randomly selected from this dataset to determine interannotator agreement. 
3992,1,We used this dataset to develop and evaluate HypoDetect. 
3993,1,"HypoDetect incorporates 3 machine learning algorithms widely used for text classification: linear support vector machines, random forest, and logistic regression. "
3994,1,"We explored different learning features, including new knowledge-driven features. "
3995,1,"Because only 114 (3.80%) messages were annotated as positive, we investigated cost-sensitive learning and oversampling methods to mitigate the challenge of imbalanced data."
3996,2,The interannotator agreement was Cohen kappa=.976. 
3997,2,"Using cross-validation, logistic regression with cost-sensitive learning achieved the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.954, sensitivity=0.693, specificity 0.974, F1 score=0.590). "
3998,2,Cost-sensitive learning and the ensembled synthetic minority oversampling technique improved the sensitivity of the baseline systems substantially (by 0.123 to 0.728 absolute gains). 
3999,2,Our results show that a variety of features contributed to the best performance of HypoDetect.
4000,3,"Despite the challenge of data imbalance, HypoDetect achieved promising results for the task of detecting hypoglycemia incidents from secure messages. "
4001,3,The system has a great potential to facilitate early detection and treatment of hypoglycemia.
4002,4,"The Digital Education to Limit Salt in the Home Program Improved Salt-Related Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors in Parents"
4003,0,"Currently, Australian children and adults are eating too much salt, increasing their risk of cardiovascular-related conditions. "
4004,0,"Web-based programs provide an avenue to engage the parents of primary schoolchildren in salt-specific messages, which may positively impact their own salt-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KABs)."
4005,1,"The DELISH program was a 5-week, home-delivered, Web-based intervention, with a pre- and posttest design, targeting schoolchildren aged 7 to 10 years and their parents. "
4006,1,Parents received weekly Web-based educational newsletters and text messages and completed online pre- and postprogram surveys assessing salt-related KABs. 
4007,1,"Upon completion of the program, all parents were also invited to complete an online evaluation survey. "
4008,1,Changes in KABs outcomes were assessed using McNemar tests and paired t tests.
4009,2,"Of the 80 parents that commenced the program, 73 parents (mean age 41.0, SD 7.0 years; 86% (63/73) females) completed both pre- and postsurveys. "
4010,2,"Overall, mean score for salt-related knowledge improved (+3.6 [standard error (SE) 0.41] points), and mean behavior score also improved (+4.5 [SE 0.61] points), indicating a higher frequency of engaging in behaviors to reduce salt in the diet, and mean attitude score decreased (-0.7 [SE 0.19] points), representing lower importance of using salt to enhance the taste of food (all P<. "
4011,2,001). 
4012,2,"Following participation, the proportion of parents aware of the daily salt intake recommendation increased from 40% (29/73) to 74% (54/73) (P<. "
4013,2,"001), and awareness of bread as the main source of salt increased from 58% (42/73) to 95% (69/73) (P<. "
4014,2,001). 
4015,2,The proportion of parents who agreed that salt should be used in cooking to enhance the flavor of food decreased from 30% (22/73) to 11% (8/73) (P=.002) and the proportion who agreed that sodium information displayed on food labels was difficult to understand decreased from 52% (38/73) to 32% (23/73) (P=.009). 
4016,2,There was a reduction in the proportion of parents who reported adding salt during cooking (55% [40/73] vs 41% [30/73]; P=.03) and at the table (32% [23/73] vs 18% [13/73]; P=.002). 
4017,2,"Of the 16 parents who completed the evaluation survey, 75% (12/16) enjoyed the program, and all parents found the newsletters to be useful. "
4018,2,"Almost all parents (15/16, 94%) agreed that the DELISH program would be useful to other parents."
4019,3,"The improvement in salt-related KABs in the DELISH program indicates the potential for online technology, to disseminate simple salt reduction education messages to families with primary school-aged children. "
4020,3,Future work should seek to improve the quality of data collected by including a larger sample size and a control group to integrate the program within the school setting to enable wider dissemination.
4021,4,Cardiac Rehabilitees Technology Experiences Before Remote Rehabilitation: Qualitative Study Using a Grounded Theory Approach
4022,0,"Even though technology is becoming increasingly common in rehabilitation programs, insufficient data are as yet available on rehabilitees' perceptions and experiences. "
4023,0,It is important to understand their abilities when using technology for remote rehabilitation.
4024,1,Qualitative interviews were conducted with 39 rehabilitees in four focus groups. 
4025,1,The subjects were aged 34 to 77 years (average age 54.8 years) and 74% (29/39) of them were male. 
4026,1,They had been diagnosed with coronary artery disease and were undergoing treatment in a rehabilitation center. 
4027,1,The interviews were conducted between September 2015 and November 2016. 
4028,1,Data were analyzed using Glaser's mode of the grounded theory approach.
4029,2,"The result of the study was an ""identifying e-usage"" experience category, which refers to the rehabilitees' notions of the use of information and communication technologies (e-usage) in the process of behavior change. "
4030,2,The main category comprises four subcategories that define the rehabilitees' technology experience. 
4031,2,"These subcategories are ""feeling outsider,"" "" being uninterested,"" "" reflecting benefit,"" and "" enthusiastic using."" All rehabilitees expected that technology should be simple, flexible, and easy to use and learn. "
4032,2,The results reflecting their technology experience can be used in e-rehabilitation programs. 
4033,2,"Rehabilitees who feel like outsiders and are not interested in technology need face-to-face communication for the major part of rehabilitation, while rehabilitees who reflect benefit and are enthusiastic about the use of technology need incrementally less face-to-face interaction and feel that Web-based coaching could offer sufficient support for rehabilitation."
4034,3,"The findings show that persons affected by heart disease had different experiences with technology and expectations toward counseling, while all rehabilitees expected technology to be easy to use and their experiences to be smooth and problem-free. "
4035,3,The results can be used more widely in different contexts of social and health care for the planning of and training in remote rehabilitation counseling and education.
4036,4,Identifying Brief Message Content for Interventions Delivered via Mobile Devices to Improve Medication Adherence in People With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Rapid Systematic Review
4037,0,Current interventions to support medication adherence in people with type 2 diabetes are generally resource-intensive and ineffective. 
4038,0,"Brief messages, such as those delivered via short message service (SMS) systems, are increasingly used in digital health interventions to support adherence because they can be delivered on a wide scale and at low cost. "
4039,0,"The content of SMS text messages is a crucial intervention feature for promoting behavior change, but it is often unclear what the rationale is for chosen wording or any underlying mechanisms targeted for behavioral change. "
4040,0,There is little guidance for developing and optimizing brief message content for use in mobile device-delivered interventions.
4041,1,A rapid systematic review of existing relevant systematic reviews was conducted. 
4042,1,"MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to April 10, 2017. "
4043,1,"Inclusion criteria were (1) systematic reviews of quantitative data if the studies reviewed identified predictors of or correlates with medication adherence or evaluated medication adherence-enhancing interventions and included adult participants taking medication to manage a chronic physical health condition, and (2) systematic reviews of qualitative studies of experiences of medication adherence for adult participants with type 2 diabetes. "
4044,1,"Data were extracted on review characteristics and BCTs, theoretical constructs, or behavioral strategies associated with improved adherence. "
4045,1,Constructs and strategies were mapped onto the BCT version 1 taxonomy.
4046,2,"A total of 1701 references were identified; 25 systematic reviews (19 quantitative reviews, 3 qualitative reviews, and 3 mixed-method reviews) were included. "
4047,2,"Moreover, 20 theoretical constructs (eg, self-efficacy) and 19 behavioral strategies (eg, habit analysis) were identified in the included reviews. "
4048,2,"In total, 46 BCTs were identified as being related to medication adherence in type 2 diabetes (eg, habit formation, prompts or cues, and information about health consequences)."
4049,3,We identified 46 promising BCTs related to medication adherence in type 2 diabetes on which the content of brief messages delivered through mobile devices to improve adherence could be based. 
4050,3,"By using explicit systematic review methods and linking our findings to a standardized taxonomy of BCTs, we have described a novel approach for the development of digital message content. "
4051,3,Future brief message interventions that aim to support medication adherence could incorporate the identified BCTs.
4052,4,"The Effect of Using Geosocial Networking Apps on the HIV Incidence Rate Among Men Who Have Sex With Men: Eighteen-Month Prospective Cohort Study in Shenyang, China"
4053,0,Men who have sex with men (MSM) frequently seek partners through mobile apps (geosocial networking [GSN] apps). 
4054,0,"However, it is unclear whether GSN apps' use is associated with the increase in HIV incidence among MSM."
4055,1,"We conducted an 18-month prospective cohort study of MSM in Shenyang, China, and the participants were surveyed every 3 months from March 2015 to December 2016. "
4056,1,"An in-person interview collected information on sociodemographics, GSN apps' use, recreational drug use, and sexual behaviors. "
4057,1,"In addition, blood was drawn to test for HIV and syphilis. "
4058,1,We used a multivariable Cox regression model to determine possible predictors for increased HIV incidence.
4059,2,"Of the enrolled 686 HIV-negative MSM, 431 (431/686, 62.8%) were GSN apps' users. "
4060,2,"Compared with GSN apps' nonusers, GSN apps' users were younger; had an earlier age of sexual debut; and in the past 3 months, were more likely to have used recreational drugs, more likely to have had 5 or more casual partners (CPs), more likely to have had group sex with males, and more likely to have had condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with male steady partners (SPs). "
4061,2,"In addition, 59.4% (256/431) of the GSN apps' users were willing to accept HIV and AIDS prevention information push services through GSN apps. "
4062,2,"In total, 19 MSM seroconverted to HIV during the follow-up period; the HIV incidence density rate was 8.5 (95% CI 5.0-13.5) per 100 person-years (PY) among GSN apps' users and 2.0 (95% CI 0.4-5.8) per 100 PY among nonusers. "
4063,2,"New HIV infections were independently associated with ever using GSN apps to seek male sexual partners (P=.04) and in the past 3 months, using recreational drugs (P=.048), having group sex with males (P=.01), and having CAI with male CPs (P=.02)."
4064,3,GSN apps' use is associated with higher HIV incidence and may be mediated through recreational drug use and having multiple CPs. 
4065,3,Researchers must develop an intervention propagated through GSN apps to reach this high-risk population to mitigate the HIV epidemic in the MSM community.
4066,4,Creating Engaging Health Promotion Campaigns on Social Media: Observations and Lessons From Fitbit and Garmin
4067,0,"The popularity and reach of social media make it an ideal delivery platform for interventions targeting health behaviors, such as physical inactivity. "
4068,0,"Research has identified a dose-response relationship whereby greater engagement and exposure are positively associated with intervention effects, hence enhancing engagement will maximize the potential of these interventions."
4069,1,"Posts (n=509) made by Fitbit and Garmin on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram over a 3-month period were coded for the presence of creative elements. "
4070,1,"User engagement regarding the total number of likes, comments, or shares per post was recorded. "
4071,1,Negative binomial regression analyses were used to identify creative elements associated with higher engagement.
4072,2,"Engagement on Instagram was 30-200 times higher than on Facebook, or Twitter. "
4073,2,Fitbit and Garmin tended to use different creative elements from one another. 
4074,2,"A higher engagement was achieved by posts featuring an image of the product, highlighting new product features and with themes of self-improvement (P<.01)."
4075,3,Findings suggest that Instagram may be a particularly promising platform for delivering engaging health messaging. 
4076,3,Health messages which incorporate inspirational imagery and focus on a tangible product appear to achieve the highest engagement. 
4077,3,"Fitbit and Garmin employed difference creative elements, which is likely to reflect differences in their target markets. "
4078,3,This underscores the importance of market segmentation in health messaging campaigns.
4079,4,Automated Identification of Hookahs (Waterpipes) on Instagram: An Application in Feature Extraction Using Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine Classification
4080,0,"Instagram, with millions of posts per day, can be used to inform public health surveillance targets and policies. "
4081,0,"However, current research relying on image-based data often relies on hand coding of images, which is time-consuming and costly, ultimately limiting the scope of the study. "
4082,0,"Current best practices in automated image classification (eg, support vector machine (SVM), backpropagation neural network, and artificial neural network) are limited in their capacity to accurately distinguish between objects within images."
4083,1,Images of waterpipes or hookah (an emerging tobacco product possessing similar harms to that of cigarettes) were collected from Instagram and used in the analyses (N=840). 
4084,1,A CNN was used to extract unique features from images identified to contain waterpipes. 
4085,1,An SVM classifier was built to distinguish between images with and without waterpipes. 
4086,1,Methods for image classification were then compared to show how a CNN+SVM classifier could improve accuracy.
4087,2,"As the number of validated training images increased, the total number of extracted features increased. "
4088,2,"In addition, as the number of features learned by the SVM classifier increased, the average level of accuracy increased. "
4089,2,"Overall, 99.5% (418/420) of images classified were correctly identified as either hookah or nonhookah images. "
4090,2,"This level of accuracy was an improvement over earlier methods that used SVM, CNN, or bag-of-features alone."
4091,3,"A CNN extracts more features of images, allowing an SVM classifier to be better informed, resulting in higher accuracy compared with methods that extract fewer features. "
4092,3,Future research can use this method to grow the scope of image-based studies. 
4093,3,The methods presented here might help detect increases in the popularity of certain tobacco products over time on social media. 
4094,3,"By taking images of waterpipes from Instagram, we place our methods in a context that can be utilized to inform health researchers analyzing social media to understand user experience with emerging tobacco products and inform public health surveillance targets and policies."
4095,4,Insights Into Older Adult Patient Concerns Around the Caregiver Proxy Portal Use: Qualitative Interview Study
4096,0,Electronic patient portals have become common and offer many potential benefits for patients' self-management of health care. 
4097,0,"These benefits could be especially important for older adult patients dealing with significant chronic illness, many of whom have caregivers, such as a spouse, adult child, or other family member or friend, who help with health care management. "
4098,0,"Patient portals commonly contain large amounts of personal information, including diagnoses, health histories, medications, specialist appointments, lab results, and billing and insurance information. "
4099,0,Some health care systems provide proxy accounts for caregivers to access a portal on behalf of a patient. 
4100,0,It is not well known how much and in what way caregivers are using patient portals on behalf of patients and whether patients see any information disclosure risks associated with such access.
4101,1,We conducted semistructured interviews with 10 older adult patients with chronic illness. 
4102,1,"We asked them about their relationship with their caregivers, their use of their patient portal, their caregiver's use of the portal, and their perceptions about the benefits and risks of their caregiver's use of the portals. "
4103,1,We also asked them about their comfort level with caregivers having access to information about a hypothetical diagnosis of a stigmatized condition. 
4104,1,Two investigators conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data.
4105,2,All patients identified caregivers. 
4106,2,"Some had given caregivers access to their portals, in all cases by sharing log-in credentials, rather than by setting up an official proxy account. "
4107,2,Patients generally saw benefits in their caregivers having access to the information and functions provided by the portal. 
4108,2,Patients generally reported that they would be uncomfortable with caregivers learning of stigmatized conditions and also with caregivers ( except spouses) accessing financial billing information.
4109,3,Patients share their electronic patient portal credentials with caregivers to receive the benefits of those caregivers having access to important medical information but are unaware of all the information those caregivers can access. 
4110,3,Better portal design could alleviate these unwanted information disclosures.
4111,4,A Practical Do-It-Yourself Recruitment Framework for Concurrent eHealth Clinical Trials: Simple Architecture (Part 1)
4112,0,"The ability to identify, screen, and enroll potential research participants in an efficient and timely manner is crucial to the success of clinical trials. "
4113,0,"In the age of the internet, researchers can be confronted with large numbers of people contacting the program, overwhelming study staff and frustrating potential participants."
4114,1,This work was conducted in an academic research center focused on developing and evaluating behavioral intervention technologies. 
4115,1,A needs assessment consisting of unstructured individual and group interviews was conducted to identify barriers to recruitment and important features for the new system.
4116,2,"We describe a practical and adaptable recruitment management architecture that used readily available software, such as REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) and standard statistical software (eg, SAS, R), to create an automated recruitment framework that supported prescreening potential participants, consent to join a research registry, triaging for management of multiple trials, capture of eligibility information for each phase of a recruitment pipeline, and staff management tools including monitoring of participant flow and task assignment/reassignment features. "
4117,2,The DIY-RSF was launched in July 2015. 
4118,2,"As of July 2017, the DIY-RSF has supported the successful recruitment efforts for eight trials, producing 14,557 participant records in the referral tracking database and 5337 participants in the center research registry. "
4119,2,The DIY-RSF has allowed for more efficient use of staff time and more rapid processing of potential applicants.
4120,3,"Using tools already supported at many academic institutions, we describe the architecture and utilization of an adaptable referral management framework to support recruitment for multiple concurrent clinical trials. "
4121,3,The DIY-RSF can serve as a guide for leveraging common technologies to improve clinical trial recruitment procedures.
4122,4,A Mobile Videoconference-Based Intervention on Stress Reduction and Resilience Enhancement in Employees: Randomized Controlled Trial
4123,0,Videoconferencing-based treatments have shown great potential in increasing engagement and compliance by decreasing the barriers of time and distance. 
4124,0,"In general, employees tend to experience a lot of stress, but find it difficult to visit a clinic during office hours."
4125,1,"In total, 81 participants were randomly allocated to one of the three conditions: mobile videoconferencing, in-person, and self-care; of these, 72 completed the study. "
4126,1,"All participants underwent assessment via self-reported questionnaires before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention. "
4127,1,"Intervention lasted for 4 weeks and consisted of elements of cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and meditation. "
4128,1,Changes in clinical variables regarding stress and resilience across time were compared between treatment conditions.
4129,2,"There were significant condition x time effects on variables measuring perceived stress, resilience, emotional labor, and sleep, demonstrating significantly differential effects across time according to treatment condition. "
4130,2,"Moreover, there were significant effects of condition on perceived stress and occupational stress. "
4131,2,There were no significant differences in any variable between the mobile videoconferencing and in-person conditions at 1 month after the intervention.
4132,3,Results indicate that both mobile videoconferencing and in-person interventions were comparably effective in decreasing stress and enhancing resilience. 
4133,3,Further studies with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up period are warranted to investigate the long-term effect of mobile videoconferencing interventions.
4134,4,Proposing a Transactional Model of eHealth Literacy: Concept Analysis
4135,0,"Electronic health (eHealth) literacy was conceptualized in 2006 as the ability of internet users to locate, evaluate, and act upon web-based health information. "
4136,0,"Now, advances in eHealth technology have cultivated transactional opportunities for patients to access, share, and monitor health information. "
4137,0,"However, empirical evidence shows that existing models and measures of eHealth literacy have limited theoretical underpinnings that reflect the transactional capabilities of eHealth. "
4138,0,"This paper describes a conceptual model based on the Transactional Model of Communication (TMC), in which eHealth literacy is described as an intrapersonal skillset hypothesized as being dynamic; reciprocal; and shaped by social, relational, and cultural contexts."
4139,1,"Walker and Avant's concept analysis method was used to guide the systematic review of eHealth literacy definitions (n=10), rating scales (n=6), models (n=4), and peer-reviewed model applications (n=16). "
4140,1,Subsequent cluster analyses showed salient themes across definitions. 
4141,1,"Dimensions, antecedents, and consequences reflected in models and measures were extracted and deductively analyzed based on codes consistent with the TMC."
4142,2,Systematic review evidence revealed incongruity between operational eHealth literacy included in definitions compared with literacies included within models and measures. 
4143,2,Theoretical underpinnings of eHealth literacy also remain dismal. 
4144,2,"Despite the transactional capabilities of eHealth, the role of ""communication"" in eHealth literacy remains underdeveloped and does not account for physical and cognitive processing abilities necessary for multiway transactions."
4145,3,The Transactional Model of eHealth Literacy and a corresponding definition are proposed. 
4146,3,"In this novel model, eHealth literacy comprises a hierarchical intrapersonal skillset that mediates the reciprocal effect of contextual factors (ie, user oriented and task oriented) on patient engagement in health care. "
4147,3,"More specifically, the intrapersonal skillset counteracts the negative effect of ""noise"" (or impediments) produced by social and relational contexts. "
4148,3,"Cutting across health and technology literacies, the intrapersonal skillset of eHealth literacy is operationalized through four literacies that correspond with discrete operative skills: (1) functional (ie, locate and understand); (2) communicative (ie, exchange); (3) critical (ie, evaluate); and (4) translational (ie, apply)."
4149,4,Effectiveness of Serious Gaming During the Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation of Patients With Complex Chronic Pain or Fatigue: Natural Quasi-Experiment
4150,0,"Current evidence for the effectiveness of specialist multidisciplinary programs for burdensome chronic pain and functional somatic syndromes drives the effort to improve approaches, strategies, and delivery modes. "
4151,0,It remains unknown to what extent and in what respect serious gaming during the regular outpatient rehabilitation can contribute to health outcomes.
4152,1,We conducted a naturalistic quasi-experiment using embedded qualitative methods. 
4153,1,The intervention group patients received an additional guided (mindfulness-based) serious gaming intervention during weeks 9-12 of a 16-week rehabilitation program at 2 sites of a Dutch rehabilitation clinic. 
4154,1,"Simultaneously, 119 control group patients followed the same program without serious gaming at 2 similar sites of the same clinic. "
4155,1,Data consisted of 10 semistructured patient interviews and routinely collected patient self-reported outcomes. 
4156,1,"First, multivariate linear mixed modeling was used to simultaneously estimate a group effect on the outcome change between weeks 8 and 16 in 4 primary outcomes: current pain intensity, fatigue, pain catastrophizing, and psychological distress. "
4157,1,"Second, similar univariate linear mixed models were used to estimate effects on particular (unstandardized) outcomes. "
4158,1,"Third, secondary outcomes (ie, global impression of change, general health, functioning, and treatment satisfaction) were compared between the groups using independent t tests. "
4159,1,"Finally, subgroups were established according to the levels of adherence using log data. "
4160,1,Influences of observed confounding factors were considered throughout analyses.
4161,2,"Of 329 eligible patients, 156 intervention group and 119 control group patients (N= 275) with mostly chronic back pain and concomitant psychosocial problems participated in this study. "
4162,2,"Of all, 119 patients played >= 75% of the game. "
4163,2,"First, the standardized means across the 4 primary outcomes showed a significantly more favorable degree of change during the second part of the treatment for the intervention group than for the control group (beta=-0.119, SE= 0.046, P=.009). "
4164,2,"Second, the intervention group showed a greater outcome change in depressive mood (b=-2.748, SE= 1.072, P=.011) but not in ""insufficiency"" or concentration problems. "
4165,2,"Third, no significant group effects on secondary outcomes were found. "
4166,2,"Fourth, adherence was generally high and invariant."
4167,3,The findings of this study suggest a very small favorable average effect on relevant health outcomes of additional serious gaming during multidisciplinary rehabilitation. 
4168,3,"The indication that serious gaming could be a relatively time-efficient component warrants further research into if, when, how, and for which patients serious gaming could be cost-effective in treatment and why."
4169,4,"Privacy, Trust, and Data Sharing in Web-Based and Mobile Research: Participant Perspectives in a Large Nationwide Sample of Men Who Have Sex With Men in the United States"
4170,0,"Modern research is heavily reliant on online and mobile technologies, which is particularly true among historically hard-to-reach populations such as gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). "
4171,0,"Despite this, very little empirical research has been published on participant perspectives about issues such as privacy, trust, and data sharing."
4172,1,Participants were recruited via a social networking site or sexual networking app to complete an anonymous online survey. 
4173,1,"We conducted a series of repeated measures analyses adjusted for between-person factors to examine within-person differences in the following: (1) trust for guarding personal information across different venues (eg, online research conducted by a university vs. "
4174,1,"an online search engine); (2) privacy concerns about 12 different types of data for three distinct data activities (ie, collection by app owners, anonymous selling to third parties, and anonymous sharing with researchers); and (3) willingness to share those 12 different types of data with researchers. "
4175,1,"Due to the large sample size, we primarily reported measures of effect size as evidence of clinical significance."
4176,2,"Online research was rated as most trusted and was more trusted than online and mobile technology companies, such as app owners and search engines, by magnitudes of effect that were moderate-to-large (eta(2)(partial)=0.06-0.11). "
4177,2,"Responding about 12 different types of data, participants expressed more concerns about data being anonymously sold to third-party partners (mean 7.6, median 10.0) and fewer concerns about data being collected by the app owners (mean 5.8, median 5.0) or shared anonymously with researchers (mean 4.6, median 3.0); differences were small-to-moderate in size (eta(2)(partial)=0.01-0.03). "
4178,2,"Furthermore, participants were most willing to share their public profile information (eg, age) with researchers but least willing to share device usage information (eg, other apps installed); the comparisons were small-to-moderate in size (eta(2)(partial)=0.03)."
4179,3,"Participants reported high levels of trust in online and mobile research, which is noteworthy given recent high-profile cases of corporate and government data security breaches and privacy violations. "
4180,3,Researchers and ethical boards should keep up with technological shifts to maintain the ability to guard privacy and confidentiality and maintain trust. 
4181,3,"There was substantial variability in privacy concerns about and willingness to share different types of data, suggesting the need to gain consent for data sharing on a specific rather than broad basis. "
4182,3,"Finally, we saw evidence of a privacy paradox, whereby participants expressed privacy concerns about the very types of data-related activities they have likely already permitted through the terms of the apps and sites they use regularly."
4183,4,Computer-Based Driving in Dementia Decision Tool With Mail Support: Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial
4184,0,Physicians often find significant challenges in assessing automobile driving in persons with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia and deciding when to report to transportation administrators. 
4185,0,Care must be taken to balance the safety of patients and other road users with potential negative effects of issuing such reports.
4186,1,The study used a parallel-group cluster nonblinded randomized controlled trial design to test a multifaceted knowledge translation intervention. 
4187,1,"The intervention included a computer-based decision support system activated by the physician-user, which provides a recommendation about whether to report patients with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment to transportation administrators, based on an algorithm derived from earlier work. "
4188,1,The intervention also included a mailed educational package and Web-based specialized reporting forms. 
4189,1,"Specialists and family physicians with expertise in dementia or care of the elderly were stratified by sex and randomized to either use the DD-DT or a control version of the tool that required identical data input as the intervention group, but instead generated a generic reminder about the reporting legislation in Ontario, Canada. "
4190,1,"The trial ran from September 9, 2014 to January 29, 2016, and the primary outcome was the number of reports made to the transportation administrators concordant with the algorithm."
4191,2,"A total of 69 participating physicians were randomized, and 36 of these used the DD-DT; 20 of the 35 randomized to the intervention group used DD-DT with 114 patients, and 16 of the 34 randomized to the control group used it with 103 patients. "
4192,2,"The proportion of all assessed patients reported to the transportation administrators concordant with recommendation did not differ between the intervention and the control groups (50% vs 49%; Z=-0.19, P=.85). "
4193,2,"Two variables predicted algorithm-based reporting-caregiver concern (odds ratio [OR]=5.8, 95% CI 2.5-13.6, P<.001) and abnormal clock drawing (OR 6.1, 95% CI 3.1-11.8, P<.001)."
4194,3,"On the basis of this quantitative analysis, in- office abnormal clock drawing and expressions of concern about driving from caregivers substantially influenced physicians to report patients with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment to transportation administrators, but the DD-DT tool itself did not increase such reports among these expert physicians."
4195,4,The Association Between Technology Use and Health Status in a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Cohort: Multi-Method Study
4196,0,Telemedicine and electronic health (eHealth) interventions have been proposed to improve management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for patients between traditional clinic and hospital visits to reduce complications. 
4197,0,"However, the effectiveness of such interventions may depend on patients' comfort with technology."
4198,1,We administered a structured survey about the use of communication technologies to a cohort of persons in the COPDGene study at one midwestern hospital in the United States. 
4199,1,Survey results were combined with clinical and demographic data previously collected as part of the cohort study. 
4200,1,A subsample of patients also completed eHealth simulation tasks. 
4201,1,We used logistic or linear regression to determine the relationship between patient demographics and COPD disease severity and reported use of communication-related technology and the results from our simulated eHealth-related tasks.
4202,2,A total of 686 patients completed the survey and 100 participated in the eHealth simulation. 
4203,2,"Overall, those who reported using communication technology were younger (P=.005) and had higher incomes (P=.03). "
4204,2,Men appeared less likely to engage in text messaging (P<.001) than women. 
4205,2,Patients who spent more time on tasks in the eHealth simulation had greater odds of a COPD Assessment Test score >10 (P=.02) and walked shorter distances in their 6-minute walk tests (P=.003) than those who took less time.
4206,3,"Older patients, patients with lower incomes, and less healthy patients were less likely to report using communication technology, and they did not perform as well on our simulated eHealth tasks. "
4207,3,"Thus, eHealth-based interventions may not be as effective in these populations, and additional training in communication technology may be needed."
4208,4,Detecting Motor Impairment in Early Parkinsons Disease via Natural Typing Interaction With Keyboards: Validation of the neuroQWERTY Approach in an Uncontrolled At-Home Setting
4209,0,Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and one of the most common forms of movement disorder. 
4210,0,"Although there is no known cure for PD, existing therapies can provide effective symptomatic relief. "
4211,0,"However, optimal titration is crucial to avoid adverse effects. "
4212,0,"Today, decision making for PD management is challenging because it relies on subjective clinical evaluations that require a visit to the clinic. "
4213,0,This challenge has motivated recent research initiatives to develop tools that can be used by nonspecialists to assess psychomotor impairment. 
4214,0,"Among these emerging solutions, we recently reported the neuroQWERTY index, a new digital marker able to detect motor impairment in an early PD cohort through the analysis of the key press and release timing data collected during a controlled in-clinic typing task."
4215,1,We implemented the data-collection platform and software to enable access and storage of the typing data generated by users while using their computer at home. 
4216,1,We recruited a total of 60 participants; of these participants 52 (25 people with Parkinson's and 27 healthy controls) provided enough data to complete the analysis. 
4217,1,"Finally, to evaluate whether our in-clinic-built algorithm could be used in an uncontrolled at-home setting, we compared its performance on the data collected during the controlled typing task in the clinic and the results of our method using the data passively collected at home."
4218,2,"Despite the randomness and sparsity introduced by the uncontrolled setting, our algorithm performed nearly as well in the at-home data (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] of 0.76 and sensitivity/specificity of 0.73/0.69) as it did when used to evaluate the in-clinic data (AUC 0.83 and sensitivity/specificity of 0.77/0.72). "
4219,2,"Moreover, the keystroke metrics presented a strong correlation between the 2 typing settings, which suggests a minimal influence of the in-clinic typing task in users' normal typing."
4220,3,The finding that an algorithm trained on data from an in-clinic setting has comparable performance with that tested on data collected through naturalistic at-home computer use reinforces the hypothesis that subtle differences in motor function can be detected from typing behavior. 
4221,3,"This work represents another step toward an objective, user-convenient, and quasi-continuous monitoring tool for PD."
4222,4,"Treatment Activity, User Satisfaction, and Experienced Usability of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adults With Depression and Anxiety After a Myocardial Infarction: Mixed-Methods Study"
4223,0,Knowledge about user experiences may lead to insights about how to improve treatment activity in Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety among people with a somatic disease. 
4224,0,"There is a need for studies conducted alongside randomized trials, to explore treatment activity and user experiences related to such interventions, especially among people with older age who are recruited in routine care."
4225,1,This was a mixed methods study where quantitative and qualitative approaches were used. 
4226,1,Patients were recruited consecutively from 25 cardiac clinics in Sweden. 
4227,1,The study included 117 patients allocated to 14 weeks of an iCBT intervention in the U-CARE Heart study. 
4228,1,"Quantitative data about treatment activity and therapist communication were collected through logged user patterns, which were analyzed with descriptive statistics. "
4229,1,"Qualitative data with regard to positive and negative experiences, and suggestions for improvements concerning the intervention, were collected through semistructured interviews with 21 patients in the treatment arm after follow-up. "
4230,1,The interviews were analyzed with qualitative manifest content analysis.
4231,2,"Treatment activity was low with regard to number of completed modules (mean 0.76, SD 0.93, range 0-5) and completed assignments (mean 3.09, SD 4.05, range 0-29). "
4232,2,"Most of the participants initiated the introduction module (113/117, 96.6%), and about half (63/117, 53.9%) of all participants completed the introductory module, but only 18 (15.4%, 18/117) continued to work with any of the remaining 10 modules, and each of the remaining modules was completed by 7 or less of the participants. "
4233,2,"On average, patients sent less than 2 internal messages to their therapist during the intervention (mean 1.42, SD 2.56, range 0-16). "
4234,2,"Interviews revealed different preferences with regard to the internet-based portal, the content of the treatment program, and the therapist communication. "
4235,2,"Aspects related to the personal situation and required skills included unpleasant emotions evoked by the intervention, lack of time, and technical difficulties."
4236,3,"Patients with a recent myocardial infarction and symptoms of depression and anxiety showed low treatment activity in this guided iCBT intervention with regard to completed modules, completed assignments, and internal messages sent to their therapist. "
4237,3,"The findings call attention to the need for researchers to carefully consider the preferences, personal situation, and technical skills of the end users during the development of these interventions. "
4238,3,"The study indicates several challenges that need to be addressed to improve treatment activity, user satisfaction, and usability in internet-based interventions in this population."
4239,4,Prediction of Incident Hypertension Within the Next Year: Prospective Study Using Statewide Electronic Health Records and Machine Learning
4240,0,"As a high-prevalence health condition, hypertension is clinically costly, difficult to manage, and often leads to severe and life-threatening diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke."
4241,1,Data from individual patient electronic health records (EHRs) were extracted from the Maine Health Information Exchange network. 
4242,1,"Retrospective (N=823,627, calendar year 2013) and prospective (N=680,810, calendar year 2014) cohorts were formed. "
4243,1,"A machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, was adopted in the process of feature selection and model building. "
4244,1,It generated an ensemble of classification trees and assigned a final predictive risk score to each individual.
4245,2,"The 1-year incident hypertension risk model attained areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.917 and 0.870 in the retrospective and prospective cohorts, respectively. "
4246,2,"Risk scores were calculated and stratified into five risk categories, with 4526 out of 381,544 patients (1.19%) in the lowest risk category (score 0-0.05) and 21,050 out of 41,329 patients (50.93%) in the highest risk category (score 0.4-1) receiving a diagnosis of incident hypertension in the following 1 year. "
4247,2,"Type 2 diabetes, lipid disorders, CVDs, mental illness, clinical utilization indicators, and socioeconomic determinants were recognized as driving or associated features of incident essential hypertension. "
4248,2,"The very high risk population mainly comprised elderly (age>50 years) individuals with multiple chronic conditions, especially those receiving medications for mental disorders. "
4249,2,"Disparities were also found in social determinants, including some community-level factors associated with higher risk and others that were protective against hypertension."
4250,3,"With statewide EHR datasets, our study prospectively validated an accurate 1-year risk prediction model for incident essential hypertension. "
4251,3,"Our real-time predictive analytic model has been deployed in the state of Maine, providing implications in interventions for hypertension and related diseases and hopefully enhancing hypertension care."
4252,4,Automatic Classification of Users Health Information Need Context: Logistic Regression Analysis of Mouse-Click and Eye-Tracker Data
4253,0,"Users searching for health information on the Internet may be searching for their own health issue, searching for someone else's health issue, or browsing with no particular health issue in mind. "
4254,0,Previous research has found that these three categories of users focus on different types of health information. 
4255,0,"However, most health information websites provide static content for all users. "
4256,0,"If the three types of user health information need contexts can be identified by the Web application, the search results or information offered to the user can be customized to increase its relevance or usefulness to the user."
4257,1,"A total of 74 participants (39 females and 35 males) who were mainly staff and students of a university were asked to browse a health discussion forum, Healthboards. "
4258,1,com. 
4259,1,"An eye tracker recorded their examining (eye fixation) and skimming (quick eye movement) behaviors on 2 types of screens: summary result screen displaying a list of post headers, and detailed post screen. "
4260,1,"The following three types of predictive models were developed using logistic regression analysis: model 1 used only the time spent in scanning the summary result screen and reading the detailed post screen, which can be determined from the user's mouse clicks; model 2 used the examining and skimming durations on each screen, recorded by an eye tracker; and model 3 added user demographic and urgency information to model 2."
4261,2,An analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis found that users' browsing durations were significantly different for the three health information contexts (P<.001). 
4262,2,"The logistic regression model 3 was able to predict the user's type of health information context with a 10-fold cross validation mean accuracy of 84% (62/74), followed by model 2 at 73% (54/74) and model 1 at 71% (52/78). "
4263,2,"In addition, correlation analysis found that particular browsing durations were highly correlated with users' age, education level, and the urgency of their information need."
4264,3,"A user's type of health information need context (ie, searching for self, for others, or with no health issue in mind) can be identified with reasonable accuracy using just user mouse clicks that can easily be detected by Web applications. "
4265,3,Higher accuracy can be obtained using Google glass or future computing devices with eye tracking function.
4266,4,Impact of an Electronic Health Record-Integrated Personal Health Record on Patient Participation in Health Care: Development and Randomized Controlled Trial of MyHealthKeeper
4267,0,Personal health record (PHR)-based health care management systems can improve patient engagement and data-driven medical diagnosis in a clinical setting.
4268,1,"To improve the conventional EHR-tethered PHR, we ascertained clinicians' unmet needs regarding PHR functionality and the data frequently used in the field through a cocreation workshop. "
4269,1,We incorporated the requirements into the system design and architecture of the MyHealthKeeper PHR module. 
4270,1,We constructed the app and validated the effectiveness of the PHR module by conducting a 4-week clinical trial. 
4271,1,"We used a commercially available activity tracker (Misfit) to collect individual physical activity data, and developed the MyHealthKeeper mobile phone app to record participants' patterns of daily food intake and activity logs. "
4272,1,We randomly assigned 80 participants to either the PHR-based intervention group (n=51) or the control group (n=29). 
4273,1,"All of the study participants completed a paper-based survey, a laboratory test, a physical examination, and an opinion interview. "
4274,1,"During the 4-week study period, we collected health-related mobile data, and study participants visited the outpatient clinic twice and received PHR-based clinical diagnosis and recommendations."
4275,2,A total of 68 participants (44 in the intervention group and 24 in the control group) completed the study. 
4276,2,"The PHR intervention group showed significantly higher weight loss than the control group (mean 1.4 kg, 95% CI 0.9-1.9; P<.001) at the final week (week 4). "
4277,2,"In addition, triglyceride levels were significantly lower by the end of the study period (mean 2.59 mmol/L, 95% CI 17.6-75.8; P=.002)."
4278,3,We developed an innovative EHR-tethered PHR system that allowed clinicians and patients to share lifelog data. 
4279,3,This study shows the effectiveness of a patient-managed and clinician-guided health tracker system and its potential to improve patient clinical profiles.
4280,4,Reporting of Telehealth-Delivered Dietary Intervention Trials in Chronic Disease: Systematic Review
4281,0,Telehealth-delivered dietary interventions are effective for chronic disease management and are an emerging area of clinical practice. 
4282,0,"However, to apply interventions from the research setting in clinical practice, health professionals need details of each intervention component."
4283,1,Eligible randomized controlled trial publications were identified through a systematic review. 
4284,1,"The completeness of reporting of experimental and comparison interventions was assessed by two independent assessors using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist that consists of 12 items including intervention rationale, materials used, procedures, providers, delivery mode, location, when and how much intervention delivered, intervention tailoring, intervention modifications, and fidelity. "
4285,1,"Where reporting was incomplete, further information was sought from additional published material and through email correspondence with trial authors."
4286,2,"Within the 37 eligible trials, there were 49 experimental interventions and 37 comparison interventions. "
4287,2,One trial reported every TIDieR item for their experimental intervention. 
4288,2,No publications reported every item for the comparison intervention. 
4289,2,"For the experimental interventions, the most commonly reported items were location (96%), mode of delivery (98%), and rationale for the essential intervention elements (96%). "
4290,2,Least reported items for experimental interventions were modifications (2%) and intervention material descriptions (39%) and where to access them (20%). 
4291,2,"Of the 37 authors, 14 responded with further information, and 8 could not be contacted."
4292,3,Many details of the experimental and comparison interventions in telehealth-delivered dietary chronic disease management trials are incompletely reported. 
4293,3,This prevents accurate interpretation of trial results and implementation of effective interventions in clinical practice.
4294,4,The Promise and Pitfalls of Using Crowdsourcing in Research Prioritization for Back Pain: Cross-Sectional Surveys
4295,0,The involvement of patients in research better aligns evidence generation to the gaps that patients themselves face when making decisions about health care. 
4296,0,"However, obtaining patients' perspectives is challenging. "
4297,0,"Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has gained popularity over the past decade as a crowdsourcing platform to reach large numbers of individuals to perform tasks for a small reward for the respondent, at small cost to the investigator. "
4298,0,The appropriateness of such crowdsourcing methods in medical research has yet to be clarified.
4299,1,We conducted cross-sectional surveys on MTurk to assess participants' back pain and allow them to prioritize research topics. 
4300,1,"We paid respondents US $0.10 to complete the 24-point Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) to categorize participants as those ""with back pain"" and those ""without back pain,"" then offered both those with (RMDQ score >= 7) and those without back pain (RMDQ <7) an opportunity to rank their top 5 (of 18) research topics for an additional US $0.75. "
4301,1,We compared demographic information and research priorities between the 2 groups and performed qualitative analyses on free-text commentary that participants provided.
4302,2,We conducted 2 screening waves. 
4303,2,"We first screened 2189 individuals for back pain over 33 days and invited 480 (21.93%) who screened positive to complete the prioritization, of whom 350 (72.9% of eligible) did. "
4304,2,"We later screened 664 individuals over 7 days and invited 474 (71.4%) without back pain to complete the prioritization, of whom 397 (83.7% of eligible) did. "
4305,2,"Those with back pain who prioritized were comparable with those without in terms of age, education, marital status, and employment. "
4306,2,"The group with back pain had a higher proportion of women (234, 67.2% vs 229, 57.8%, P=.02). "
4307,2,The groups' rank lists of research priorities were highly correlated: Spearman correlation coefficient was .88 when considering topics ranked in the top 5. 
4308,2,The 2 groups agreed on 4 of the top 5 and 9 of the top 10 research priorities.
4309,3,Crowdsourcing platforms such as MTurk support efforts to efficiently reach large groups of individuals to obtain input on research activities. 
4310,3,"In the context of back pain, a prevalent and easily understood condition, the rank list of those with back pain was highly correlated with that of those without back pain. "
4311,3,"However, subtle differences in the content and quality of free-text comments suggest supplemental efforts may be needed to augment the reach of crowdsourcing in obtaining perspectives from patients, especially from specific populations."
4312,4,Video Game Intervention for Sexual Risk Reduction in Minority Adolescents: Randomized Controlled Trial
4313,0,Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disproportionately impacts minority youth. 
4314,0,Interventions to decrease HIV sexual risk are needed.
4315,1,"Participants aged 11 to 14 years from 12 community afterschool, school, and summer programs were randomized 1: 1 to play up to 16 hours of an experimental video game or control video games over 6 weeks. "
4316,1,"Assessments were conducted at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, and 12 months. "
4317,1,Primary outcome was delay of initiation of vaginal/anal intercourse. 
4318,1,"Secondary outcomes included sexual health attitudes, knowledge, and intentions. "
4319,1,We examined outcomes by gender and age.
4320,2,"A total of 333 participants were randomized to play the intervention (n=166) or control games (n=167): 295 (88.6%) were racial/ethnic minorities, 177 (53.2%) were boys, and the mean age was 12.9 (1.1) years. "
4321,2,"At 12 months, for the 258 (84.6%) participants with available data, 94.6% (122/129) in the intervention group versus 95.4% (123/129) in the control group delayed initiation of intercourse (relative risk=0.99, 95% CI 0.94-1.05, P=.77). "
4322,2,"Over 12 months, the intervention group demonstrated improved sexual health attitudes overall compared to the control group (least squares means [LS means] difference 0.37, 95% CI 0.01-0.72, P=.04). "
4323,2,"This improvement was observed in boys (LS means difference 0.67, P=.008), but not girls (LS means difference 0.06, P=.81), and in younger (LS means difference 0.71, P=.005), but not older participants (LS means difference 0.03, P=.92). "
4324,2,"The intervention group also demonstrated increased sexual health knowledge overall (LS means difference 1.13, 95% CI 0.64-1.61, P<.001), in girls (LS means difference 1.16, P=.001), boys (LS means difference 1.10, P=.001), younger (LS means difference 1.18, P=.001), and older (LS means difference=1.08, P=.002) participants. "
4325,2,"There were no differences in intentions to delay the initiation of intercourse between the two groups (LS means difference 0.10, P=.56)."
4326,3,An interactive video game intervention improves sexual health attitudes and knowledge in minority adolescents for at least 12 months.
4327,4,Effectiveness of Telemonitoring in Obstetrics: Scoping Review
4328,0,"Despite reported positive results of telemonitoring effectiveness in various health care domains, this new technology is rarely used in prenatal care. "
4329,0,A few isolated investigations were performed in the past years but with conflicting results.
4330,1,This review includes studies exploring the effectiveness of telemonitoring interventions for pregnant women reported in the English language. 
4331,1,"Due to the paucity of research in this area, all reports including uncontrolled nonrandomized and randomized controlled studies were selected."
4332,2,"Fourteen studies, which performed their data collection from 1988 to 2010, met the inclusion criteria and were published from 1995 to present; four of the 14 published papers were multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs), five papers were single-center RCTs, three papers were retrospective studies, one paper was an observational study, and one paper was a qualitative study. "
4333,2,"Of the 14 papers, nine were available for a risk of bias assessment: three papers were classified as low risk, one as medium risk, and five as high risk. "
4334,2,"Furthermore, of those 14 papers, 13 focused on telemonitoring for maternal outcomes, and nine of the 14 papers focused on telemonitoring for fetal or neonatal outcomes. "
4335,2,"The studies reviewed report that telemonitoring can contribute to significant reductions in health care costs, (unscheduled) face-to-face visits, low neonatal birth weight, and admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), as well as prolonged gestational age and improved feelings of maternal satisfaction when compared with a control group. "
4336,2,"When only studies with low risk of bias were taken into account, the added value of telemonitoring became less pronounced: the only added value of telemonitoring is for pregnant women who transmitted their uterine activity by telecommunication. "
4337,2,"They had significant prolonged pregnancy survivals, and the newborns were less likely to be of low birth weight or to be admitted to the NICU. "
4338,2,"Following these results, telemonitoring can only be recommended by pregnant women at risk for preterm delivery. "
4339,2,"It is however important to consider that these studies were published in the mid-90s, which limits their direct applicability given the current technologies and practice."
4340,3,This review shows that telemonitoring can be tentatively recommended for pregnant women at risk for preterm delivery. 
4341,3,More recent RCTs with a blinded protocol are needed to strengthen the level of evidence around this topic and to have an insight in the added value of the technologies that are available nowadays. 
4342,3,"In addition, studies investigating patient satisfaction and economic effects in relation to telemonitoring are suggested for future research."
4343,4,Cardiac Patients Experiences and Perceptions of Social Media: Mixed-Methods Study
4344,0,"Traditional in-person cardiac rehabilitation has substantial benefits for cardiac patients, which are offset by poor attendance. "
4345,0,The rapid increase in social media use in older adults provides an opportunity to reach patients who are eligible for cardiac rehabilitation but unable to attend traditional face-to-face groups. 
4346,0,"However, there is a paucity of research on cardiac patients' experiences and perspectives on using social media to support their health."
4347,1,A mixed-methods study was undertaken among cardiac rehabilitation patients in both urban and rural areas. 
4348,1,"First, this study included a survey (n=284) on social media use and capability. "
4349,1,"Second, six focus group interviews were conducted with current Facebook users (n=18) to elucidate Facebook experience and perspectives."
4350,2,"Social media use was low (28.0%, 79/282) but more common in participants who were under 70 years of age, employed, and had completed high school. "
4351,2,"Social media users accessed Web-based information on general health issues (65%, 51/79), medications (56%, 44/79), and heart health (43%, 34/79). "
4352,2,"Participants were motivated to invest time in using Facebook for ""keeping in touch"" with family and friends and to be informed by expert cardiac health professionals and fellow cardiac participants if given the opportunity. "
4353,2,"It appeared that participants who had a higher level of Facebook capability (understanding of features and the consequences of their use and efficiency in use) spent more time on Facebook and reported higher levels of ""liking,"" commenting, or sharing posts. "
4354,2,"Furthermore, higher Facebook capability appeared to increase a participants' willingness to participate in a cardiac Facebook support group. "
4355,2,More capable users were more receptive to the use of Facebook for cardiac rehabilitation and more likely to express interest in providing peer support. 
4356,2,"Recommended features for a cardiac rehabilitation Facebook group included a closed group, expert cardiac professional involvement, provision of cardiac health information, and ensuring trustworthiness of the group."
4357,3,"Cardiac health professionals have an opportunity to capitalize on cardiac patients' motivations and social media, mostly Facebook, as well as the capability for supporting cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention. "
4358,3,Participants' favored purposeful time spent on Facebook and their cardiac health provides such a purpose for a Facebook intervention. 
4359,3,The study results will inform the development of a Facebook intervention for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
4360,1,The participants self-reported their PA using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and wore an accelerometer while completing daily EMAs (delivered through the mobile phone) for 7 days. 
4361,1,"Weekly summary estimates included sedentary time and moderate-, vigorous-, and moderate- to vigorous- intensity physical activity (MVPA). "
4362,1,Spearman coefficients and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients (LCC) examined the linear association and agreement for EMA and the questionnaires as compared with accelerometry.
4363,2,"Participants were aged 43.3 (SD 13.1) years, 51.7% (123/238) were African American, 74.8% (178/238) were overweight or obese, and 63.0% (150/238) were low income. "
4364,2,"The linear associations of EMA and traditional self-reports with accelerometer estimates were statistically significant (P<.05) for sedentary time (EMA: rho=.16), moderate- intensity PA (EMA: rho=.29; BRFSS: rho=.17; IPAQ: rho=.24), and MVPA (EMA: rho=.31; BRFSS: rho=.17; IPAQ: rho=.20). "
4365,2,Only EMA estimates of PA were statistically significant compared with accelerometer for agreement.
4366,3,The mobile EMA showed better correlation and agreement to accelerometer estimates than traditional self-report methods. 
4367,3,These findings suggest that mobile EMA may be a practical alternative to accelerometers to assess PA in free-living settings.
4368,4,The Reviews Are in: A Qualitative Content Analysis of Consumer Perspectives on Apps for Bipolar Disorder
4369,0,The delivery of mobile health (mHealth) services is acceptable to mental health consumers. 
4370,0,"However, despite the benefits of accessibility, cost-effectiveness, anonymity, and ability to tailor content to individual needs, consumer engagement remains a hurdle for uptake and continued use. "
4371,0,This may be unsurprising as few studies have examined app content from the consumer perspective or assessed consumer preferences for the content of apps for mental health management. 
4372,0,An opportunity to examine consumer perspectives exists in using naturally generated data that is publically available in the Google Play and Apple app stores. 
4373,0,"Whereas commercial developers routinely use this data, to date there has been no in-depth evaluation within scientific research."
4374,1,"Publically available English language consumer reviews of 48 apps for bipolar disorder were used as data, providing a total of 2173 reviews. "
4375,1,Review text was coded and analyzed using a team approach to qualitative content analysis. 
4376,1,Results were presented in 2 forms: (1) a quantitative summary of the 9 major and minor themes and (2) a qualitative synthesis of key thematic findings.
4377,2,"The majority of reviews were for symptom monitoring apps (87.94%, 1911/2173). "
4378,2,"The qualitative content analysis revealed 5 main themes: (1) laudatory talk, comments regarding the app's benefits including helpfulness and successful design features (74.00% of reviews, 1608/2173); (2) unfavorable feedback, negative reviews largely concerning unmet needs, privacy and technical issues, and potential dangers of app use (25.54%, 555/2173); (3) conceptions of community, referring to both communities of users with mental ill-health accessed via the app and a community created among app users and developers (24.25%, 527/2173); (4) wishlist features, app features requested by users (17.53%, 381/2173); and (5) apps and therapy, app use within clinical care (10.58%, 230/2173). "
4379,2,"Four minor themes were also identified: (1) app cost, (2) privacy and data security, (3) comparisons with traditional monitoring, and (4) evidence-based mHealth."
4380,3,"Although mostly positive, the proportion of reviews containing wishlist requests indicates consumer needs are not adequately addressed by currently available disorder management apps. "
4381,3,"Consumers value content that is helpful, supportive, and easy to use, and they are integrating apps into their health management and clinical care without necessarily considering the evidence-base or clinical effectiveness of the tool. "
4382,3,User expectations regarding developer responsiveness to their needs has implications for community-based participatory research and integrated knowledge translation. 
4383,3,"However, this expectation is incompatible with current mHealth funding structures."
4384,4,Use of Videos Improves Informed Consent Comprehension in Web-Based Surveys Among Internet-Using Men Who Have Sex With Men: A Randomized Controlled Trial
4385,0,Web-based surveys are increasingly used to capture data essential for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention research. 
4386,0,"However, there are challenges in ensuring the informed consent of Web-based research participants."
4387,1,"From July to September 2014, paid advertisements on Facebook were used to recruit adult MSM living in the United States for a Web-based survey about risk and preventive behaviors. "
4388,1,"Participants were randomized to one of the 4 methods of delivering informed consent: a professionally produced video, a study staff-produced video, a frequently asked questions (FAQs) text page, and a standard informed consent text page. "
4389,1,"Following the behavior survey, participants answered 15 questions about comprehension of consent information. "
4390,1,"Correct responses to each question were given a score of 1, for a total possible scale score of 15. "
4391,1,General linear regression and post-hoc Tukey comparisons were used to assess difference (P <.001) in mean consent comprehension scores. 
4392,1,A mediation analysis was used to examine the relationship between time spent on consent page and consent comprehension.
4393,2,"Of the 665 MSM participants who completed the comprehension questions, 24.2% (161/665) received the standard consent, 27.1% (180/665) received the FAQ consent, 26.8% (178/665) received the professional consent video, and 22.0% (146/665) received the staff video. "
4394,2,The overall average consent comprehension score was 6.28 (SD=2.89). 
4395,2,"The average consent comprehension score differed significantly across consent type (P <.001), age (P=.04), race or ethnicity (P <.001), and highest level of education (P=.001). "
4396,2,"Compared with those who received the standard consent, comprehension was significantly higher for participants who received the professional video consent (score increase=1.79; 95% CI 1.02-2.55) and participants who received the staff video consent (score increase=1.79; 95% CI 0.99-2.59). "
4397,2,There was no significant difference in comprehension for those who received the FAQ consent. 
4398,2,Participants spent more time on the 2 video consents (staff video median time=117 seconds; professional video median time=115 seconds) than the FAQ (median=21 seconds) and standard consents (median=37 seconds). 
4399,2,"Mediation analysis showed that though time spent on the consent page was partially responsible for some of the differences in comprehension, the direct effects of the professional video (score increase=0.93; 95% CI 0.39-1.48) and the staff-produced video (score increase=0.99; 95% CI 0.42-1.56) were still significant."
4400,3,Video-based consent methods improve consent comprehension of MSM participating in a Web-based HIV behavioral survey. 
4401,3,"This effect may be partially mediated through increased time spent reviewing the consent material; however, the video consent may still be superior to standard consent in improving participant comprehension of key study facts."
4402,4,Increasing Consumer Engagement by Tailoring a Public Reporting Website on the Quality of Diabetes Care: A Qualitative Study
4403,0,The majority of health care utilization decisions in the United States are made by persons with multiple chronic conditions. 
4404,0,Existing public reports of health system quality do not distinguish care for these persons and are often not used by the consumers they aim to reach.
4405,1,We adapted an existing consumer-focused public reporting website using adult learning theory to display diabetes quality reports tailored to the user's chronic condition profile. 
4406,1,We conducted in-depth cognitive interviews with 20 individuals who either had diabetes and/or cared for someone with diabetes to assess the website. 
4407,1,"Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed, then analyzed using thematic content analysis."
4408,2,"Three themes emerged that suggested increased engagement from tailoring the site to a user's chronic conditions: ability to interact, relevance, and feeling empowered to act."
4409,3,"We conclude that tailoring can be used to improve public reporting sites for individuals with chronic conditions, ultimately allowing consumers to make more informed health care decisions."
4410,4,Telemedicine Technologies for Diabetes in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
4411,0,Diabetes in pregnancy is a global problem. 
4412,0,Technological innovations present exciting opportunities for novel approaches to improve clinical care delivery for gestational and other forms of diabetes in pregnancy.
4413,1,The review was developed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. 
4414,1,Randomized controlled trials (RCT) in women with diabetes in pregnancy that compared telemedicine blood glucose monitoring with the standard care were identified. 
4415,1,"Searches were performed in SCOPUS and PubMed, limited to English language publications between January 2000 and January 2016. "
4416,1,Trials that met the eligibility criteria were scored for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaborations Risk of Bias Tool. 
4417,1,"A meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager software version 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration)."
4418,2,A total of 7 trials were identified. 
4419,2,Meta-analysis demonstrated a modest but statistically significant improvement in HbA1c associated with the use of a telemedicine technology. 
4420,2,"The mean HbA1c of women using telemedicine was 5.33% (SD 0.70) compared with 5.45% (SD 0.58) in the standard care group, representing a mean difference of -0.12% (95% CI -0.23% to -0.02%). "
4421,2,"When this comparison was limited to women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) only, the mean HbA1c of women using telemedicine was 5.22% (SD 0.70) compared with 5.37% (SD 0.61) in the standard care group, mean difference -0.14% (95% CI -0.25% to -0.04%). "
4422,2,There were no differences in other maternal and neonatal outcomes reported.
4423,3,"There is currently insufficient evidence that telemedicine technology is superior to standard care for women with diabetes in pregnancy; however, there was no evidence of harm. "
4424,3,"No trials were identified that assessed patient satisfaction or cost of care delivery, and it may be in these areas where these technologies may be found most valuable."
4425,4,Role of Psychosocial Factors and Health Literacy in Pregnant Womens Intention to Use a Decision Aid for Down Syndrome Screening: A Theory-Based Web Survey
4426,0,"Deciding about undergoing prenatal screening is difficult, as it entails risks, potential loss and regrets, and challenges to personal values. "
4427,0,"Shared decision making and decision aids (DAs) can help pregnant women give informed and values-based consent or refusal to prenatal screening, but little is known about factors influencing the use of DAs."
4428,1,We conducted a survey of pregnant women in the province of Quebec (Canada) using a Web panel. 
4429,1,"Eligibility criteria included age > 18 years, > 16 weeks pregnant, low-risk pregnancy, and having decided about prenatal screening for the current pregnancy. "
4430,1,"We collected data based on an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior assessing 7 psychosocial constructs (intention, attitude, anticipated regret, subjective norm, descriptive norm, moral norm, and perceived control), 3 related sets of beliefs (behavioral, normative, and control beliefs), 4 health literacy variables, and sociodemographics. "
4431,1,Eligible women watched a video depicting the behavior of interest before completing a Web-based questionnaire. 
4432,1,"We performed descriptive, bivariate, and ordinal logistic regression analyses."
4433,2,"Of the 383 eligible pregnant women who agreed to participate, 350 pregnant women completed the Web-based questionnaire and 346 were retained for analysis (completion rate 350/383, 91.4%; mean age 30.1, SD 4.3, years). "
4434,2,"In order of importance, factors influencing intention to use a DA for prenatal screening for DS were attitude (odds ratio, OR, 9.16, 95% CI 4.02-20.85), moral norm (OR 7.97, 95% CI 4.49-14.14), descriptive norm (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.63-4.92), and anticipated regret (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.71-3.46). "
4435,2,"Specific attitudinal beliefs significantly related to intention were that using a DA would reassure them (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.73-4.01), facilitate their reflections with their spouse (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.05-2.29), and let them know about the advantages of doing or not doing the test (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.05-2.24). "
4436,2,Health literacy did not add to the predictive power of our model (P values range.43-.92).
4437,3,"Implementation interventions targeting the use of a DA for prenatal screening for DS by pregnant women should address a number of modifiable factors, especially by introducing the advantages of using the DA (attitude), informing pregnant women that they might regret not using it (anticipated regret), and presenting the use of DAs as a common practice (descriptive norm). "
4438,3,"However, interventions on moral norms related to the use of DA should be treated with caution. "
4439,3,Further studies that include populations with low health literacy are needed before decisive claims can be made.
4440,4,Impact of Game-Inspired Infographics on User Engagement and Information Processing in an eHealth Program
4441,0,Online interventions providing individual health behavior assessment should deliver feedback in a way that is both understandable and engaging. 
4442,0,This study focused on the potential for infographics inspired by the aesthetics of game design to contribute to these goals.
4443,1,"Between-participants experiments compared game-inspired infographics with traditional formats in terms of outcomes related to information processing (eg, comprehension, cognitive load) and engagement (eg, attitudes toward the information, emotional tone). "
4444,1,"We randomly assigned participants (N=1162) to an experiment in 1 of 6 modules (tobacco use, alcohol use, vegetable consumption, fruit consumption, physical activity, and weight management)."
4445,2,"In the tobacco module, a game-inspired format (scorecard) was compared with text-only; there were no differences in attitudes and emotional tone, but the scorecard outperformed text-only on comprehension (P=.004) and decreased cognitive load (P=.006). "
4446,2,"For the other behaviors, we tested 2 game-inspired formats (scorecard, progress bar) and a traditional column chart; there were no differences in comprehension, but the progress bar outperformed the other formats on attitudes and emotional tone (P<.001 for all contrasts)."
4447,3,"Across modules, a game-inspired infographic showed potential to outperform a traditional format for some study outcomes while not underperforming on other outcomes. "
4448,3,"Overall, findings support the use of game-inspired infographics in behavioral assessment feedback to enhance comprehension and engagement, which may lead to greater behavior change."
4449,4,An Evaluation and Ranking of Childrens Hospital Websites in the United States
4450,0,Children's hospitals are faced with the rising need for technological innovation. 
4451,0,"Their prospective health care consumers, who increasingly depend on the Web and social media for communication and consumer engagement, drive this need. "
4452,0,"As patients and family members navigate the Web presence of hospitals, it is important for these specialized organizations to present themselves and their services efficiently."
4453,1,All websites associated with a children's hospital were identified using a census list of all children's hospitals in the United States. 
4454,1,"In March of 2014, each website and its social media were evaluated using a Web crawler that provided a 5-dimensional assessment that included website accessibility, marketing, content, technology, and usability. "
4455,1,The 5-dimensional assessment was scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 10 with positive findings rated higher on the scale. 
4456,1,Websites were ranked by individual dimensions as well as according to their average ranking across all dimensions.
4457,2,Mean scores of 153 websites ranged from 5.05 to 8.23 across all 5 dimensions. 
4458,2,Results revealed that no website scored a perfect 10 on any dimension and that room exists for meaningful improvement.
4459,3,Study findings allow for the establishment of baseline benchmarks for tracking future website and social media improvements and display the need for enhanced Web-based consumer engagement for children's hospitals.
4460,4,Readability Analysis of the Package Leaflets for Biological Medicines Available on the Internet Between 2007 and 2013: An Analytical Longitudinal Study
4461,0,The package leaflet included in the packaging of all medicinal products plays an important role in the transmission of medicine-related information to patients. 
4462,0,"Therefore, in 2009, the European Commission published readability guidelines to try to ensure that the information contained in the package leaflet is understood by patients."
4463,1,"The sample of this study included 36 biological medicine package leaflets that were downloaded from the European Medicines Agency website in three different years: 2007, 2010, and 2013. "
4464,1,"The readability of the selected package leaflets was obtained using the following readability formulas: SMOG grade, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, and Szigriszt's perspicuity index. "
4465,1,The length (number of words) of the package leaflets was also measured. 
4466,1,"Afterwards, the relationship between these quantitative variables (three readability indexes and length) and categorical (or qualitative) variables were analyzed. "
4467,1,"The categorical variables were the year when the package leaflet was downloaded, the package leaflet section, type of medicine, year of authorization of biological medicine, and marketing authorization holder."
4468,2,"The readability values of all the package leaflets exceeded the sixth-grade reading level, which is the recommended value for health-related written materials. "
4469,2,"No statistically significant differences were found between the three years of study in the readability indexes, although differences were observed in the case of the length (P=.002), which increased over the study period. "
4470,2,"When the relationship between readability indexes and length and the other variables was analyzed, statistically significant differences were found between package leaflet sections (P<.001) and between the groups of medicine only with regard to the length over the three studied years (P=.002 in 2007, P=.007 in 2010, P=.009 in 2013). "
4471,2,"Linear correlation was observed between the readability indexes (SMOG grade and Flesch-Kincaid grade level: r(2)=.92; SMOG grade and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r(2)=.81; Flesch-Kincaid grade level and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r(2)=.95), but not between the readability indexes and the length (length and SMOG grade: r(2)=.05; length and Flesch-Kincaid grade level: r(2)=.03; length and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r(2)=.02). "
4472,2,are required to promote the understandability and accessibility of this online health information by patients and thereby contribute to the appropriate use of medicines and medicine safety.
4473,3,There was no improvement in the readability of the package leaflets studied between 2007 and 2013 despite the European Commission's 2009 guideline on the readability of package leaflets. 
4474,3,The results obtained from the different readability formulas coincided from a qualitative point of view. 
4475,3,Efforts to improve the readability of package leaflets for biological medicines are required to promote the understandability and accessibility of this online health information by patients and thereby contribute to the appropriate use of medicines and medicine safety.
4476,4,Including Online-Recruited Seeds: A Respondent-Driven Sample of Men Who Have Sex With Men
4477,0,"Technology has changed the way men who have sex with men (MSM) seek sex and socialize, which may impact the implementation of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) among this population. "
4478,0,Initial participants (also known as seeds) are a critical consideration in RDS because they begin the recruitment chains. 
4479,0,"However, little information is available on how the online-recruited seeds may effect RDS implementation."
4480,1,"Between 2012 and 2014, we recruited MSM using RDS in Vancouver, Canada. "
4481,1,RDS weights were used with logistic regression to address each objective.
4482,2,"A total of 119 seeds were used, 85 of whom were online-recruited seeds, to recruit an additional 600 MSM. "
4483,2,"Compared with offline-recruited seeds, online-recruited seeds were less likely to be HIV-positive (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.88), to have attended a gay community group (AOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.90), and to feel gay community involvement was ""very important"" (AOR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03-0.93). "
4484,2,"Online-recruited seeds were more likely to ask a sexual partner's HIV status always versus <50% of the time (AOR 5.21, 95% CI 1.17-23.23), to have watched the Pride parade (AOR 6.30, 95% CI 1.69-23.45), and to have sought sex online (AOR 4.29, 95% CI 1.53-12-12.05). "
4485,2,"Further, compared with recruitment chains started by offline-recruited seeds, recruits from chains started by online-recruited seeds (283/600, 47.2%) were less likely to be HIV-positive (AOR 0.25, 95% CI 0.16-0.40), to report ""versatile"" versus ""bottom"" sexual position preference (AOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.88), and to be in a relationship lasting >1 year (AOR 1.65, 95% CI 1.06-2.56). "
4486,2,"Recruits of online seeds were more likely to be out as gay for longer (eg, 11-21 vs 1-4 years, AOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.27-3.88) and have fewer Facebook friends (eg, 201-500 vs >500, AOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.02-2.80)."
4487,3,"Online-recruited seeds were more prevalent, recruited fewer participants, but were different from those recruited offline. "
4488,3,This may therefore help create a more diverse overall sample. 
4489,3,"Our work has shown the value of geosocial networking apps for aiding RDS recruitment efforts, especially when faced with slow participation uptake by other means. "
4490,3,Understanding the degree to which networks interact will be an important next step in confirming the efficacy of online RDS recruitment strategies.
4491,4,Internet Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Women With Postnatal Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial of MumMoodBooster
4492,0,There are few published controlled trials examining the efficacy of Internet-based treatment for postnatal depression (PND) and none that assess diagnostic status (clinical remission) as the primary outcome. 
4493,0,"This is despite the need to improve treatment uptake and accessibility because fewer than 50% of postnatally depressed women seek help, even when identified as depressed."
4494,1,This was a parallel 2-group RCT (N=43) comparing the Internet CBT treatment (n=21) to treatment as usual (n=22). 
4495,1,"At baseline and at 12 weeks after enrollment, women's diagnostic status was assessed by telephone with the Standardized Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) and symptom severity with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). "
4496,1,Depression symptoms were measured repeatedly throughout the study period with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
4497,2,"At the end of the study, 79% (15/19) of women who received the Internet CBT treatment no longer met diagnostic criteria for depression on the SCID-IV (these outcome data were missing for 2 intervention participants). "
4498,2,This contrasted with only 18% (4/22) remission in the treatment as usual condition. 
4499,2,"Depression scores on the BDI-II showed a large effect favoring the intervention group (d=.83, 95% CI 0.20-1.45). "
4500,2,Small to medium effects were found on the PHQ-9 and on measures of anxiety and stress. 
4501,2,Adherence to the program was very good with 86% (18/21) of users completing all sessions; satisfaction with the program was rated 3.1 out of 4 on average.
4502,3,"Our results suggest that our Internet CBT program, MumMoodBooster, is an effective treatment option for women clinically diagnosed with PND. "
4503,3,This is one of only two controlled evaluations of specialized online psychological treatment among women clinically diagnosed with PND. 
4504,3,"MumMoodBooster appears to be a feasible, effective treatment option, which is potentially accessible to large numbers of women in metropolitan, rural, and remote areas. "
4505,3,Future work might be focused profitably on establishing comparability with face-to-face treatments and purely self-guided delivery. 
4506,3,We have commenced a larger RCT comparing MumMoodBooster with face-to-face CBT.
4507,4,Health-Related Internet Use by Informal Caregivers of Children and Adolescents: An Integrative Literature Review
4508,0,Internet-based health resources can support informal caregivers who are caring for children or adolescents with health care needs. 
4509,0,"However, few studies discriminate informal caregivers' needs from those of their care recipients or those of people caring for adults."
4510,1,"A total of 17 studies were selected from literature searches conducted in 6 electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and EMBASE. "
4511,1,All databases searches were limited to articles published in the years 2004 to 2014 in peer-reviewed publications. 
4512,1,"Search terms consisted of ""health-related Internet use,"" ""eHealth,"" ""Internet use for health-related purpose(s),"" ""Web-based resource(s),"" and ""online resources,"" combined with informal caregiver (or ""parents"") of ""child,"" ""adolescent,"" ""student,"" ""youth,"" and ""teen."" The age range of the children receiving care was limited to younger than 22 years. "
4513,1,Their informal caregivers were defined as persons (parents) who provided unpaid care or assistance to a child or an adolescent with health problems.
4514,2,"Among 17 empirical studies, the majority of informal caregivers of children with medical issues were the parents. "
4515,2,"Quantitative studies (14/17, 77%) reported prevalence and predictors of health-related Internet use, while mixed-methods and qualitative studies (3/17, 24%) investigated informal caregiver perceptions of helpful health-related Internet use and barriers of use. "
4516,2,The prevalence of health-related Internet use varied (11%-90%) dependent upon how health-related Internet use was operationalized and measured. 
4517,2,"Disease-specific information was used for decision making about treatment, while social support via virtual communities and email were used for informal caregiver emotional needs. "
4518,2,A digital divide of Internet access was identified in lower educated minorities. 
4519,2,"Most studies had methodological challenges resulting from convenience sampling, cross-sectional surveys, lack of theoretical frameworks, or no clear definitions of health-related Internet use."
4520,3,This study provides an important understanding of how family members use Internet-based information and support systems during child caregiving. 
4521,3,Healthcare providers and policy makers should integrate family needs into their current practices and policies. 
4522,3,Further rigorous research is required to design efficient and effective nursing interventions.
4523,4,Positive Clinical Outcomes Are Synergistic With Positive Educational Outcomes When Using Telehealth Consulting in General Practice: A Mixed-Methods Study
4524,0,The use of telehealth technology to enable real-time consultations between patients and specialist services (to whom travel may be an impediment to the patient's care) has recently been encouraged in Australia through financial incentives. 
4525,0,"However, the uptake has been both fragmented and inconsistent. "
4526,0,"The potential benefits for patients include access to a broader range of specialist referral services, cost and time saving, and more rapid access to specialist services and a continuum of care through the triangulation of interaction between patient, primary health care providers (general practitioners and nurses), and specialists. "
4527,0,Enhanced broadband connectivity and higher-grade encryption present an opportunity to trial the use of telehealth consulting as an intrinsic element of medical education for both medical students and doctors-in-training within rural practices and Aboriginal Medical Services.
4528,1,The trial closely followed the protocol developed for this complex and multiaspect intervention. 
4529,1,This paper discuses one aspect of the research protocol-using telehealth consultations for medical education-in detail.
4530,2,Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted. 
4531,2,"In the quantitative analysis, free-text comments were made on aspects of Telehealth Consulting for the patient, concerning the quality of the interactions, and the time and cost saving, and also on the leaning opportunities. "
4532,2,Students commented that their involvement enhanced their learning. 
4533,2,"All respondents agreed or strongly agreed that that the interpersonal aspects were satisfactory, with some brief comments supporting their views. "
4534,2,"In the analysis of the qualitative data, five themes emerged from the analyses concerning the educational benefits of Telehealth Consulting for different levels of learners, while three themes were identified concerning clinical benefits."
4535,3,The results demonstrated strong synergies between the learning derived from the telehealth consulting and the clinical benefits to the patient and clinicians involved.
4536,4,Impact of Scientific Versus Emotional Wording of Patient Questions on Doctor-Patient Communication in an Internet Forum: A Randomized Controlled Experiment with Medical Students
4537,0,Medical expert forums on the Internet play an increasing role in patient counseling. 
4538,0,"Therefore, it is important to understand how doctor-patient communication is influenced in such forums both by features of the patients or advice seekers, as expressed in their forum queries, and by characteristics of the medical experts involved."
4539,1,Advanced medical students (in their ninth semester of medical training) were recruited as participants. 
4540,1,Participation in the online forum was part of a communication training embedded in a gynecology course. 
4541,1,"We first measured their biomedical therapeutic health concept (hereinafter called ""biomedical concept""). "
4542,1,Then they participated in an online forum where they answered fictitious patient queries about mammography screening that either included scientific or emotional wording in a between-group design. 
4543,1,"We analyzed participants' replies with regard to the following dimensions: their use of scientific or emotional wording, the amount of communicated information, and their attempt to build a positive doctor-patient relationship."
4544,2,"This study was carried out with 117 medical students (73 women, 41 men, 3 did not indicate their sex). "
4545,2,We found evidence that both the wording of patient queries and the participants' biomedical concept influenced participants' response behavior. 
4546,2,"They answered emotional patient queries in a more emotional way (mean 0.92, SD 1.02) than scientific patient queries (mean 0.26, SD 0.55; t(74) = 3.48, P<.001, d=0.81). "
4547,2,"We also found a significant interaction effect between participants' use of scientific or emotional wording and type of patient query (F-2,F-74=10.29, P<.01, partial eta(2)=0.12) indicating that participants used scientific wording independently of the type of patient query, whereas they used emotional wording particularly when replying to emotional patient queries. "
4548,2,"In addition, the more pronounced the medical experts' biomedical concept was, the more scientifically (adjusted beta=.20; F-1,F-75=2.95, P=.045) and the less emotionally (adjusted beta=-.22; F-1,F-74=3.66, P=.03) they replied to patient queries. "
4549,2,"Finally, we found that participants' biomedical concept predicted their engagement in relationship building (adjusted beta=-.26): The more pronounced their biomedical concept was, the less they attempted to build a positive doctor-patient relationship (F-1,F-74=5.39, P=.02)."
4550,3,Communication training for medical experts could aim to address this issue of recognizing patients' communication styles and needs in certain situations in order to teach medical experts how to take those aspects adequately into account. 
4551,3,"In addition, communication training should also make medical experts aware of their individual therapeutic health concepts and the consequential implications in communication situations."
4552,4,Comparing a Video and Text Version of a Web-Based Computer-Tailored Intervention for Obesity Prevention: A Randomized Controlled Trial
4553,0,"Web-based computer-tailored interventions often suffer from small effect sizes and high drop-out rates, particularly among people with a low level of education. "
4554,0,Using videos as a delivery format can possibly improve the effects and attractiveness of these interventions
4555,1,A three-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted with a baseline and 6 months follow-up measurement. 
4556,1,"The intervention consisted of six sessions, lasting about 15 minutes each. "
4557,1,"In the video version, the core tailored information was provided by means of videos. "
4558,1,"In the text version, the same tailored information was provided in text format. "
4559,1,"Outcome variables were self-reported and included BMI, physical activity, energy intake, and appreciation of the intervention. "
4560,1,Multiple imputation was used to replace missing values. 
4561,1,The effect analyses were carried out with multiple linear regression analyses and adjusted for confounders. 
4562,1,The process evaluation data were analyzed with independent samples t tests.
4563,2,The baseline questionnaire was completed by 1419 participants and the 6 months follow-up measurement by 1015 participants (71.53%). 
4564,2,No significant interaction effects of educational level were found on any of the outcome variables. 
4565,2,"Compared to the control condition, the video version resulted in lower BMI (B=-0.25, P=.049) and lower average daily energy intake from energy-dense food products (B=-175.58, P<.001), while the text version had an effect only on energy intake (B=-163.05, P=.001). "
4566,2,No effects on physical activity were found. 
4567,2,"Moreover, the video version was rated significantly better than the text version on feelings of relatedness (P=.041), usefulness (P=.047), and grade given to the intervention (P=.018)."
4568,3,The video version of the Web-based computer-tailored obesity prevention intervention was the most effective intervention and most appreciated. 
4569,3,Future research needs to examine if the effects are maintained in the long term and how the intervention can be optimized.
4570,4,An Interactive Computer Session to Initiate Physical Activity in Sedentary Cardiac Patients: Randomized Controlled Trial
4571,0,Physical activity (PA) improves many facets of health. 
4572,0,"Despite this, the majority of American adults are insufficiently active. "
4573,0,Adults who visit a physician complaining of chest pain and related cardiovascular symptoms are often referred for further testing. 
4574,0,"However, when this testing does not reveal an underlying disease or pathology, patients typically receive no additional standard care services. "
4575,0,A PA intervention delivered within the clinic setting may be an effective strategy for improving the health of this population at a time when they may be motivated to take preventive action.
4576,1,This study was part of a larger 2x2 randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of environmental and social-cognitive intervention approaches on the initiation and maintenance of weekly PA for patients post ETT. 
4577,1,"Participants who were referred to an ETT center but had a negative-test (ie, stress tests results indicated no apparent cardiac issues) were randomized to one of four treatment arms: (1) increased environmental accessibility to PA resources via the provision of a free voucher to a fitness facility in close proximity to their home or workplace (ENV), (2) a tailored social cognitive intervention (SC) using a ""5 As""-based (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange) personal action planning tool, (3) combined intervention of both ENV and SC approaches (COMBO), or (4) a matched contact nutrition control (CON). "
4578,1,Each intervention was delivered using a computer-based interactive session. 
4579,1,A general linear model for repeated measures was conducted with change in PA behavior from baseline to 1-month post interactive computer session as the primary outcome.
4580,2,"Sedentary participants (n=452; 34.7% participation rate) without a gym membership (mean age 58.57 years; 59% female, 78% white, 12% black, 11% Hispanic) completed a baseline assessment and an interactive computer session. "
4581,2,"PA increased across the study sample (F-1,F-441= 30.03, P<.001). "
4582,2,"However, a time by condition interaction (F-3,F-441= 8.33, P<. "
4583,2,"001) followed by post hoc analyses indicated that SC participants exhibited a significant increase in weekly PA participation (mean 45.1, SD 10.2) compared to CON (mean -2.5, SD 10.8, P=.004) and ENV (mean 8.3, SD 8.1, P<. "
4584,2,05). 
4585,2,"Additionally, COMBO participants exhibited a significant increase in weekly PA participation (mean 53.4, SD 8.9) compared to CON (P<.001) and ENV (P=.003) participants. "
4586,2,There were no significant differences between ENV and CON or between SC and COMBO.
4587,3,"A brief, computer-based, interactive personal action planning session may be an effective tool to initiate PA within a health care setting, in particular as part of the ETT system."
4588,4,Mobile Exercise Apps and Increased Leisure Time Exercise Activity: A Moderated Mediation Analysis of the Role of Self-Efficacy and Barriers
4589,0,There are currently over 1000 exercise apps for mobile devices on the market. 
4590,0,"These apps employ a range of features, from tracking exercise activity to providing motivational messages. "
4591,0,"However, virtually nothing is known about whether exercise apps improve exercise levels and health outcomes and, if so, the mechanisms of these effects."
4592,1,"In this study, 726 participants with one of three backgrounds were surveyed about their use of exercise apps and health: (1) those who never used exercise apps, (2) those who used exercise apps but discontinued use, and (3) those who are currently using exercise apps. "
4593,1,Participants were asked about their long-term levels of exercise and about their levels of exercise during the previous week with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).
4594,2,Nearly three-quarters of current app users reported being more active compared to under half of non-users and past users. 
4595,2,"The IPAQ showed that current users had higher total leisure time metabolic equivalent of task (MET) expenditures (1169 METs), including walking and vigorous exercise, compared to those who stopped using their apps (612 METs) or who never used apps (577 METs). "
4596,2,"Importantly, physical activity levels in domains other than leisure time activity were similar across the groups. "
4597,2,The results also showed that current users had lower BMI (25.16) than past users (26.8) and non-users (26.9) and that this association was mediated by exercise levels and self-efficacy. 
4598,2,That relationship was also moderated by perceived barriers to exercise. 
4599,2,"Multiple serial mediation models were tested, which revealed that the association between app use and BMI is mediated by increased self-efficacy and increased exercise."
4600,3,"Exercise app users are more likely to exercise during their leisure time, compared to those who do not use exercise apps, essentially fulfilling the role that many of these apps were designed to accomplish. "
4601,3,"Data also suggest that one way that exercise apps may increase exercise levels and health outcomes such as BMI is by making it easier for users to overcome barriers to exercise, leading to increased self-efficacy. "
4602,3,We discuss ways of improving the effectiveness of apps by incorporating theory-driven approaches. 
4603,3,We conclude that exercise apps can be viewed as intervention delivery systems consisting of features that help users overcome specific barriers.
4604,4,Improving Pediatric Basic Life Support Performance Through Blended Learning With Web-Based Virtual Patients: Randomized Controlled Trial
4605,0,E-learning and blended learning approaches gain more and more popularity in emergency medicine curricula. 
4606,0,"So far, little data is available on the impact of such approaches on procedural learning and skill acquisition and their comparison with traditional approaches."
4607,1,A total of 57 medical students were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=30) and a control group (n=27). 
4608,1,Both groups received paper handouts in preparation of simulation-based PBLS training. 
4609,1,The intervention group additionally completed two Web-based VPs with embedded video clips. 
4610,1,"Measurements were taken at randomization (t0), after the preparation period (t1), and after hands-on training (t2). "
4611,1,Clinical decision-making skills and procedural knowledge were assessed at t0 and t1. 
4612,1,"PBLS performance was scored regarding adherence to the correct algorithm, conformance to temporal demands, and the quality of procedural steps at t1 and t2. "
4613,1,Participants' self-assessments were recorded in all three measurements.
4614,2,Procedural knowledge of the intervention group was significantly superior to that of the control group at t1. 
4615,2,"At t2, the intervention group showed significantly better adherence to the algorithm and temporal demands, and better procedural quality of PBLS in objective measures than did the control group. "
4616,2,"These aspects differed between the groups even at t1 (after VPs, prior to practical training). "
4617,2,Self-assessments differed significantly only at t1 in favor of the intervention group.
4618,3,Training with VPs combined with hands-on training improves PBLS performance as judged by objective measures.
4619,4,Nothing About Me Without Me: An Interpretative Review of Patient Accessible Electronic Health Records
4620,0,Patient accessible electronic health records (PAEHRs) enable patients to access and manage personal clinical information that is made available to them by their health care providers (HCPs). 
4621,0,It is thought that the shared management nature of medical record access improves patient outcomes and improves patient satisfaction. 
4622,0,"However, recent reviews have found that this is not the case. "
4623,0,"Furthermore, little research has focused on PAEHRs from the HCP viewpoint. "
4624,0,"HCPs include physicians, nurses, and service providers."
4625,1,A systematic search was conducted using Web of Science to identify review articles on the impact of PAEHRs. 
4626,1,Our search was limited to English-language reviews published between January 2002 and November 2014. 
4627,1,"A total of 73 citations were retrieved from a series of Boolean search terms including ""review*"" with ""patient access to records"". "
4628,1,These reviews went through a novel scoring system analysis whereby we calculated how many positive outcomes were reported per every outcome measure investigated. 
4629,1,This provided a way to quantify the impact of PAEHRs.
4630,2,"Ten reviews covering chronic patients (eg, diabetes and hypertension) and primary care patients, as well as HCPs were found but eight were included for the analysis of outcome measures. "
4631,2,"We found mixed outcomes across both patient and HCP groups, with approximately half of the reviews showing positive changes with record access. "
4632,2,"Patients believe that record access increases their perception of control; however, outcome measures thought to create psychological concerns (such as patient anxiety as a result of seeing their medical record) are still unanswered. "
4633,2,Nurses are more likely than physicians to gain time efficiencies by using a PAEHR system with the main concern from physicians being the security of the PAEHRs.
4634,3,"This review implements a novel scoring system, which shows there is a lack of rigorous empirical testing that separates the effect of record access from other existing disease management programs. "
4635,3,"Current research is too targeted within certain clinical groups' needs, and although there are positive signs for the adoption of PAEHRs, there is currently insufficient evidence about the effect of PAEHRs on health outcomes for patients or HCPs."
4636,4,Personal Electronic Health Records: Understanding User Requirements and Needs in Chronic Cancer Care
4637,0,The integration of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) is becoming increasingly important in reorganizing health care. 
4638,0,Adapting ICTs as supportive tools to users' needs and daily practices is vital for adoption and use.
4639,1,A qualitative study across health care sectors and health professions was conducted in a regional health care setting in Germany. 
4640,1,"Overall, 10 semistructured focus groups were performed, collecting views of 3 prospective user groups: patients with colorectal cancer (n=12) and representatives from patient support groups (n=2), physicians (n=17), and non-medical HCPs (n=16). "
4641,1,"Data were audio- and videotaped, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed using qualitative content analysis."
4642,2,"For both patients and HCPs, it was central to have a tool representing the chronology of illness and its care processes, for example, patients wanted to track their long-term laboratory findings (eg, tumor markers). "
4643,2,Designing health information in a patient accessible way was highlighted as important. 
4644,2,Users wanted to have general and tumor-specific health information available in a PEPA. 
4645,2,"Functions such as filtering information and adding information by patients (eg, on their well-being or electronic communication with HCPs via email) were discussed."
4646,3,"In order to develop a patient/user centered tool that is tailored to user needs, it is essential to address their perspectives. "
4647,3,A challenge for implementation will be how to design PEPA's health data in a patient accessible way. 
4648,3,Adequate patient support and technical advice for users have to be addressed.
4649,4,Web-Based Psychotherapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in War-Traumatized Arab Patients: Randomized Controlled Trial
4650,0,"In recent years, armed conflicts in the Middle East have resulted in high rates of exposure to traumatic events. "
4651,0,"Despite the increasing demand of mental health care provision, ongoing violence limits conventional approaches of mental health care provision. "
4652,0,"Internet-based interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have proved feasible and effective in Western countries, but their applicability and efficacy in war and conflict regions remains unknown."
4653,1,A total of 159 individuals with PTSD participated in a parallel group randomized trial. 
4654,1,Participants were randomly allocated by a computer-generated sequence to a treatment group (n=79) or a waiting list control group (n=80). 
4655,1,The treatment group received 2 weekly 45-minute cognitive behavioral interventions via Internet over a 5-week period (10 sessions in total). 
4656,1,The primary outcome was recovery from posttraumatic stress symptoms.
4657,2,"Posttraumatic stress symptoms were significantly reduced from baseline to posttreatment (intention-to-treat analysis) in the treatment group relative to the control group (F-1,F-157=44.29, P<.001, d=0.92). "
4658,2,Treatment effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up. 
4659,2,"Completer analysis indicated that 29 of 47 patients (62%) in the treatment group had recovered from posttraumatic stress symptoms at posttreatment (reliable change and Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale score <20) versus 1 patient (2%) in the control group (OR 74.19, 95% CI 9.93-585.8, P<.001) indicating that the chance of recovering was 74.19 times higher in the treatment than in the control group."
4660,3,"The results indicate, even in unstable and insecure settings with ongoing exposure to human rights violations through war and dictatorships, people with posttraumatic stress symptoms benefit from a cognitive behavioral treatment provided entirely through the Internet. "
4661,3,This method of delivery could improve patients' access to humanitarian aid in the form of e-mental health services.
4662,4,Systems Medicine 2.0: Potential Benefits of Combining Electronic Health Care Records With Systems Science Models
4663,0,The global burden of disease is increasingly dominated by non-communicable diseases. 
4664,0,These diseases are less amenable to curative and preventative interventions than communicable disease. 
4665,0,"This presents a challenge to medical practice and medical research, both of which are experiencing diminishing returns from increasing investment."
4666,1,We undertook an unsystematic review of peer-reviewed literature and technology websites.
4667,2,Our review generated the following conclusions and recommendations. 
4668,2,(1) Medical knowledge continues to be generated in a reductionist paradigm. 
4669,2,"This oversimplifies our models of disease, rendering them ineffective to sufficiently understand the complex nature of non-communicable diseases. "
4670,2,"(2) Some of these failings may be overcome by adopting a ""Systems Medicine"" paradigm, where the human body is modeled as a complex adaptive system. "
4671,2,"That is, a system with multiple components and levels interacting in complex ways, wherein disease emerges from slow changes to the system set-up. "
4672,2,Pursuing systems medicine research will require larger datasets. 
4673,2,"(3) Increased data sharing between researchers, patients, and clinicians could provide this unmet need for data. "
4674,2,The recent emergence of electronic health care records (EHR) could potentially facilitate this in real-time and at a global level. 
4675,2,(4) Efforts should continue to aggregate anonymous EHR data into large interoperable data silos and release this to researchers. 
4676,2,"However, international collaboration, data linkage, and obtaining additional information from patients will remain challenging. "
4677,2,"(5) Efforts should also continue towards ""Medicine 2.0"". "
4678,2,Patients should be given access to their personal EHR data. 
4679,2,"Subsequently, online communities can give researchers the opportunity to ask patients for direct access to the patient's EHR data and request additional study-specific information. "
4680,2,"However, selection bias towards patients who use Web 2.0 technology may be difficult to overcome."
4681,3,"Systems medicine, when combined with large-scale data sharing, has the potential to raise our understanding of non-communicable diseases, foster personalized medicine, and make substantial progress towards halting, curing, and preventing non-communicable diseases. "
4682,3,Large-scale data amalgamation remains a core challenge and needs to be supported. 
4683,3,"A synthesis of ""Medicine 2.0"" and ""Systems Science"" concepts into ""Systems Medicine 2.0"" could take decades to materialize but holds much promise."
4684,4,Exploring How the Tobacco Industry Presents and Promotes Itself in Social Media
4685,0,The commercial potential of social media is utilized by tobacco manufacturers and vendors for tobacco promotion online. 
4686,0,"However, the prevalence and promotional strategies of pro-tobacco content in social media are still not widely understood."
4687,1,The top 70 popular cigarette brands are divided into two groups according to their retail prices: group H (brands with high retail prices) and group L (brands with low retail prices). 
4688,1,"Three comprehensive searches were conducted on Facebook, Wikipedia, and YouTube respectively using the top 70 popular cigarette brands as keywords. "
4689,1,"We identified tobacco-related content including history and culture, product features, health warnings, home page of cigarette brands, and Web-based tobacco shops. "
4690,1,"Furthermore, we examined the promotional strategies utilized in social media."
4691,2,"According to the data collected from March 3, 2014 to March 10, 2014, 43 of the 70 representative cigarette brands had created 238 Facebook fan pages, 46 cigarette brands were identified in Wikipedia, and there were over 120,000 pro-tobacco videos on YouTube, associated with 61 cigarette brands. "
4692,2,The main content presented on the three social media websites differs significantly. 
4693,2,"Wikipedia focuses on history and culture (67%, 32/48; P<.001). "
4694,2,"Facebook mainly covers history and culture (37%, 16/43; P<.001) and major products (35%, 15/43), while YouTube focuses on the features of major tobacco products (79%, 48/61; P=.04) and information about Web-based shops (49%, 30/61; P=.004). "
4695,2,"Concerning the content presented by groups H and L, there is no significant difference between the two groups. "
4696,2,"With regard to the promotional strategies used, sales promotions exist extensively in social media. "
4697,2,"Sales promotion is more prevalent on YouTube than on the other two sites (64%, 39/61 vs 35%, 15/43; P=.004). "
4698,2,"Generally, the sale promotions of higher-cost brands in social media are more prevalent than those of lower-cost brands (55%, 16/29 vs 7%, 1/14; P<.001 for Facebook; 78%, 28/36 vs 44%, 11/25; P=.005 for YouTube)."
4699,3,The prevalence of cigarette brands in social media allows more pro-tobacco information to be accessed by online users. 
4700,3,This dilemma indicates that corresponding regulations should be established to prevent tobacco promotion in social media.
4701,4,Development and Assessment of an E-Learning Course on Breast Imaging for Radiographers: A Stratified Randomized Controlled Trial
4702,0,"Mammography is considered the best imaging technique for breast cancer screening, and the radiographer plays an important role in its performance. "
4703,0,"Therefore, continuing education is critical to improving the performance of these professionals and thus providing better health care services."
4704,1,"A stratified randomized controlled trial was performed with radiographers and radiology students who already had mammography training, using pre-and post-knowledge tests, and satisfaction questionnaires. "
4705,1,"The primary outcome was the improvement in test results (percentage of correct answers), using intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis."
4706,2,A total of 54 participants were assigned to the intervention (20 students plus 34 radiographers) with 53 controls (19+ 34). 
4707,2,"The intervention was completed by 40 participants (11+ 29), with 4 (2+ 2) discontinued interventions, and 10 (7+ 3) lost to follow-up. "
4708,2,"Differences in the primary outcome were found between intervention and control: 21 versus 4 percentage points (pp), P<. "
4709,2,1
4710,2,Stratified analysis showed effect in radiographers (23 pp vs 4 pp; P=.004) but was unclear in students (18 pp vs 5 pp; P=.098). 
4711,2,"Nonetheless, differences in students' posttest results were found (88% vs 63%; P=.003), which were absent in pretest (63% vs 63%; P=.106). "
4712,2,The per-protocol analysis showed a higher effect (26 pp vs 2 pp; P<. 
4713,2,"001), both in students (25 pp vs 3 pp; P=.004) and radiographers (27 pp vs 2 pp; P<. "
4714,2,001). 
4715,2,"Overall, 85% were satisfied with the course, and 88% considered it successful."
4716,3,"This e-learning course is effective, especially for radiographers, which highlights the need for continuing education."
4717,4,An Observational Study of Social and Emotional Support in Smoking Cessation Twitter Accounts: Content Analysis of Tweets
4718,0,Smoking continues to be the number one preventable cause of premature death in the United States. 
4719,0,"While evidence for the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions has increased rapidly, questions remain on how to effectively disseminate these findings. "
4720,0,"Twitter, the second largest online social network, provides a natural way of disseminating information. "
4721,0,"Health communicators can use Twitter to inform smokers, provide social support, and attract them to other interventions. "
4722,0,A key challenge for health researchers is how to frame their communications to maximize the engagement of smokers.
4723,1,Active smoking cessation related Twitter accounts (N=18) were identified. 
4724,1,"Their 50 most recent tweets were content coded using a schema adapted from the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), a theory-based, validated coding method. "
4725,1,"Using negative binomial regression, the association of number of followers and frequency of individual tweet content at baseline was assessed. "
4726,1,The difference in followership at 6 months (compared to baseline) to the frequency of tweet content was compared using linear regression. 
4727,1,Both analyses were adjusted by account type (organizational or not organizational).
4728,2,"The 18 accounts had 60,609 followers at baseline and 68,167 at 6 months. "
4729,2,"A total of 24% of tweets were socioemotional support (mean 11.8, SD 9.8), 14% (mean 7, SD 8.4) were encouraging/engagement, and 62% (mean 31.2, SD 15.2) were informational. "
4730,2,"At baseline, higher frequency of socioemotional support and encouraging/engaging tweets was significantly associated with higher number of followers (socioemotional: incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.20; encouraging/engaging: IRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.12). "
4731,2,"Conversely, higher frequency of informational tweets was significantly associated with lower number of followers (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98). "
4732,2,"At 6 months, for every increase by 1 in socioemotional tweets, the change in followership significantly increased by 43.94 (P=.027); the association was slightly attenuated after adjusting by account type and was not significant (P=.064)."
4733,3,Smoking cessation activity does exist on Twitter. 
4734,3,"Preliminary findings suggest that certain content strategies can be used to encourage followership, and this needs to be further investigated."
4735,4,Motivations for Contributing to Health-Related Articles on Wikipedia: An Interview Study
4736,0,Wikipedia is one of the most accessed sources of health information online. 
4737,0,"The current English-language Wikipedia contains more than 28,000 articles pertaining to health."
4738,1,"A set of health-related articles were randomly selected and recent contributors invited to complete an online questionnaire and follow-up interview (by Skype, by email, or face-to-face). "
4739,1,Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis and a realist grounded theory approach.
4740,2,A total of 32 Wikipedians (31 men) completed the questionnaire and 17 were interviewed. 
4741,2,"Those completing the questionnaire had a mean age of 39 (range 12-59) years; 16 had a postgraduate qualification, 10 had or were currently studying for an undergraduate qualification, 3 had no more than secondary education, and 3 were still in secondary education. "
4742,2,"In all, 15 were currently working in a health-related field (primarily clinicians). "
4743,2,The median period for which they have been an active editing Wikipedia was 3-5 years. 
4744,2,"Of this group, 12 were in the United States, 6 were in the United Kingdom, 4 were in Canada, and the remainder from another 8 countries. "
4745,2,Two-thirds spoke more than 1 language and 90% (29/32) were also active contributors in domains other than health. 
4746,2,"Wikipedians in this study were identified as health professionals, professionals with specific health interests, students, and individuals with health problems. "
4747,2,"Based on the interviews, their motivations for editing health-related content were summarized in 5 strongly interrelated categories: education (learning about subjects by editing articles), help (wanting to improve and maintain Wikipedia), responsibility (responsibility, often a professional responsibility, to provide good quality health information to readers), fulfillment (editing Wikipedia as a fun, relaxing, engaging, and rewarding activity), and positive attitude to Wikipedia (belief in the value of Wikipedia). "
4748,2,"An additional factor, hostility (from other contributors), was identified that negatively affected Wikipedians' motivations."
4749,3,Contributions to Wikipedia's health-related content in this study were made by both health specialists and laypeople of varying editorial skills. 
4750,3,"Their motivations for contributing stem from an inherent drive based on values, standards, and beliefs. "
4751,3,It became apparent that the community who most actively monitor and edit health-related articles is very small. 
4752,3,"Although some contributors correspond to a model of ""knowledge philanthropists,"" others were focused on maintaining articles (improving spelling and grammar, organization, and handling vandalism). "
4753,3,There is a need for more people to be involved in Wikipedia's health-related content.
4754,4,Estimation of Geographic Variation in Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Uptake in Men and Women: An Online Survey Using Facebook Recruitment
4755,0,Federally funded surveys of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake are important for pinpointing geographically based health disparities. 
4756,0,"Although national and state level data are available, local (ie, county and postal code level) data are not due to small sample sizes, confidentiality concerns, and cost. "
4757,0,"Local level HPV vaccine uptake data may be feasible to obtain by targeting specific geographic areas through social media advertising and recruitment strategies, in combination with online surveys."
4758,1,"From November 2012 to January 2013, men and women were recruited via a targeted Facebook advertisement campaign to complete an online survey about HPV vaccination practices. "
4759,1,"The Facebook advertisements were targeted to recruit men and women by location (25 mile radius of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), age (18-30 years), and language (English)."
4760,2,"Of the 2079 men and women who responded to the Facebook advertisements and visited the study website, 1003 (48.2%) enrolled in the study and completed the survey. "
4761,2,The average advertising cost per completed survey was US $1.36. 
4762,2,"Among those who reported their postal code, 90.6% (881/972) of the participants lived within the previously defined geographic study area. "
4763,2,"Receipt of 1 dose or more of HPV vaccine was reported by 65.6% women (351/535), and 13.0% (45/347) of men. "
4764,2,These results differ from previously reported Minnesota state level estimates (53.8% for young women and 20.8% for young men) and from national estimates (34.5% for women and 2.3% for men).
4765,3,This study shows that recruiting a representative sample of young men and women based on county and postal code location to complete a survey on HPV vaccination uptake via the Internet is a cost-effective and feasible strategy. 
4766,3,"This study also highlights the need for local estimates to assess the variation in HPV vaccine uptake, as these estimates differ considerably from those obtained using survey data that are aggregated to the state or federal level."
4767,4,Numeracy and Literacy Independently Predict Patients Ability to Identify Out-of-Range Test Results
4768,0,Increasing numbers of patients have direct access to laboratory test results outside of clinical consultations. 
4769,0,This offers increased opportunities for both self-management of chronic conditions and advance preparation for clinic visits if patients are able to identify test results that are outside the reference ranges.
4770,1,"In an Internet-administered survey, adults aged 40-70 years, approximately half with diabetes, were asked to imagine that they had type 2 diabetes. "
4771,1,They were shown laboratory test results displayed in a standard tabular format. 
4772,1,"We randomized hemoglobin A(1c) values to be slightly (7.1%) or moderately (8.4%) outside the reference range and randomized other test results to be within or outside their reference ranges (ie, multiple deviations). "
4773,1,"We assessed (1) whether respondents identified the hemoglobin A(1c) level as outside the reference range, (2) how respondents rated glycemic control, and (3) whether they would call their doctor. "
4774,1,We also measured numeracy and health literacy.
4775,2,"Among the 1817 adult participants, viewing test results with multiple deviations increased the probability of identifying hemoglobin A(1c) values as outside the reference range (participants with diabetes: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.12-1.92, P=.005; participants without diabetes: OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13-2.00, P=.005). "
4776,2,Both numeracy and health literacy were significant predictors of correctly identifying out-of-range values. 
4777,2,"For participants with diabetes, numeracy OR 1.32 per unit on a 1-6 scale (95% CI 1.15-1.51, P<.001) and literacy OR 1.59 per unit of a 1-5 scale (95% CI 1.35-1.87, P<.001); for participants without diabetes, numeracy OR 1.36 per unit (95% CI 1.17-1.58, P<.001) and literacy OR 1.33 per unit (95% CI 1.12-1.58, P=.001). "
4778,2,"Predicted probabilities suggested 77% of higher numeracy and health literacy participants, but only 38% of lower numeracy and literacy participants, could correctly identify the hemoglobin A(1c) levels as outside the reference range. "
4779,2,"Correct identification reduced perceived blood glucose control (mean difference 1.68-1.71 points on a 0-10 scale, P<.001). "
4780,2,"For participants with diabetes, increased health literacy reduced the likelihood of calling one's doctor when hemoglobin A(1c)=7.1% (OR 0.66 per unit, 95% CI 0.52-0.82, P<.001) and increased numeracy increased intention to call when hemoglobin A(1c)= 8.4% (OR 1.36 per unit, 95% CI 1.10-1.69, P=.005)."
4781,3,Limited health literacy and numeracy skills are significant barriers to basic use of laboratory test result data as currently presented in some EHR portals. 
4782,3,"Regarding contacting their doctor, less numerate and literate participants with diabetes appear insensitive to the hemoglobin A(1c) level shown, whereas highly numerate and literate participants with diabetes appear very sensitive. "
4783,3,Alternate approaches appear necessary to make test results more meaningful.
4784,4,"Assessing the Applicability of E-Therapies for Depression, Anxiety, and Other Mood Disorders Among Lesbians and Gay Men: Analysis of 24 Web- and Mobile Phone-Based Self-Help Interventions"
4785,0,"Lesbians and gay men have disproportionately high rates of depression and anxiety, and report lower satisfaction with treatments. "
4786,0,"In part, this may be because many health care options marginalize them by assuming heterosexuality, or misunderstand and fail to respond to the challenges specifically faced by these groups. "
4787,0,"E-therapies have particular potential to respond to the mental health needs of lesbians and gay men, but there is little research to determine whether they do so, or how they might be improved."
4788,1,"We reviewed 24 Web-and mobile phone-based e-therapies and assessed their performance in eight key areas, including the use of inclusive language and content and whether they addressed mental health stressors for lesbians and gay men, such as experiences of stigma related to their sexual orientation, coming out, and relationship issues that are specific to lesbians and gay men."
4789,2,We found that e-therapies seldom addressed these stressors. 
4790,2,"Furthermore, 58% (14/24) of therapies contained instances that assumed or suggested the user was heterosexual, with instances especially prevalent among better-evidenced programs."
4791,3,"Our findings, and a detailed review protocol presented in this article, may be used as guides for the future development of mental health e-therapies to better accommodate the needs of lesbians and gay men."
4792,4,Evaluating User Experiences of the Secure Messaging Tool on the Veterans Affairs Patient Portal System
4793,0,"The United States Department of Veterans Affairs has implemented an electronic asynchronous ""Secure Messaging"" tool within a Web-based patient portal (ie, My HealtheVet) to support patient-provider communication. "
4794,0,"This electronic resource promotes continuous and coordinated patient-centered care, but to date little research has evaluated patients' experiences and preferences for using Secure Messaging."
4795,1,We recruited 33 veterans who had access to and had previously used the portal's Secure Messaging tool. 
4796,1,"We used a combination of in-depth interviews, face-to-face user-testing, review of transmitted secure messages between veterans and staff, and telephone interviews three months following initial contact. "
4797,1,We assessed participants' computer and health literacy during initial and follow-up interviews. 
4798,1,We used a content-analysis approach to identify dominant themes in the qualitative data. 
4799,1,"We compared inferences from each of the data sources (interviews, user-testing, and message review) to identify convergent and divergent data trends."
4800,2,"The majority of veterans (27/33, 82%) reported being satisfied with Secure Messaging at initial interview; satisfaction ratings increased to 97% (31/32, 1 missing) during follow-up interviews. "
4801,2,"Veterans noted Secure Messaging to be useful for communicating with their primary care team to manage health care needs (eg, health-related questions, test requests and results, medication refills and questions, managing appointments). "
4802,2,"Four domains emerged from interviews: (1) perceived benefits of using Secure Messaging, (2) barriers to using Secure Messaging, (3) facilitators for using Secure Messaging, and (4) suggestions for improving Secure Messaging. "
4803,2,"Veterans identified and demonstrated impediments to successful system usage that can be addressed with education, skill building, and system modifications. "
4804,2,"Analysis of secure message content data provided insights to reasons for use that were not disclosed by participants during interviews, specifically sensitive health topics such as erectile dysfunction and sexually transmitted disease inquiries."
4805,3,Veterans perceive Secure Messaging in the My HealtheVet patient portal as a useful tool for communicating with health care teams. 
4806,3,"However, to maximize sustained utilization of Secure Messaging, marketing, education, skill building, and system modifications are needed. "
4807,3,Data from this study can inform a large-scale quantitative assessment of Secure Messaging users' experiences in a representative sample to validate qualitative findings.
4808,4,Tailored and Integrated Web-Based Tools for Improving Psychosocial Outcomes of Cancer Patients: The DoTTI Development Framework
4809,0,"Effective communication with cancer patients and their families about their disease, treatment options, and possible outcomes may improve psychosocial outcomes. "
4810,0,"However, traditional approaches to providing information to patients, including verbal information and written booklets, have a number of shortcomings centered on their limited ability to meet patient preferences and literacy levels. "
4811,0,"New-generation Web-based technologies offer an innovative and pragmatic solution for overcoming these limitations by providing a platform for interactive information seeking, information sharing, and user-centered tailoring."
4812,1,The proposed framework draws on our experience of constructing a Web-based information tool for hematological cancer patients and their families. 
4813,1,The framework is based on principles for the development and evaluation of complex interventions and draws on the Agile methodology of software programming that emphasizes collaboration and iteration throughout the development process.
4814,2,The DoTTI framework provides a model for a comprehensive and iterative approach to the development of Web-based informational tools for patients. 
4815,2,"The process involves 4 phases of development: (1) Design and development, (2) Testing early iterations, (3) Testing for effectiveness, and (4) Integration and implementation. "
4816,2,"At each step, stakeholders (including researchers, clinicians, consumers, and programmers) are engaged in consultations to review progress, provide feedback on versions of the Web-based tool, and based on feedback, determine the appropriate next steps in development."
4817,3,This 4-phase framework is evidence-informed and consumer-centered and could be applied widely to develop Web-based programs for a diverse range of diseases.
4818,4,"Animated Randomness, Avatars, Movement, and Personalization in Risk Graphics"
4819,0,Risk communication involves conveying two inherently difficult concepts about the nature of risk: the underlying random distribution of outcomes and how a population-based proportion applies to an individual.
4820,1,A diverse sample of 3630 adults with no previous heart disease or stroke completed an online nested factorial experiment in which they entered personal health data into a risk calculator that estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease based on a robust and validated model. 
4821,1,We randomly assigned them to view their results in 1 of 10 risk graphics that used different combinations of the 4 design factors. 
4822,1,"We measured participants' risk perceptions as our primary outcome, as well as behavioral intentions and recall of the risk estimate. "
4823,1,"We also assessed subjective numeracy, whether or not participants knew anyone who had died of cardiovascular causes, and whether or not they knew their blood pressure and cholesterol as potential moderators."
4824,2,"Animated randomness was associated with better alignment between risk estimates and risk perceptions (F-1,F-3576= 6.12, P=.01); however, it also led to lower scores on healthy lifestyle intentions (F-1,F-3572=11.1, P<. "
4825,2,001). 
4826,2,"Using an avatar increased risk perceptions overall (F-1,F-3576=4.61, P=.03) and most significantly increased risk perceptions among those who did not know a particular person who had experienced the grave outcomes of cardiovascular disease (F-1,F-3576= 5.88, P=.02). "
4827,2,"Using an avatar also better aligned actual risk estimates with intentions to see a doctor (F-1,F-3556= 6.38, P=.01). "
4828,2,"No design factors had main effects on recall, but animated randomness was associated with better recall for those at lower risk and worse recall for those at higher risk (F-1,F-3544= 7.06, P=.01)."
4829,3,Animated randomness may help people better understand the random nature of risk. 
4830,3,"However, in the context of cardiovascular risk, such understanding may result in lower healthy lifestyle intentions. "
4831,3,"Therefore, whether or not to display randomness may depend on whether one's goal is to persuade or to inform. "
4832,3,Avatars show promise for helping people grasp how population-based statistics map to an individual case.
4833,4,Social Media and Rating Sites as Tools to Understanding Quality of Care: A Scoping Review
4834,0,"Insight into the quality of health care is important for any stakeholder including patients, professionals, and governments. "
4835,0,"In light of a patient-centered approach, it is essential to assess the quality of health care from a patient's perspective, which is commonly done with surveys or focus groups. "
4836,0,"Unfortunately, these ""traditional"" methods have significant limitations that include social desirability bias, a time lag between experience and measurement, and difficulty reaching large groups of people. "
4837,0,"Information on social media could be of value to overcoming these limitations, since these new media are easy to use and are used by the majority of the population. "
4838,0,"Furthermore, an increasing number of people share health care experiences online or rate the quality of their health care provider on physician rating sites. "
4839,0,The question is whether this information is relevant to determining or predicting the quality of health care.
4840,1,"We performed a scoping review with the following goals: (1) to map the literature on the association between social media and quality of care, (2) to identify different mechanisms of this relationship, and (3) to determine a more detailed agenda for this relatively new research area. "
4841,1,A recognized scoping review methodology was used. 
4842,1,"We developed a search strategy based on four themes: social media, patient experience, quality, and health care. "
4843,1,"Four online scientific databases were searched, articles were screened, and data extracted. "
4844,1,Results related to the research question were described and categorized according to type of social media. 
4845,1,"Furthermore, national and international stakeholders were consulted throughout the study, to discuss and interpret results."
4846,2,"Twenty-nine articles were included, of which 21 were concerned with health care rating sites. "
4847,2,Several studies indicate a relationship between information on social media and quality of health care. 
4848,2,"However, some drawbacks exist, especially regarding the use of rating sites. "
4849,2,"For example, since rating is anonymous, rating values are not risk adjusted and therefore vulnerable to fraud. "
4850,2,"Also, ratings are often based on only a few reviews and are predominantly positive. "
4851,2,"Furthermore, people providing feedback on health care via social media are presumably not always representative for the patient population."
4852,3,Social media and particularly rating sites are an interesting new source of information about quality of care from the patient's perspective. 
4853,3,"This new source should be used to complement traditional methods, since measuring quality of care via social media has other, but not less serious, limitations. "
4854,3,"Future research should explore whether social media are suitable in practice for patients, health insurers, and governments to help them judge the quality performance of professionals and organizations."
4855,4,Mind the Gap: Social Media Engagement by Public Health Researchers
4856,0,The traditional vertical system of sharing information from sources of scientific authority passed down to the public through local health authorities and clinicians risks being made obsolete by emerging technologies that facilitate rapid horizontal information sharing. 
4857,0,"The rise of Public Health 2.0 requires professional acknowledgment that a new and substantive forum of public discourse about public health exists on social media, such as forums, blogs, Facebook, and Twitter."
4858,1,"We conducted a survey of professorial- and scientist-track faculty at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. "
4859,1,"We asked all available faculty via email to complete a 30-question survey about respondent characteristics, beliefs about social media, and usage of specific technologies, including blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube."
4860,2,A total of 181 (19.8%) of 912 professor-and scientist-track faculty provided usable responses. 
4861,2,The majority of respondents rarely used major social media platforms. 
4862,2,"Of these 181 respondents, 97 (53.6%) had used YouTube, 84 (46.4%) had used Facebook, 55 (30.4%) had read blogs, and 12 (6.6%) had used Twitter in the prior month. "
4863,2,More recent degree completion was the best predictor of higher usage of social media. 
4864,2,"In all, 122 (67.4%) agreed that social media is important for disseminating information, whereas only 55 (30.4%) agreed that social media is useful for their research. "
4865,2,"In all, 43 (23.8%) said social media was helpful for professional career advancement, whereas 72 (39.8%) said it was not. "
4866,2,"Only 43 (23.8%) faculty said they would employ a fullor part-time social media consultant, and 30 (16.6%) currently employed one."
4867,3,"Despite near-universal appreciation of the potential for social media to serve as a component of public health strategy, a small minority are actually engaged in this space professionally, whereas most are either disinterested or actively opposed to professional engagement. "
4868,3,Social media is seen by most as more useful for spreading information than obtaining it. 
4869,3,"As public discourse on a number of critical health topics continues to be influenced and sometimes shaped by discussions online from Twitter to Facebook, it would seem that greater discourse is needed about when and how public health professionals should engage in these media, and also how personal, institutional, and professional barriers to greater use of social media may be overcome."
4870,4,The Sexunzipped Trial: Young Peoples Views of Participating in an Online Randomized Controlled Trial
4871,0,Incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among young people in the United Kingdom is increasing. 
4872,0,"The Internet can be a suitable medium for delivery of sexual health information and sexual health promotion, given its high usage among young people, its potential for creating a sense of anonymity, and ease of access. "
4873,0,"Online randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly being used to evaluate online interventions, but while there are many advantages to online methodologies, they can be associated with a number of problems, including poor engagement with online interventions, poor trial retention, and concerns about the validity of data collected through self-report online. "
4874,0,We conducted an online feasibility trial that tested the effects of the Sexunzipped website for sexual health compared to an information-only website. 
4875,0,"This study reports on a qualitative evaluation of the trial procedures, describing participants' experiences and views of the Sexunzipped online trial including methods of recruitment, incentives, methods of contact, and sexual health outcome measurement."
4876,1,"We used three qualitative data sources to assess the acceptability and validity of the online pilot RCT methodology: (1) individual interviews with 22 participants from the pilot RCT, (2) 133 emails received by the trial coordinator from trial participants, and (3) 217 free-text comments from the baseline and follow-up questionnaires. "
4877,1,Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. 
4878,1,"An iterative, thematic analysis of all three data sources was conducted to identify common themes related to the acceptability and feasibility of the online trial methodology."
4879,2,"Interview participants found the trial design, including online recruitment via Facebook, online registration, email communication with the researchers, and online completion of sexual health questionnaires to be highly acceptable and preferable to traditional methods. "
4880,2,Incentives might assist in recruiting those who would not otherwise participate. 
4881,2,Participants generally enjoyed taking part in sexual health research online and found the questionnaire itself thought-provoking. 
4882,2,Completing the sexual health questionnaires online encouraged honesty in responding that might not be achieved with other methods. 
4883,2,The majority of interview participants also thought that receiving and returning a urine sample for chlamydia testing via post was acceptable.
4884,3,"These findings provide strong support for the use of online research methods for sexual health research, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and execution of all trial procedures including recruitment, respondent validation, trial related communication, and methods to maximize follow-up. "
4885,3,"Our findings suggest that sexual health outcome measurement might encourage reflection on current behavior, sometimes leading to behavior change."
4886,4,Leveraging Text Messaging and Mobile Technology to Support Pediatric Obesity-Related Behavior Change: A Qualitative Study Using Parent Focus Groups and Interviews
4887,0,"Text messaging (short message service, SMS) is a widely accessible and potentially cost-effective medium for encouraging behavior change. "
4888,0,Few studies have examined text messaging interventions to influence child health behaviors or explored parental perceptions of mobile technologies to support behavior change among children.
4889,1,"We conducted focus groups and follow-up interviews with parents of overweight and obese children, aged 6-12 years, seen for ""well-child"" care in eastern Massachusetts. "
4890,1,A professional moderator used a semistructured discussion guide and sample text messages to catalyze group discussions. 
4891,1,Seven participants then received 3 weeks of text messages before a follow-up one-on-one telephone interview. 
4892,1,All focus groups and interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. 
4893,1,"Using a framework analysis approach, we systematically coded and analyzed group and interview data to identify salient and convergent themes."
4894,2,We reached thematic saturation after five focus groups and seven follow-up interviews with a total of 31 parents of diverse race/ethnicity and education levels. 
4895,2,Parents were generally enthusiastic about receiving text messages to support healthy behaviors for their children and preferred them to paper or email communication because they are brief and difficult to ignore. 
4896,2,Participants anticipated high responsiveness to messaging endorsed by their child's doctor and indicated they would appreciate messages 2-3 times/week or more as long as content remains relevant. 
4897,2,Suggestions for maintaining message relevance included providing specific strategies for implementation and personalizing information. 
4898,2,"Most felt the negative features of text messaging (eg, limited message size) could be overcome by providing links within messages to other media including email or websites."
4899,3,Text messaging is a promising medium for supporting pediatric obesity-related behavior change. 
4900,3,Parent perspectives could assist in the design of text-based interventions.
4901,4,Design and Evaluation of a Simulation for Pediatric Dentistry in Virtual Worlds
4902,0,Three-dimensional virtual worlds are becoming very popular among educators in the medical field. 
4903,0,Virtual clinics and patients are already used for case study and role play in both undergraduate and continuing education levels. 
4904,0,Dental education can also take advantage of the virtual world's pedagogical features in order to give students the opportunity to interact with virtual patients (VPs) and practice in treatment planning.
4905,1,"A child VP, called Erietta, was created by utilizing the programming and building tools that online virtual worlds offer. "
4906,1,The case is about an eight-year old girl visiting the dentist with her mother for the first time. 
4907,1,Communication techniques such as Tell-Show-Do and parents' interference management were the basic elements of the educational scenario on which the VP was based. 
4908,1,An evaluation of the simulation was made by 103 dental students in their fourth year of study. 
4909,1,Two groups were formed: an experimental group which was exposed to the simulation (n=52) and a control group which did not receive the simulation (n=51). 
4910,1,"At the end, both groups were asked to complete a knowledge questionnaire and the results were compared."
4911,2,"A statistically significant difference between the two groups was found by applying a t test for independent samples (P<.001), showing a positive learning effect from the VP. "
4912,2,The majority of the participants evaluated the aspects of the simulation very positively while 69% (36/52) of the simulation group expressed their preference for using this module as an additional teaching tool.
4913,3,This study demonstrated that a pediatric dentistry VP built in a virtual world offers significant learning potential when used as a supplement to the traditional teaching techniques.
4914,4,Web-Based Versus Traditional Paper Questionnaires: A Mixed-Mode Survey With a Nordic Perspective
4915,0,Survey response rates have been declining over the past decade. 
4916,0,The more widespread use of the Internet and Web-based technologies among potential health survey participants suggests that Web-based questionnaires may be an alternative to paper questionnaires in future epidemiological studies.
4917,1,A random sample of 3148 parents of Danish children aged 2-17 years were invited to participate in the Danish part of the NordChild 2011 survey on their children's health and welfare. 
4918,1,"NordChild was conducted in 1984 and 1996 in collaboration with Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden using mailed paper questionnaires only. "
4919,1,"In 2011, all countries used conventional paper versions only except Denmark where the parents were randomized into 4 groups: (1) 789 received a paper questionnaire only (paper), (2) 786 received the paper questionnaire and a log-in code to the Web-based questionnaire (paper/Web), (3) 787 received a log-in code to the Web-based questionnaire (Web), and (4) 786 received log-in details to the Web-based questionnaire and were given an incentive consisting of a chance to win a tablet computer (Web/tablet). "
4920,1,"In connection with the first reminder, the nonresponders in the paper, paper/Web, and Web groups were also present with the opportunity to win a tablet computer as a means of motivation. "
4921,1,Descriptive analysis was performed using chi-square tests. 
4922,1,Odds ratios were used to estimate differences in response rates between the 4 modes.
4923,2,"In 2011, 1704 of 3148 (54.13%) respondents answered the Danish questionnaire. "
4924,2,"The highest response rate was with the paper mode (n=443, 56.2%). "
4925,2,"The other groups had similar response rates: paper/Web (n=422, 53.7%), Web (n=420, 53.4%), and Web/tablet (n=419, 53.3%) modes. "
4926,2,"Compared to the paper mode, the odds for response rate in the paper/Web decreased by 9% (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74-1.10) and by 11% (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73-1.09) in the Web and Web/tablet modes. "
4927,2,"The total number of responders for NordChild declined from 10,291 of 15,339 (67.09%) in 1984 and 10,667 of 15,254 (69.93%) in 1996 to 7805 of 15,945 (48.95%) in 2011 with similar declines in all 5 Nordic countries."
4928,3,Web-based questionnaires could replace traditional paper questionnaires with minor effects on response rates and lower costs. 
4929,3,The increasing effect on the response rate on participants replying for a nonmonetary incentive could only be estimated within the 2 Web-based questionnaire modes before the first reminder. 
4930,3,Alternative platforms to reach higher participation rates in population surveys should reflect the development of electronic devices and the ways in which the population primarily accesses the Internet.
4931,4,Attrition Revisited: Adherence and Retention in a Web-Based Alcohol Trial
4932,0,Attrition is a noted feature of eHealth interventions and trials. 
4933,0,"In 2005, Eysenbach published a landmark paper calling for a ""science of attrition,"" suggesting that the 2 forms of attrition-nonusage attrition (low adherence to the intervention) and dropout attrition (poor retention to follow-up)-may be related and that this potential relationship deserved further study."
4934,1,Secondary analysis of data from an online trial of an online intervention to reduce alcohol consumption among heavy drinkers. 
4935,1,"The 2 outcomes were adherence to the intervention measured by number of log-ins, and retention to the trial measured by provision of follow-up data at 3 months (the primary outcome point). "
4936,1,Dependent variables were demographic and alcohol-related data collected at baseline. 
4937,1,Predictors of adherence and retention were modeled using logistic regression models.
4938,2,Data were available on 7932 participants. 
4939,2,Adherence and retention were related in a complex fashion. 
4940,2,"Participants in the intervention group were more likely than those in the control group to log in more than once (42% vs 28%, P<.001) and less likely than those in the control group to respond at 3 months (40% vs 49%, P<.001). "
4941,2,"Within each randomized group, participants who logged in more frequently were more likely to respond than those who logged in less frequently. "
4942,2,"Response rates in the intervention group for those who logged in once, twice, or >= 3 times were 34%, 46%, and 51%, respectively (P<.001); response rates in the control group for those who logged in once, twice, or >= 3 times were 44%, 60%, and 67%, respectively (P<.001). "
4943,2,Relationships between baseline characteristics and adherence and retention were also complex. 
4944,2,"Where demographic characteristics predicted adherence, they tended also to predict retention. "
4945,2,"However, characteristics related to alcohol consumption and intention or confidence in reducing alcohol consumption tended to have opposite effects on adherence and retention, with factors that predicted improved adherence tending to predict reduced retention. "
4946,2,The complexity of these relationships suggested the existence of an unmeasured confounder.
4947,3,"In this dataset, adherence and retention were related in a complex fashion. "
4948,3,We propose a possible explanatory model for these data.
4949,4,"Efficacy of Standard Versus Enhanced Features in a Web-Based Commercial Weight-Loss Program for Obese Adults, Part 2: Randomized Controlled Trial"
4950,0,"Commercial Web-based weight-loss programs are becoming more popular and increasingly refined through the addition of enhanced features, yet few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have independently and rigorously evaluated the efficacy of these commercial programs or additional features."
4951,1,"An assessor-blinded RCT comparing 301 adults (male: n=125, 41.5%; mean age: 41.9 years, SD 10.2; mean BMI: 32.2 kg/m(2), SD 3.9) who were recruited and enrolled offline, and randomly allocated to basic or enhanced versions of a commercially available Web-based weight-loss program for 24 weeks."
4952,2,"Retention at 24 weeks was greater in the enhanced group versus the basic group (basic 68.5%, enhanced 81.0%; P=.01). "
4953,2,"In the intention-to-treat analysis of covariance with imputation using last observation carried forward, after 24 weeks both intervention groups had reductions in key outcomes with no difference between groups: BMI (basic mean -1.1 kg/m(2), SD 1.5; enhanced mean -1.3 kg/m(2), SD 2.0; P=.29), weight (basic mean -3.3 kg, SD 4.7; enhanced mean -4.0 kg, SD 6.2; P=.27), waist circumference (basic mean -3.1 cm, SD 4.6; enhanced mean -4.0 cm, SD 6.2; P=.15), and waist-to-height ratio (basic mean -0.02, SD 0.03; enhanced mean -0.02, SD 0.04, P=.21). "
4954,2,"The enhanced group logged in more often at both 12 and 24 weeks, respectively (enhanced 12-week mean 34.1, SD 28.1 and 24-week mean 43.1, SD 34.0 vs basic 12-week mean 24.6, SD 25.5 and 24-week mean 31.8, SD 33.9; P=.002)."
4955,3,The addition of personalized e-feedback in the enhanced program provided limited additional benefits compared to a standard commercial Web-based weight-loss program. 
4956,3,"However, it does support greater retention in the program and greater usage, which was related to weight loss. "
4957,3,Further research is required to develop and examine Web-based features that may enhance engagement and outcomes and identify optimal usage patterns to enhance weight loss using Web-based programs.
4958,4,Predictors of Participant Retention in a Guided Online Self-Help Program for University Students: Prospective Cohort Study
4959,0,"Attrition is a persistent issue in online self-help programs, but limited research is available on reasons for attrition or successful methods for improving participant retention. "
4960,0,"One potential approach to understanding attrition and retention in such programs is to examine person-related variables (eg, beliefs and attitudes) that influence behavior. "
4961,0,"Theoretical models, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, that describe conditions influencing human behavior may provide a useful framework for predicting participant retention in online-based program."
4962,1,"65 university students with mild to moderate depression, anxiety, and stress were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. "
4963,1,Participants completed a questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior prior to commencing the online-based program and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) during the assessment module of the program. 
4964,1,Participant retention was operationalized as the number of program modules completed.
4965,2,"Perceived control over completing the online program significantly predicted intention to complete the program (F-3,F-62=6.7; P=.001; adjusted R-2=.2; standardized beta=.436, P=.001). "
4966,2,"Age (standardized beta=.319, P=.03) and perceived behavioral control (standardized beta=.295, P=.05) predicted the number of program modules completed (F-3,F-61=3.20, P=.03, adjusted R-2 =.11). "
4967,2,"Initial level of distress (ie, symptom severity) did not predict participant retention (P=.55). "
4968,2,Participants who chose phone-based coaching completed more program modules than participants who chose email-based coaching (Mann-Whitney's U=137; P=.004).
4969,3,"Participants' age, level of perceived behavioral control, and choice of interaction (ie, phone-based or email-based coaching) were found to influence retention in this online-based program."
4970,4,Internet-Based Recruitment to a Depression Prevention Intervention: Lessons From the Mood Memos Study
4971,0,Recruiting participants to randomized controlled trials of health interventions can be very difficult. 
4972,0,"Internet-based recruitment is becoming an increasingly important mode of recruitment, yet there are few detailed accounts of experiences recruiting participants to mental health interventions."
4973,1,"Participants were recruited to the Mood Memos study, an online preventive depression intervention, purely through Internet-based sources. "
4974,1,The study was targeted to adults with subthreshold depression symptoms from several English-speaking countries. 
4975,1,"A variety of online recruitment sources were trialed, including search engine advertising (Google, Yahoo!, Bing), Facebook advertising, posts in forums and online noticeboards, and promotion through relevant websites and email newsletters of mental health organizations."
4976,2,"The study website received visits from 94,808 individuals over the 14-month recruitment period. "
4977,2,The recruitment target was reached with 1699 individuals signing up to the randomized controlled trial and 1326 fully enrolling. 
4978,2,"Most visitors arrived via Google advertising, which promoted a depression-screening questionnaire. "
4979,2,"Google advertising accounted for nearly half of the total participants who signed up to the study, at an average cost of AUD $12 per participant. "
4980,2,Promoting the study through trustworthy organizations and websites known to participants was also effective. 
4981,2,"Recruitment techniques that were less effective were contacting forums, email groups, and community noticeboards."
4982,3,"Several techniques, including Google advertising, were successful in recruiting participants to a trial evaluating an online depression intervention. "
4983,4,Health Professional Learner Attitudes and Use of Digital Learning Resources
4984,0,"Web-based digital repositories allow educational resources to be accessed efficiently and conveniently from diverse geographic locations, hold a variety of resource formats, enable interactive learning, and facilitate targeted access for the user. "
4985,0,"Unlike some other learning management systems (LMS), resources can be retrieved through search engines and meta-tagged labels, and content can be streamed, which is particularly useful for multimedia resources."
4986,1,"The following data were examined using an audit of the repository server: (1) number of online resources accessed per day in 2010, (2) number of each type of resource accessed, (3) number of resources accessed during business hours (9 am to 5 pm) and outside business hours (years 1-4), (4) session length of each log-on (years 1-4), and (5) video quality (bit rate) of each video accessed. "
4987,1,An online questionnaire and 3 focus groups assessed student feedback and self-reported experiences of Physeek.
4988,2,Students preferred the support provided by Physeek to other sources of educational material primarily because of its efficiency. 
4989,2,"Peak usage commonly occurred at times of increased academic need (ie, examination times). "
4990,2,Students perceived online repositories as a potential tool to support lifelong learning and health care delivery.
4991,3,The results of this study indicate that today's health professional students welcome the benefits of online learning resources because of their convenience and usability. 
4992,3,This represents a transition away from traditional learning styles and toward technological learning support and may indicate a growing link between social immersions in Internet-based connections and learning styles. 
4993,3,The true potential for Web-based resources to support student learning is as yet unknown. 
4994,4,Conducting Research on the Internet: Medical Record Data Integration with Patient-Reported Outcomes
4995,0,"The growth in the number of patients seeking health information online has given rise to new direct-to-patient research methods, including direct patient recruitment and study conduct without use of physician sites. "
4996,0,"While such patient-centric designs offer time and cost efficiencies, the absence of physician-reported data is a key concern, with potential impact on both scientific rigor and operational feasibility."
4997,1,We invited a random sample of MediGuard.org members aged 18 to 80 years to participate via email based on a gout treatment or diagnosis in their online profiles. 
4998,1,"Interested members clicked on an email link to access study information, consent to participate electronically, and be screened for eligibility. "
4999,1,The first 50 consenting participants completed an online survey and provided electronic and wet signatures on medical record release forms for us to obtain medical charts from their managing physicians.
5000,2,A total of 108 of 1250 MediGuard.org members (8.64%) accessed study information before we closed the study at 50 completed surveys. 
5001,2,"Of these 108 members who took the screener, 50 (46.3%) completed the study, 19 (17.6%) did not pass the screening, 5 (4.6%) explicitly declined to participate due to the medical record requirement, and 34 (31.5%) closed the browser without completing the survey screener. "
5002,2,"Ultimately, we obtained 38 of 50 charts (76%): 28 collected using electronic signature and 10 collected based on wet signature on a paper form. "
5003,2,"Of the 38 charts, 37 cited a gout diagnosis (35 charts) or use of a gout medication (2 charts). "
5004,2,Only 1 chart lacked any mention of gout.
5005,3,Patients can be recruited directly for observational study designs that include patient-reported outcomes and medical record data with over 75% data completeness. 
5006,3,"Although the validity of self-reported diagnosis is often a concern in Internet-based studies, in this PRO+MR study pilot, nearly all (37 of 38) charts confirmed patient-reported data. "
5007,4,The Umea University Database of Facial Expressions: A Validation Study
5008,0,"A set of face stimuli, called the Umea University Database of Facial Expressions, is described. "
5009,0,"The set consists of 30 female and 30 male models aged 17-67 years (M = 30.19, SD = 10.66). "
5010,0,"Each model shows seven different facial expressions (angry, surprised, happy, sad, neutral, afraid, and disgusted). "
5011,0,"Most models are ethnic Swedes but models of Central European, Arabic, and Asian origin are also included."
5012,1,"The images, presented in random order one at a time, were validated by 526 volunteers rating on average 125 images on seven 10-point Likert-type scales ranging from ""completely disagree"" to ""completely agree"" for each emotion."
5013,2,The proportion of the aggregated results that were correctly classified was considered to be high (M = 88%).
5014,3,The results lend empirical support for the validity of this set of facial expressions. 
5015,3,The set can be used freely by the scientific community. 
5016,4,Parent Opinions About Use of Text Messaging for Immunization Reminders
5017,0,Adherence to childhood immunization schedules is a function of various factors. 
5018,0,"Given the increased use of technology as a strategy to increase immunization coverage, it is important to investigate how parents perceive different forms of communication, including traditional means and text-message reminders."
5019,1,Structured interviews were developed and approved by two Institutional Review Boards. 
5020,1,A convenience sample of 50 parents was recruited from two local pediatric clinics. 
5021,1,"The study included a demographics questionnaire, the shortened form of the Test of Functional Health Literacy for Adults (S-TOFHLA), questions regarding benefits and barriers of text communication from immunization providers, and preferred content for immunization reminders. "
5022,1,"Content analyses were performed on responses to barriers, benefits, and preferred content (all Cohen's kappas > 0.70)."
5023,2,"Respondents were mostly female (45/50, 90%), white non-Hispanic (31/50, 62%), between 20-41 years (mean = 29, SD 5), with one or two children (range 1-9). "
5024,2,"Nearly all (48/50, 96%) had an S-TOFHLA score in the ""adequate"" range. "
5025,2,"All parents (50/50, 100%) engaged in face-to-face contact with their child's physician at appointments, 74% (37/50) had contact via telephone, and none of the parents (0/50, 0%) used email or text messages. "
5026,2,"Most parents were satisfied with the face-to-face (48/50, 96%) and telephone (28/50, 75%) communication. "
5027,2,"Forty-nine of the 50 participants (98%) were interested in receiving immunization reminders by text message, and all parents (50/50, 100%) were willing to receive general appointment reminders by text message. "
5028,2,Parents made 200 comments regarding text-message reminders. 
5029,2,Benefits accounted for 63.5% of comments (127/200). 
5030,2,"The remaining 37.5% (73/200) regarded barriers; however, no barriers could be identified by 26% of participants (13/50). "
5031,2,Parents made 172 comments regarding preferred content of text-message immunization reminders. 
5032,2,"The most frequently discussed topics were date due (50/172, 29%), general reminder (26/172, 26%), and child's name (21/172, 12%)."
5033,3,"Most parents were satisfied with traditional communication; however, few had experienced any alternative forms of communication regarding immunizations. "
5034,3,Benefits of receiving text messages for immunization reminders far outweighed the barriers identified by parents. 
5035,3,Few barriers identified were text specific. 
5036,3,"Those that were, centered on cost if parents did not have unlimited texting plans."
5037,4,"Internet-Based HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Testing in British Columbia, Canada: Opinions and Expectations of Prospective Clients"
5038,0,"The feasibility and acceptability of Internet-based sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing have been demonstrated; however, few programs have included testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). "
5039,0,"In British Columbia, Canada, a new initiative will offer online access to chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV testing, integrated with existing clinic-based services. "
5040,0,We presented the model to gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and existing clinic clients through a series of focus groups.
5041,1,"Participants were recruited through email invitations, online classifieds, and flyers in STI clinics. "
5042,1,A structured interview guide was used. 
5043,1,"Focus groups were audio recorded, and an observer took detailed field notes. "
5044,1,Analysts then listened to audio recordings to validate field notes. 
5045,1,Data were coded and analyzed using a scissor-and-sort technique.
5046,2,"In total, 39 people participated in six focus groups. "
5047,2,"Most were MSM, and all were active Internet users and experienced with STI/HIV testing. "
5048,2,"Perceived benefits of Internet-based STI testing included anonymity, convenience, and client-centered control. "
5049,2,"Salient concerns were reluctance to provide personal information online, distrust of security of data provided online, and the need for comprehensive pretest information and support for those receiving positive results, particularly for HIV. "
5050,2,"Suggestions emerged for mitigation of these concerns: provide up-front and detailed information about the model, ask only the minimal information required for testing, give positive results only by phone or in person, and ensure that those testing positive are referred for counseling and support. "
5051,2,"End users expected Internet testing to offer continuous online service delivery, from booking appointments, to transmitting information to the laboratory, to getting prescriptions. "
5052,2,Most participants said they would use the service or recommend it to others. 
5053,2,Those who indicated they would be unlikely to use it generally either lived near an STI clinic or routinely saw a family doctor with whom they were comfortable testing. 
5054,2,"Participants expected that the service would provide the greatest benefit to individuals who do not already have access to sensitive sexual health services, are reluctant to test due to stigma, or want to take immediate action (eg, because of a recent potential STI/HIV exposure)."
5055,3,"Internet-based STI/HIV testing has the potential to reduce barriers to testing, as a complement to existing clinic-based services. "
5056,3,"Trust in the new online service, however, is a prerequisite to client uptake and may be engendered by transparency of information about the model, and by accounting for concerns related to confidentiality, data usage, and provision of positive (especially HIV) results. "
5057,3,Ongoing evaluation of this new model will be essential to its success and to the confidence of its users.
5058,4,The Influence of User Characteristics and a Periodic Email Prompt on Exposure to an Internet-Delivered Computer-Tailored Lifestyle Program
5059,0,The Internet is a promising medium in the field of health promotion for offering tailored and targeted lifestyle interventions applying computer-tailored (CT) techniques to the general public. 
5060,0,"Actual exposure to CT interventions is not living up to its high expectations, as only a (limited) proportion of the target group is actually using these programs."
5061,1,"The research population for this study consisted of Dutch adults participating in the Adult Health Monitor, offered by the regional public health services. "
5062,1,"We used a randomized controlled trial design to assess predictors of first use, prolonged use, and sustained use. "
5063,1,"Demographics and behavioral characteristics, as well as the strategy used for revisiting, were included as predictors in the model."
5064,2,A total of 9169 participants indicated their interest in the new program and 5168 actually logged in to the program. 
5065,2,"Participants significantly more likely to initiate one of the CT modules were male, older, and employed, and had a lower income, higher body mass index, and relatively unhealthy lifestyle. "
5066,2,Participants significantly more likely to complete one of the CT modules were older and had a higher income and a relatively healthier lifestyle. 
5067,2,"Finally, using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65-78.52; P < .001)."
5068,3,"Older, male, and employed participants, and those with a lower income, higher body mass index, and a relatively unhealthy lifestyle were more likely to initiate a CT module. "
5069,3,Module completers predominantly had a higher income and age. 
5070,3,The current program therefore succeeded in reaching those people who benefit most from online lifestyle interventions. 
5071,3,"However, these people tended to disengage from the program. "
5072,3,This underlines the importance of additional research into program adjustments and strategies that can be used to stimulate prolonged program use. 
5073,3,"Furthermore, sending periodic email prompts significantly increased revisits to the program. "
5074,3,"Though promising, this effect was modest and needs to be further examined, in order to maximize the potential of periodic email prompting."
5075,1,The decomposed technology acceptance model was applied to construct the research model on which the hypotheses were based. 
5076,1,"A questionnaire was developed based on the model and data from nurses (n = 388) were collected from late January 2009 until April 30, 2009. "
5077,1,Pearson's correlation analysis and t tests were used for data analysis.
5078,2,"Intention toward using Web 2.0 tools was positively correlated with usage behavior (r = .60, P < .05). "
5079,2,"Behavioral intention was positively correlated with attitude (r = .72, P < .05), perceived behavioral control (r = .58, P < .05), and subjective norm (r = .45, P < .05). "
5080,2,"In their decomposed constructs, perceived usefulness (r = .7, P < .05), relative advantage (r = .64, P < .05), and compatibility (r = .60, P < .05) were positively correlated with attitude, but perceived ease of use was not significantly correlated (r = .004, P < .05) with it. "
5081,2,"Peer (r = .47, P < .05), senior management (r = .24, P < .05), and hospital (r = .45, P < .05) influences had positive correlations with subjective norm. "
5082,2,"Resource (r = .41, P < .05) and technological (r = .69, P < .05) conditions were positively correlated with perceived behavioral control."
5083,3,"The identified behavioral perceptions may further health policy makers' understanding of nurses' concerns regarding and barriers to the adoption of Web 2.0 tools and enable them to better plan the strategy of implementation of Web 2.0 tools for knowledge sharing, learning, social interaction, and the production of collective intelligence."
5084,4,Improving Access to Information and Support for Patients With Less Common Cancers: Hematologic Cancer Patients Views About Web-Based Approaches
5085,0,Meeting the psychosocial needs of vulnerable groups such as cancer survivors remains an ongoing challenge. 
5086,0,This is particularly so for those who have less access to the usual forms of medical specialist and in-person support networks. 
5087,0,Internet-based approaches offer an opportunity to better meet patients' information and support needs by overcoming the barrier of geographic isolation.
5088,2,"The majority of participants (186/254, 73.2%) reported a high level of access to the Internet, with higher Internet access associated with a higher level of education, larger household, younger age, and being married or employed. "
5089,2,"A total of 62.2% (156/251) of survivors indicated they were likely to use the Internet for accessing information, with the percentage much lower (69/251, 28%) for accessing support via the Internet. "
5090,2,Likelihood of using the Internet for support was associated with feeling anxious and being employed.
5091,3,"While the Internet appears to offer promise in increasing equitable access to information and support for cancer survivors for both metropolitan and regional areas, it is viewed less favorably for support and by particular subgroups (eg, older people and those without a university degree) within the survivor population. "
5092,3,Promoting greater understanding of this mode of support may be required to achieve its potential. 
5093,3,Information and support options other than Web-based approaches may continue to be needed by vulnerable groups of cancer survivors.
5094,4,"Cool but Counterproductive: Interactive, Web-Based Risk Communications Can Backfire"
5095,0,Paper-based patient decision aids generally present risk information using numbers and/or static images. 
5096,0,"However, limited psychological research has suggested that when people interactively graph risk information, they process the statistics more actively, making the information more available for decision making. "
5097,0,Such interactive tools could potentially be incorporated in a new generation of Web-based decision aids.
5098,1,A total of 3371 members of a demographically diverse Internet panel viewed a hypothetical scenario about two hypothetical treatments for thyroid cancer. 
5099,1,"Each treatment had a chance of causing 1 of 2 side effects, but we randomly varied whether one treatment was better on both dimensions (strong dominance condition), slightly better on only one dimension (mild dominance condition), or better on one dimension but worse on the other (trade-off condition) than the other treatment. "
5100,1,"We also varied whether respondents passively viewed the risk information in static pictograph (icon array) images or actively manipulated the information by using interactive Flash-based animations of ""fill-in-the-blank"" pictographs. "
5101,1,Our primary hypothesis was that active manipulation would increase respondents' ability to recognize dominance (when available) and choose the better treatment.
5102,2,"The interactive risk graphic conditions had significantly worse survey completion rates (1110/1695, 65.5% vs 1316/1659, 79.3%, P < .001) than the static image conditions. "
5103,2,"In addition, respondents using interactive graphs were less likely to recognize and select the dominant treatment option (234/380, 61.6% vs 343/465, 73.8%, P < .001 in the strong dominance condition)."
5104,3,"Interactivity, however visually appealing, can both add to respondent burden and distract people from understanding relevant statistical information. "
5105,3,Decision-aid developers need to be aware that interactive risk presentations may create worse outcomes than presentations of static risk graphic formats.
5106,4,Effects of a Multilingual Information Website Intervention on the Levels of Depression Literacy and Depression-Related Stigma in Greek-Born and Italian-Born Immigrants Living in Australia: A Randomized Controlled Trial
5107,0,Little is known about the efficacy of Internet-based information interventions in increasing depression literacy or reducing depression stigma and depressive symptoms in people from non-English-speaking backgrounds.
5108,2,"For depression literacy, there was a significant difference between the MIDonline and the control group with those in the MIDonline intervention displaying higher depression literacy scores postassessment (F-1,F-178 = 144.99, P < .001) and at the follow-up assessment (F-1,F-178 = 129.13, P < .001) than those in the control group. "
5109,2,"In addition, those in the MIDonline intervention showed a significantly greater decrease in mean personal stigma scores postassessment (F-1,F-178 = 38.75, P < .001) and at the follow-up assessment (F-1,F-176 = 11.08, P = .001) than those in the control group. "
5110,2,"For perceived stigma, there was no significant difference between the MIDonline intervention and the control group at postassessment (F-1,F-178 = 0.60, P = .44) and at the follow-up assessment (F-1,F-176 = 1.06, P = .30). "
5111,2,"For level of depression, there was no significant difference between the MIDonline intervention and the control group at preassessment (F-1,F-201 = 0.56, P = .45), postassessment (F-1,F-178 = 0.03, P = .86), or at the follow-up assessment, (F-1,F-175 = 1.71, P = .19). "
5112,2,"Within group effect sizes for depression literacy were -1.78 (MIDonline) and -0.07 (control); for personal stigma, they were 0.83 (MIDonline) and 0.06 (control); for perceived stigma, they were 0.14 (MIDonline) and 0.16 (control); and for depressive symptoms, they were 0.10 (MIDonline) and 0.10 (control)."
5113,3,Current results suggested that the Internet may be a feasible and effective means for increasing depression knowledge and decreasing personal stigma in non-English-speaking immigrant populations residing in English-speaking countries. 
5114,3,The lack of change in perceived stigma in this trial is consistent with results in other trials examining online depression stigma interventions in English-speaking groups.
5115,4,Parent Satisfaction With the Electronic Medical Record in an Academic Pediatric Rheumatology Practice
5116,0,Patient satisfaction has not been widely studied with respect to implementation of the electronic medical record (EMR). 
5117,0,There are few reports of the impact of the EMR in pediatrics.
5118,1,Families were surveyed 1 month pre-EMR implementation and 3 months post-EMR implementation.
5119,2,"Overall, EMR was well received by families. "
5120,2,"Compared with the paper chart, parents agreed the EMR improved the quality of doctor care (55% or 59/107 vs 26% or 26/99, P < .001). "
5121,2,"More parents indicated they would prefer their pediatric physicians to use an EMR (68% or 73/107 vs 51% or 50/99, P = .01)."
5122,3,Transitioning an academic pediatric rheumatology practice to an EMR can increase family satisfaction with the office visit.
5123,4,Consumers Perceptions About and Use of the Internet for Personal Health Records and Health Information Exchange: Analysis of the 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey
5124,0,Personal health records (PHRs) and the sharing of health information through health information exchange (HIE) have been advocated as key new components in the effective delivery of modern health care. 
5125,0,It is important to understand consumer attitudes toward utilization of PHRs and HIE to evaluate the public's willingness to adopt these new health care tools.
5126,1,"Analysis of data from the 2007 iteration of the Health Information National Trends Study (HINTS, N = 7674) was conducted using multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of consumer (1) appraisal of PHRs, (2) appraisal of health care provider use of HIE, and (3) use of the Internet for tracking PHRs."
5127,2,: Approximately 86% of US adults rated electronic access to their PHRs as important. 
5128,2,"However, only 9% of them used the Internet for tracking PHRs. "
5129,2,"Those who rated electronic access to their PHRs as important were more likely to be Hispanic (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.72) and Internet users (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.02-1.57) and less likely to be age 65 and above (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.38-0.67) or individuals whose doctors always ensured their understanding of their health (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.49-0.78). "
5130,2,"Those who rated HIE as important were more likely to be 45 to 54 years of age (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.03-2.08), 55 to 64 years of age (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.32-2.53), or 65 and above (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.27-2.43) and less likely to be women (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.68-0.95) or individuals who perceive their health information as not safely guarded by their doctors (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.40-0.69). "
5131,2,"Among Internet users, those who used the Internet to track their PHRs were more likely to be college graduates (OR = 1.84, 95% = 1.32-2.59) or to have completed some college courses (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.02-2.11), to be Hispanic (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.23-2.98), or to be individuals with health care provider access (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.21-2.97). "
5132,2,"Women were less likely to use the Internet for tracking PHRs than men (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.61-1.00)."
5133,3,"Despite widespread positive appraisal of electronic access to PHRs as important, Internet use for tracking PHRs remains uncommon. "
5134,3,"To promote PHR adoption, the digital divide associated with the gap in health literacy must be improved, and cultural issues and the doctor-patient relationship need to be studied. "
5135,3,Further work also needs to address consumer concerns regarding the security of HIE.
5136,4,An International Comparison of Web-based Reporting About Health Care Quality: Content Analysis
5137,0,"On more and more websites, consumers are provided with public reports about health care. "
5138,0,This move toward provision of more comparative information has resulted in different information types being published that often contain contradictory information.
5139,1,A Web search was used to identify websites that contained comparative health care information. 
5140,1,"The websites were systematically examined to assess how three different types of information (provider characteristics and services, performance indicators, and health care user experience) were presented to consumers. "
5141,1,"Furthermore, a short survey was disseminated to the reviewed websites to assess how the presentation formats were selected."
5142,2,"We reviewed 42 websites from the following countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Sweden. "
5143,2,We found the most common ways to integrate different information types were the two extreme options: no integration at all (on 36% of the websites) and high levels of integration in single tables on 41% of the websites). 
5144,2,Nearly 70% of the websites offered drill down paths to more detailed information. 
5145,2,Diverse presentation approaches were used to display comparative health care information on the Internet. 
5146,2,Numbers were used on the majority of websites (88%) to display comparative information.
5147,3,"Currently, approaches to the presentation of comparative health care information do not seem to be systematically selected. "
5148,3,"It seems important, however, that website managers become aware of the complexities inherent in comparative information when they release information on the Web. "
5149,3,"Important complexities to pay attention to are the use of numbers, the display of contradictory information, and the extent of variation among attributes and attribute levels. "
5150,3,"As for the integration of different information types, it remains unclear which presentation approaches are preferable. "
5151,3,Our study provides a good starting point for Internet research to further address the question of how different types of information can be more effectively presented to consumers.
5152,4,Mobile Therapy: Case Study Evaluations of a Cell Phone Application for Emotional Self-Awareness
5153,0,Emotional awareness and self-regulation are important skills for improving mental health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. 
5154,0,Cognitive behavioral therapy can teach these skills but is not widely available.
5155,1,"We developed a mobile phone application with touch screen scales for mood reporting and therapeutic exercises for cognitive reappraisal (ie, examination of maladaptive interpretations) and physical relaxation. "
5156,1,The application was deployed in a one-month field study with eight individuals who had reported significant stress during an employee health assessment. 
5157,1,Participants were prompted via their mobile phones to report their moods several times a day on a Mood Map a translation of the circumplex model of emotion and a series of single-dimension mood scales. 
5158,1,"Using the prototype, participants could also activate mobile therapies as needed. "
5159,1,"During weekly open-ended interviews, participants discussed their use of the device and responded to longitudinal views of their data. "
5160,1,"Analyses included a thematic review of interview narratives, assessment of mood changes over the course of the study and the diurnal cycle, and interrogation of this mobile data based on stressful incidents reported in interviews."
5161,2,Five case studies illustrate participants' use of the mobile phone application to increase self-awareness and to cope with stress. 
5162,2,One example is a participant who had been coping with longstanding marital conflict. 
5163,2,"After reflecting on his mood data, particularly a drop in energy each evening, the participant began practicing relaxation therapies on the phone before entering his house, applying cognitive reappraisal techniques to cope with stressful family interactions, and talking more openly with his wife. "
5164,2,"His mean anger, anxiety and sadness ratings all were lower in the second half of the field study than in the first (P <=.01 for all three scales). "
5165,2,"Similar changes were observed among other participants as they used the application to negotiate bureaucratic frustrations, work tensions and personal relationships. "
5166,2,Participants appeared to understand the mood scales developed for this experience sampling application and responded to them in a way that was generally consistent with self-reflection in weekly interviews. 
5167,2,"Interview accounts of mood changes, associated with diurnal cycles, personal improvement over the course of the study, and stressful episodes, could be seen in the experience sampling data. "
5168,2,Discrepancies between interview and experience-sampling data highlighted the ways that individuals responded to the two forms of inquiry and how they calibrated mood ratings over the course of the study.
5169,3,"Participants quickly grasped the Mood Mapping and therapeutic concepts, and applied them creatively in order to help themselves and empathize with others. "
5170,3,Applications developed for mobile phones hold promise for delivering state-of-the-art psychotherapies in a nonstigmatizing fashion to many people who otherwise would not have access to therapy.
5171,4,"Effectiveness of Active-Online, an Individually Tailored Physical Activity Intervention, in a Real-Life Setting: Randomized Controlled Trial"
5172,0,Effective interventions are needed to reduce the chronic disease epidemic. 
5173,0,The Internet has the potential to provide large populations with individual advice at relatively low cost.
5174,1,Volunteers recruited via different media channels completed a Web-based baseline survey and were randomized to Active-online (intervention group) or a nontailored website (control group). 
5175,1,"In addition, spontaneous users were recruited directly from the Active-online website. "
5176,1,"In a subgroup of participants, physical activity was measured objectively using accelerometers. "
5177,1,"Follow-up assessments took place 6 weeks (FU1), 6 months (FU2), and 13 months (FU3) after baseline."
5178,2,"A total of 1531 respondents completed the baseline questionnaire (intervention group n = 68 1, control group 11 = 688, spontaneous users n = 162); 133 individuals had valid accelerometer data at baseline. "
5179,2,"Mean age of the total sample was 43.7 years, and 1146 (74.9%) were women. "
5180,2,"Mixed linear models (adjusted for sex, age, BMI category, and stage of change) showed a significant increase in self-reported mean minutes spent in moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity from baseline to FU1 (coefficient = 0.14, P = .001) and to FU3 (coefficient = 0.19, P < .001) in all participants with no significant differences between groups. "
5181,2,"A significant increase in the proportion of individuals meeting the HEPA recommendations (self-reported) was observed in all participants between baseline and FU3 (OR = 1.47, P = .03), with a higher increase in spontaneous users compared to the randomized groups (interaction between FU3 and spontaneous users, OR = 2,95, P = .02). "
5182,2,There were no increases in physical activity over time in any group for objectively measured physical activity. 
5183,2,"A significant relation was found between time spent on the tailored intervention and changes in self-reported physical activity between baseline and FU3 (coefficient = 1.13, P = .03, intervention group and spontaneous users combined). "
5184,2,"However, this association was no longer significant when adjusting for stage of change."
5185,3,"In a real-life setting, Active-online was not more effective than a nontailored website in increasing physical activity levels in volunteers from the general population. "
5186,3,"Further research may investigate ways of integrating Web-based physical activity interventions in a wider context, for example, primary care or workplace health promotion."
5187,4,Evaluation of Internet-Based Technology for Supporting Self-Care: Problems Encountered by Patients and Caregivers When Using Self-Care Applications
5188,0,Prior studies have shown that many patients are interested in Internet-based technology that enables them to control their own care. 
5189,0,"As a result, innovative eHealth services are evolving rapidly, including self-assessment tools and secure patient-caregiver email communication. "
5190,0,It is interesting to explore how these technologies can be used for supporting self-care.
5191,1,We conducted scenario-based tests combined with in-depth interviews among 14 caregivers and 14 patients/consumers to describe the use of various self-care applications and the accompanying user problems. 
5192,1,"We focused on the user-friendliness of the applications, the quality of care provided by the applications, and the implementation of the applications in practice."
5193,2,Problems with the user-friendliness of the self care applications concerned inadequate navigation structures and search options and lack of feedback features. 
5194,2,"Patients want to retrieve health information with as little effort as possible; however, the navigation and search functionalities of the applications appeared incapable of handling patients' health complaints efficiently. "
5195,2,"Among caregivers, the lack of feedback and documentation possibilities caused inconvenience. "
5196,2,"Caregivers wanted to know how patients acted on their advice, but the applications did not offer an adequate feedback feature. "
5197,2,Quality of care problems were mainly related to insufficient tailoring of information to patients' needs and to efficiency problems. 
5198,2,"Patients expected personalized advice to control their state of health, but the applications failed to deliver this. "
5199,2,Language (semantics) also appeared as an obstacle to providing appropriate and useful self-care advice. 
5200,2,Caregivers doubted the reliability of the computer-generated information and the efficiency and effectiveness of secure email consultation. 
5201,2,Legal or ethical issues with respect to possible misuse of email consultation also caused concerns. 
5202,2,Implementation problems were mainly experienced by caregivers due to unclear policy on email consultation and the lack of training for email consultations.
5203,3,Patients' and caregivers' expectations did not correspond with their experiences of the use of the Internet-based applications for self-care. 
5204,3,Patients thought that the applications would support them in solving their health problems. 
5205,3,Caregivers were more reserved about the applications because of medico-legal concerns about misuse. 
5206,3,"However, the applications failed to support self-care because eHealth is more than just a technological intervention. "
5207,3,The design of the applications should include a way of thinking about how to deliver health care with the aid of technology. 
5208,3,"The most powerful application for self-care was secure email consultation, combined with a suitable triage mechanism to empower patients' self-awareness. "
5209,3,Future research should focus on the effectiveness of such Web-based triage mechanisms for medical complaints and on the development of interactive features to enhance patients' self-care.
5210,1,A survey of developers working on biomedical OS projects was conducted to examine the QA activities that are performed. 
5211,1,We took a descriptive approach to summarize the implementation of QA activities and then examined some of the factors that may be related to the implementation of such practices.
5212,2,"Our descriptive results show that 63% (95% CI, 54-72) of projects did not include peer reviews in their development process, while 82% (95% CI, 75-89) did include testing. "
5213,2,"Approximately 74% (95% CI, 67-81) of developers did not have a background in computing, 80% (95% CI, 74-87) were paid for their contributions to the project, and 52% (95% CI, 43-60) had PhDs. "
5214,2,"A multivariate logistic regression model to predict the implementation of peer reviews was not significant (likelihood ratio test = 16.86, 9 df, P=.051) and neither was a model to predict the implementation of testing (likelihood ratio test = 3.34, 9 df, P=.95)."
5215,3,Less attention is paid to peer review than testing. 
5216,3,"However, the former is a complementary, and necessary, QA practice rather than an alternative. "
5217,3,"Therefore, one can argue that there are quality risks, at least at this point in time, in transitioning biomedical OS software into any critical settings that may have operational, financial, or safety implications. "
5218,3,Developers of biomedical OS applications should invest more effort in implementing systemic peer review practices throughout the development and maintenance processes.
5219,1,"We examined measures of participant exposure to either an Enhanced condition Web-based program (interactive, tailored, and rich-media program) or a Basic condition control website (static, text-based material). "
5220,1,"Specific measures focused on email prompting, participant visits (number, duration, and pattern of use over time), and Web page viewing (number of views, types of pages viewed, and Web forum postings)."
5221,2,Participants in the ChewFree.com Enhanced condition made more visits and spent more time accessing their assigned website than did participants assigned to the Basic condition website. 
5222,2,"In addition, exposure data demonstrated that Basic condition users thoroughly accessed program content, indicating that the condition provided a meaningful, face-valid control to the Enhanced condition."
5223,3,We recommend that researchers conducting evaluations of Web-based interventions consider the collection and analysis of exposure measures in the broader context of program engagement in order to assess whether participants obtain sufficient exposure to relevant program content.
5224,4,Experience and attitudes towards information technology among first-year medical students in Denmark: Longitudinal questionnaire survey
5225,0,"As more and more information technology (IT) resources become available both for support of campus- based medical education and for Web-based learning, it becomes increasingly interesting to map the information technology resources available to medical students and the attitudes students have towards their use."
5226,1,"In the period from 1998 to 2002, students beginning the first semester of medical school were given courses on effective use of IT in their studies. "
5227,1,"As a part of the tutorials, the students were asked to complete a web-based questionnaire which included questions related to IT readiness and attitudes towards using IT in studies."
5228,2,A total of 1159 students (78%) responded. 
5229,2,"Overall, 71.7% of the respondents indicating they had access to a computer at home, a number that did not change significantly during the study period. "
5230,2,"Over time, the power of students' computers and the use of e-mail and Internet did increase significantly. "
5231,2,"By fall 2002, approximately 90% of students used e-mail regularly, 80 % used the Internet regularly, and 60 % had access to the Internet from home. "
5232,2,"Significantly more males than females had access to a computer at home, and males had a more positive attitude towards the use of computers in their medical studies. "
5233,2,A fairly constant number of students (3-7 %) stated that they would prefer not to have to use computers in their studies.
5234,3,"Taken together with our experience from classroom teaching, these results indicate optional teaching of basic information technology still needs to be integrated into medical studies, and that this need does not seem likely to disappear in the near future."
5235,4,Use of the Internet in Scanning the Horizon for New and Emerging Health Technologies: A Survey of Agencies Involved in Horizon Scanning
5236,0,A number of countries worldwide have structured horizon scanning systems which provide timely information on the impact of new health technologies to decision makers in health care. 
5237,0,"In general, the agencies that are responsible for horizon scanning have limited resources in terms of budget and staff. "
5238,0,"In contrast, the number of new and emerging health technologies, i.e. "
5239,0,"pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical and surgical procedures, is growing rapidly. "
5240,0,This requires the Horizon Scanning Systems (HSSs) to devise efficient procedures for identification of new health technologies. 
5241,0,The role of the Internet for this purpose has as yet not been documented.
5242,1,A questionnaire was developed and distributed among 10 agencies known to work within this specific area. 
5243,1,"The questionnaire specifically focussed on type of sites scanned, frequency of scanning, and importance of a site for the identification of a new health technology."
5244,2,A 100% response rate was obtained. 
5245,2,"Seven out of 10 agencies used the Internet to systematically identify new health technologies, of which 6 provided complete information. "
5246,2,A total of 110 web sites were scanned by these 6 agencies. 
5247,2,The number of sites scanned per agency ranged from 11 to 27. 
5248,2,Most sites were scanned weekly (41%) or monthly (33%). 
5249,2,Thirty-one percent (31%) of the total number of sites was considered as highly important. 
5250,2,The agencies spent at least 2 hours a week and at most 8 hours per week scanning the Internet. 
5251,2,"Although each agency's remit differed somewhat in scope, on average the same types of sites were scanned. "
5252,2,"These include sites from regulatory agencies, sites with information on new drugs or new devices, and sites with news from newswires. "
5253,2,"However, within these types there was not much correlation between the individual sites that agencies judged important to scan."
5254,3,The use of the Internet for identifying new health technologies is increasing in the majority of horizon scanning systems around the world. 
5255,3,At the same time there is considerable variation between individual agencies in their approach to this source of information. 
5256,3,This can only be partially explained by differences in scope of scanning activities of the individual agencies. 
5257,3,A coordinated effort to develop Internet search strategies for either different categories of health technologies or different clinical specialties may improve efficiency and quality of scanning in terms of the number of potentially relevant technologies identified.
5258,4,eEurope 2002: Quality Criteria for Health related Websites
5259,0,"A number of organisations have begun to provide specific tools for searching, rating, and grading this information, while others have set up codes of conduct by which site providers can attest to their high quality services. "
5260,0,The aim of such tools is to assist individuals to sift through the mountains of information available so as to be better able to discern valid and reliable messages from those which are misleading or inaccurate.
5261,1,"A meeting was held during 2001 which drew together key players from Government departments, International Organisations, non-governmental organisations and industry, to explore current practices and experiments in this field. "
5262,1,"Some sixty invited participants from all the Member States, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States of America took part in the meeting of June 7-8, 2001: they included delegates from industrial, medical, and patient interest groups, delegates from Member States' governments, and key invited speakers from the field of health information ethics. "
5263,1,"These individuals, and many others, also took part in the web-based consultation which was open from august to November 2001."
5264,2,"The broad headings for quality criteria identified include Transparency and Honesty, Authority, Privacy and data protection, Updating of information, Accountability, Responsible partnering, Editorial policy, Accessibility, the latter includes attention to guidelines on physical accessibility as well as general findability, searchability, readability, usability, etc. "
5265,2,A metadata labelling system may be used to make health data more findable. 
5266,2,Such a system may also be used in conjunction with quality criteria to give higher ranking by search engines to those sites or pages labelled as complying with defined quality criteria.
5267,3,"The set of quality criteria is based upon a broad consensus among specialists in this field, health authorities, and prospective users. "
5268,3,"It is now to be expected that national and regional health authorities, relevant professional associations, and private medical website owners will 1) implement the Quality Criteria for Health Related Websites in a manner appropriate to their website and consumers; 2) develop information campaigns to educate site developers and citizens about minimum quality standards for health related websites; 3) draw on the wide range of health information offered across the European Union and localise such information for the benefit of citizens (translation and cultural adaptation); 4) exchange information and experience at European level about how quality standards are being implemented."
5269,4,The Degree of Anxiety and Depression in Patients With Cardiovascular Diseases as Assessed Using a Mobile App: Cross-Sectional Study
5270,0,Depression and anxiety are common comorbidities in cardiovascular clinic outpatients. 
5271,0,"Timely identification and intervention of these mental and psychological disorders can contribute to correct diagnosis, better prognosis, less medical expenses, and improved quality of life. "
5272,0,The convenience of online doctor-patient communication platforms has increasingly attracted patients to online consultations. 
5273,0,"However, online health care and offline health care are very different. "
5274,0,Research on how to identify psychological disorders in patients who engage in an online cardiology consultation is lacking.
5275,1,"From June 2022 to July 2022, we conducted follow-up visits with 10,173 patients on the Haodf platform. "
5276,1,We conducted detailed consultations with 286 patients who visited the same cardiologist in the outpatient department. 
5277,1,"We used the self-rated Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scales to assess anxiety and depression, respectively. "
5278,1,We analyzed the influencing factors related to the degree of coordination of online patients. 
5279,1,We also compared the prevalence of anxiety or depression between online and offline patients and analyzed the factors related to anxiety or depression.
5280,2,"Of the 10,173 online consultation patients, only 186 (1.8%) responded effectively. "
5281,2,The response rate of the offline consultation patients was 96.5% (276/286). 
5282,2,Frequent online communication and watching live video broadcasts were significantly related to effective responses from online patients (P<.001). 
5283,2,"The prevalence of anxiety (70/160, 43.7% vs 69/266, 25.8%; P<.001) or depression (78/160, 48.7% vs 74/266, 27.7%; P<.001) in online consultation patients was significantly higher than that in offline patients. "
5284,2,"In bivariate analyses, the factors related to anxiety included female sex, unemployment, no confirmed cardiovascular disease, and the online consultation mode, while smokers and those who underwent COVID-19 quarantine were less likely to present with anxiety. "
5285,2,"The factors related to depression included female sex, divorced or separated individuals, and the online consultation mode. "
5286,2,COVID-19 quarantine was related with a lower likelihood of depression. 
5287,2,BMI was negatively correlated with depression. 
5288,2,"In multiple ordered logistic regression analysis, women were more likely than men to present with anxiety (odds ratio [OR] 2.181, 95% CI 1.365-3.486; P=.001). "
5289,2,"Women (OR 1.664, 95% CI 1.082-2.559; P=.02) and online patients (OR 2.631, 95% CI 1.305-5.304; P=.007) were more likely to have depression."
5290,3,Online patients had more anxiety or depression than offline patients. 
5291,3,"Anxiety was more prevalent in women, the unemployed, and those without confirmed cardiovascular disease. "
5292,3,Women and divorced or separated individuals were more prone to depression. 
5293,3,Increasing the frequency of doctor-patient communication and participating in video interactions can help improve patient cooperation.
5294,4,"Factors Influencing the Acceptability, Acceptance, and Adoption of Conversational Agents in Health Care: Integrative Review"
5295,0,"Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are digital dialog systems that enable people to have a text-based, speech-based, or nonverbal conversation with a computer or another machine based on natural language via an interface. "
5296,0,The use of CAs offers new opportunities and various benefits for health care. 
5297,0,"However, they are not yet ubiquitous in daily practice. "
5298,0,"Nevertheless, research regarding the implementation of CAs in health care has grown tremendously in recent years."
5299,1,We performed an integrative review. 
5300,1,"To identify relevant literature, a broad literature search was conducted in June 2021 with no date limits and using all fields in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, LIVIVO, and PsycINFO. "
5301,1,"To keep the review current, another search was conducted in March 2022. "
5302,1,"To identify as many eligible primary sources as possible, we used a snowballing approach by searching reference lists and conducted a hand search. "
5303,1,"Factors influencing the acceptability, acceptance, and adoption of CAs in health care were coded through parallel deductive and inductive approaches, which were informed by current technology acceptance and adoption models. "
5304,1,"Finally, the factors were synthesized in a thematic map."
5305,2,"Overall, 76 studies were included in this review. "
5306,2,"We identified influencing factors related to 4 core Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and hedonic motivation), with most studies underlining the relevance of performance and effort expectancy. "
5307,2,"To meet the particularities of the health care context, we redefined the UTAUT2 factors social influence, habit, and price value. "
5308,2,"We identified 6 other influencing factors: perceived risk, trust, anthropomorphism, health issue, working alliance, and user characteristics. "
5309,2,"Overall, we identified 10 factors influencing acceptability, acceptance, and adoption among health care professionals (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, price value, perceived risk, trust, anthropomorphism, working alliance, and user characteristics) and 13 factors influencing acceptability, acceptance, and adoption among patients (additionally hedonic motivation, habit, and health issue)."
5310,3,"This review shows manifold factors influencing the acceptability, acceptance, and adoption of CAs in health care. "
5311,3,Knowledge of these factors is fundamental for implementation planning. 
5312,3,"Therefore, the findings of this review can serve as a basis for future studies to develop appropriate implementation strategies. "
5313,3,"Furthermore, this review provides an empirical test of current technology acceptance and adoption models and identifies areas where additional research is necessary."
5314,4,The Effect of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial
5315,0,"Many people living with major depressive disorder (MDD) in China do not receive treatment owing to a lack of mental health services, along with significant stigma toward mental illness. "
5316,0,Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been proposed to increase access to mental health care for people with MDD.
5317,1,Patients with MDD were enrolled and randomized to the ICBT group or the waiting-list control (WLC) group. 
5318,1,The ICBT group received ICBT delivered through a WeChat mini-program with general support by nonspecialists. 
5319,1,"Participants in the 2 groups were self-evaluated online at baseline and posttreatment for changes in the primary outcome (ie, depressive symptoms) and secondary outcomes (ie, anxiety symptoms, nonspecific psychological distress, general self-efficacy, depression stigma, social functional impairment, and HRQoL). "
5320,1,"Changes in outcomes were measured by changes in overall scores on respective scales, and response and remission rates were calculated based on depressive symptoms. "
5321,1,"The acceptability of and satisfaction with the ICBT program were measured by treatment adherence and participants' feelings (ie, modules seriously completed, perceived benefit, and satisfaction)."
5322,2,We included 40 patients who were randomly assigned to the ICBT group and 44 who were assigned to the WLC group. 
5323,2,"Compared with the WLC group, the ICBT group had fewer depressive symptoms, fewer anxiety symptoms, less nonspecific psychological distress, and greater general self-efficacy. "
5324,2,"Moreover, the ICBT group had higher response (18/31, 58%) and remission rates (17/31, 55%). "
5325,2,"The adherence rate in the ICBT group was 78% (31/40), and the majority of participants who completed all ICBT modules were satisfied with the ICBT program."
5326,3,"ICBT demonstrated greater improvements in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, nonspecific psychological distress, and general self-efficacy among selected patients with MDD in comparison with the findings in waiting-list controls. "
5327,3,The ICBT program in this study had good acceptability and satisfaction among participants.
5328,4,Differing Behaviors Around Adult Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants and Opioids: Latent Class Analysis
5329,0,"The availability of central nervous system stimulants has risen in recent years, along with increased dispensing of stimulants for treatment of, for example, parent-reported attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and new diagnoses during adulthood. "
5330,0,"Typologies of drug use, as has been done with opioids, fail to include a sufficient range of behavioral factors to contextualize person-centric circumstances surrounding drug use. "
5331,0,Understanding these patterns across drug classes would bring public health and regulatory practices toward precision public health.
5332,1,"This study used a national cross-sectional web-based survey, using 3 survey launches from 2019 to 2020 (before the COVID-19 pandemic). "
5333,1,Data from adults who reported nonmedical use of prescription stimulants (n=2083) or prescription opioids (n=6127) in the last 12 months were analyzed. 
5334,1,A weighted latent class analysis was used to identify the patterns of use. 
5335,1,"Drug types, motivations, and behaviors were factors in the model, which characterized unique classes of behavior."
5336,2,"Five stimulant nonmedical use classes were identified: amphetamine self-medication, network-sourced stimulant for alertness, nonamphetamine performance use, recreational use, and nondiscriminatory behaviors. "
5337,2,"The drug used nonmedically, acquisition through a friend or family member, and use to get high were strong differentiators among the stimulant classes. "
5338,2,The latter 4 classes had significantly higher DAST-10 scores than amphetamine self-medication (P<.001). 
5339,2,"In addition, 4 opioid nonmedical use classes were identified: moderate pain with low mental health burden, high pain with higher mental health burden, risky behaviors with diverse motivations, and nondiscriminatory behaviors. "
5340,2,There was a progressive and significant increase in DAST-10 scores across classes (P<.001). 
5341,2,"The potency of the opioid, pain history, the routes of administration, and psychoactive effect behaviors were strong differentiators among the opioid classes."
5342,3,"A more precise understanding of how behaviors tend to co-occur would improve efficacy and efficiency in developing interventions and supporting the overall health of those who use drugs, and it would improve communication with, and connection to, those at risk for severe drug outcomes."
5343,4,The Current Status of the Use of Internet Hospitals for Outpatients With Pain: Retrospective Study
5344,0,"The national ""Internet +"" policies and the emergence of internet hospitals have created a new direction for the management of pain outside of the hospital. "
5345,0,"Nevertheless, there are no consolidated studies conducted by pain physicians on the current state of internet hospital-based online medical services used by patients with pain outside of a hospital setting."
5346,1,Detailed information was collected online and offline from outpatients with pain at the information technology center of West China Hospital of Sichuan University from February 2020 to April 2022. 
5347,1,Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the determinants that influenced patients' decisions to make an online visit to the internet hospital.
5348,2,"Over a 2-year period, 85,266 pain-related clinic visits were recorded. "
5349,2,"Ultimately, 39,260 patients were enrolled for the analysis, with 12.9% (5088/39,260) having online visits. "
5350,2,Both online and offline clinics had a greater number of visits by women than men. 
5351,2,"The average age of patients attending the online clinic was 46.85 (SD 16.56) years, whereas the average age of patients attending the offline clinic was 51.48 (SD 16.12) years. "
5352,2,"The majority of online clinic visitors (3059/5088, 60.1%) were employed, and one of the most common occupations was farming (721/5088, 14.2%). "
5353,2,"In addition, 51.8% (2635/5088) of patients who participated in the online clinics lived outside the hospital vicinity. "
5354,2,"Young (odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% CI 1.01-1.81; P=.045) and middle-aged (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.81-2.16; P<.001) patients, employed patients (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.18; P=.002), nonlocal patients (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.48-1.67; P<.001), and the ordinary staff (OR 1.19, 95%CI 1.01-1.39; P=.03) were more likely to have the intention to choose online visits through the internet hospitals."
5355,3,Internet hospitals are flourishing as a more efficient and promising method of pain management and follow-up for patients with pain outside the hospital. 
5356,3,"People with pain who are young, working, and not in the vicinity of hospitals are more likely to visit internet hospitals."
5357,4,Role of Caregivers in Remote Management of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Systematic Review of Literature
5358,0,"With the growing use of remote monitoring technologies in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), caregivers are becoming important resources that can be tapped into to improve patient care."
5359,1,"We performed a systematic review in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science up to 2022. "
5360,1,Studies that evaluated the role of caregivers in remote management of adult patients with T2DM were included. 
5361,1,"Outcomes such as diabetes control, adherence to medication, quality of life, frequency of home glucose monitoring, and health care use were evaluated."
5362,2,"Of the 1198 identified citations, 11 articles were included. "
5363,2,"The majority of studies were conducted in North America (7/11, 64%) and South America (2/11, 18%). "
5364,2,"The main types of caregivers studied were family or friends (10/11, 91%), while the most common remote monitoring modalities evaluated were interactive voice response (5/11, 45%) and phone consultations (4/11, 36%). "
5365,2,"With regard to diabetes control, 3 of 6 studies showed improvement in diabetes-related laboratory parameters. "
5366,2,A total of 2 studies showed improvements in patients' medication adherence rates and frequency of home glucose monitoring. 
5367,2,Studies that evaluated patients' quality of life showed mixed evidence.

5371,4,Selective Prevention of Depression in Workers Using a Smartphone App: Randomized Controlled Trial
5372,0,"There is increasing evidence that depression can be prevented; however, universal approaches have had limited success. "
5373,0,"Appropriate targeting of interventions to at-risk populations has been shown to have potential, but how to selectively determine at-risk individuals remains unclear. "
5374,0,"Workplace stress is a risk factor for depression and a target for intervention, but few interventions exist to prevent depression among workers at risk due to heightened stress."
5375,1,A randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants who were currently employed and reported no clinically significant depression and at least moderate stress. 
5376,1,"The intervention group (n=1053) were assignedAnchored, a 30-day self-directed smartphone app-based cognitive behavioral-and mindfulness-based intervention. "
5377,1,The attention-control group (n=1031) were assigned a psychoeducation website. 
5378,1,"Assessment was performed via web-based self-report questionnaires at baseline and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month postbaseline time points. "
5379,1,The primary outcome was new depression caseness aggregated over the follow-up period. 
5380,1,"The secondary outcomes included depressive and anxiety symptoms, stress, well-being, resilience, work performance, work-related burnout, and quality of life. "
5381,1,Analyses were conducted within an intention-to-treat framework using mixed modeling.
5382,2,"There was no significant between-group difference in new depression caseness (z score=0.69; P=.49); however, those in the Anchored arm had significantly greater depressive symptom reduction at 1 month (Cohen d=0.02; P=.049) and 6 months (Cohen d=0.08; P=.03). "
5383,2,"Anchored participants also showed significantly greater reduction in anxiety symptoms at 1 month (Cohen d=0.07; P=.04) and increased work performance at 1 month (Cohen d=0.07; P=.008) and 6 months (Cohen d=0.13; P=.01), compared with controls. "
5384,2,"Notably, for Anchored participants completing at least two-thirds of the intervention, there was a significantly lower rate of depression onset (1.1%, 95% CI 0.0%-3.7%) compared with controls (9.0%, 95% CI 6.8%-12.3%) at 1 month (z score=4.50; P<.001). "
5385,2,"Significant small to medium effect sizes for most secondary outcomes were seen in the highly engaged Anchored users compared with controls, with effects maintained at the 6-month follow-up for depressive symptoms, well-being, stress, and quality of life."
5386,3,"Anchored was associated with a small comparative reduction in depressive symptoms compared with controls, although selective prevention of case-level depression was not observed in the intention-to-treat analysis. "
5387,3,"When users adequately engaged with the app, significant findings pertaining to depression prevention, overall symptom reduction, and functional improvement were found, compared with controls. "
5388,3,There is a need for a greater focus on engagement techniques in future research.
5389,4,Evaluating the Potential of Machine Learning and Wearable Devices in End-of-Life Care in Predicting 7-Day Death Events Among Patients With Terminal Cancer: Cohort Study
5390,0,An accurate prediction of mortality in end-of-life care is crucial but presents challenges. 
5391,0,"Existing prognostic tools demonstrate moderate performance in predicting survival across various time frames, primarily in in-hospital settings and single-time evaluations. "
5392,0,"However, these tools may fail to capture the individualized and diverse trajectories of patients. "
5393,0,"Limited evidence exists regarding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and wearable devices, specifically among patients with cancer at the end of life."
5394,1,This prospective study was conducted at the National Taiwan University Hospital. 
5395,1,"Patients diagnosed with cancer and receiving end-of-life care were invited to enroll in wards, outpatient clinics, and home-based care settings. "
5396,1,"Each participant was given a smartwatch to collect physiological data, including steps taken, heart rate, sleep time, and blood oxygen saturation. "
5397,1,Clinical assessments were conducted weekly. 
5398,1,The participants were followed until the end of life or up to 52 weeks. 
5399,1,"With these input features, we evaluated the prediction performance of several machine learning-based classifiers and a deep neural network in 7-day death events. "
5400,1,"We used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), F1-score, accuracy, and specificity as evaluation metrics. "
5401,1,A Shapley additive explanations value analysis was performed to further explore the models with good performance.
5402,2,"From September 2021 to August 2022, overall, 1657 data points were collected from 40 patients with a median survival time of 34 days, with the detection of 28 death events. "
5403,2,"Among the proposed models, extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) yielded the best result, with an AUROC of 96%, F1-score of 78.5%, accuracy of 93%, and specificity of 97% on the testing set. "
5404,2,The Shapley additive explanations value analysis identified the average heart rate as the most important feature. 
5405,2,"Other important features included steps taken, appetite, urination status, and clinical care phase."
5406,3,We demonstrated the successful prediction of patient deaths within the next 7 days using a combination of wearable devices and AI. 
5407,3,"Our findings highlight the potential of integrating AI and wearable technology into clinical end-of-life care, offering valuable insights and supporting clinical decision-making for personalized patient care. "
5408,3,"It is important to acknowledge that our study was conducted in a relatively small cohort; thus, further research is needed to validate our approach and assess its impact on clinical care.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05054907; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05054907"
5409,4,Defining Misinformation and Related Terms in Health-Related Literature: Scoping Review
5410,0,Misinformation poses a serious challenge to clinical and policy decision-making in the health field. 
5411,0,The COVID-19 pandemic amplified interest in misinformation and related terms and witnessed a proliferation of definitions.
5412,1,"We conducted a scoping review of systematic reviews by searching Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Epistemonikos databases for articles published within the last 5 years up till March 2023. "
5413,1,"Eligible studies were systematic reviews that stated misinformation or related terms as part of their objectives, conducted a systematic search of at least one database, and reported at least 1 definition for misinformation or related terms. "
5414,1,"We extracted definitions for the terms misinformation, disinformation, fake news, infodemic, and malinformation. "
5415,1,"Within each definition, we identified concepts and mapped them across misinformation-related terms."
5416,2,"We included 41 eligible systematic reviews, out of which 32 (78%) reviews addressed the topic of public health emergencies (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and contained 75 definitions for misinformation and related terms. "
5417,2,"The definitions consisted of 20 for misinformation, 19 for disinformation, 10 for fake news, 24 for infodemic, and 2 for malinformation. "
5418,2,"""False/inaccurate/incorrect"" was mentioned in 15 of 20 definitions of misinformation, 13 of 19 definitions of disinformation, 5 of 10 definitions of fake news, 6 of 24 definitions of infodemic, and 0 of 2 definitions of malinformation. "
5419,2,"Infodemic had 19 of 24 definitions addressing ""information overload"" and malinformation had 2 of 2 definitions with ""accurate"" and 1 definition ""used in the wrong context."" Out of all the definitions, 56 (75%) were referenced from other sources."
5420,3,"While the definitions of misinformation and related terms in the health field had inconstancies and variability, they were largely consistent. "
5421,3,"Inconstancies related to the intentionality in misinformation definitions (7 definitions mention ""unintentional,"" while 5 definitions have ""intentional""). "
5422,3,"They also related to the content of infodemic (9 definitions mention ""valid and invalid info,"" while 6 definitions have ""false/inaccurate/incorrect""). "
5423,3,"The inclusion of concepts such as ""intentional"" may be difficult to operationalize as it is difficult to ascertain one's intentions. "
5424,3,This scoping review has the strength of using a systematic method for retrieving articles but does not cover all definitions in the extant literature outside the field of health. 
5425,3,"This scoping review of the health literature identified several definitions for misinformation and related terms, which showed variability and included concepts that are difficult to operationalize. "
5426,3,Health practitioners need to exert caution before labeling a piece of information as misinformation or any other related term and only do so after ascertaining accurateness and sometimes intentionality. 
5427,3,Additional efforts are needed to allow future consensus around clear and operational definitions.
5428,4,The Effects of Stakeholder Perceptions on the Use of Humanoid Robots in Care for Older Adults: Postinteraction Cross-Sectional Study
5429,0,Efficient use of humanoid social robots in the care for older adults requires precise knowledge of expectations in this area. 
5430,0,There is little research in this field that includes the interaction of stakeholders with the robot. 
5431,0,Even fewer studies have compared the perceptions of older people (as care recipients) and professional caregivers (representing those taking care of older adults in teams with robots).
5432,1,The studied group was a conveniently available sample of individuals who took part in the presentation of and interaction with a humanoid social robot. 
5433,1,"Among them, there were 48 community-dwelling older adults (aged & GE;60 years), who were participants of day care units (which may signal the presence of self-care needs), and 53 professional caregivers. "
5434,1,"The participants were asked to express their views after an interaction with a humanoid social robot (TIAGo) using the Users' Needs, Requirements and Abilities Questionnaire (UNRAQ) and the Godspeed Questionnaire Series (GQS)."
5435,2,"Compared to the caregivers, older adults not only assessed the robot more positively with respect to its roles as a companion and assistant (P=.009 and P=.003, respectively) but also had higher scores on their need to increase their knowledge about the robot (P=.049). "
5436,2,"Regarding the robot's functions, the greatest differences between groups were observed for the social aspects on the UNRAQ, including decreasing the sense of loneliness (P=.003) and accompanying the user in everyday activities (P=.005). "
5437,2,"As for the GQS, the mean scores of the Animacy, Likeability, and Perceived Intelligence scales were significantly higher for older participants than for caregivers (P=.04, P<.001, and P<.001, respectively). "
5438,2,The only parameter for which the caregivers' scores were higher than those of the older adults was the Artificial-Lifelike item from the Anthropomorphism scale of the GQS (P=.03).
5439,3,"The acceptance of the social functions of a humanoid robot is related to its perception in all analyzed aspects, whereas the expected usefulness of a care robot is not linked to aspects of anthropomorphism. "
5440,3,"Successful implementation of robots in the care for older people thus depends on considering not only the fears, needs, and requirements of various stakeholders but also on the perceptions of the robot. "
5441,3,"Given the differences between the stakeholders, targeted and properly structured educational and training activities for caregivers and prospective users may enable a seamless integration of robotic technologies in care provision."
5442,4,ChatGPT vs Google for Queries Related to Dementia and Other Cognitive Decline: Comparison of Results
5443,0,People living with dementia or other cognitive decline and their caregivers (PLWD) increasingly rely on the web to find information about their condition and available resources and services. 
5444,0,"The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provide a new alternative to the more traditional web search engines, such as Google."
5445,1,A set of 30 informational and 30 service delivery (transactional) PLWD-related queries were selected and submitted to both Google and ChatGPT. 
5446,1,"Three domain experts assessed the results for their currency of information, reliability of the source, objectivity, relevance to the query, and similarity of their response. "
5447,1,The readability of the results was also analyzed. 
5448,1,Interrater reliability coefficients were calculated for all outcomes.
5449,2,Google had superior currency and higher reliability. 
5450,2,ChatGPT results were evaluated as more objective. 
5451,2,"ChatGPT had a significantly higher response relevance, while Google often drew upon sources that were referral services for dementia care or service providers themselves. "
5452,2,"The readability was low for both platforms, especially for ChatGPT (mean grade level 12.17, SD 1.94) compared to Google (mean grade level 9.86, SD 3.47). "
5453,2,"The similarity between the content of ChatGPT and Google responses was rated as high for 13 (21.7%) responses, medium for 16 (26.7%) responses, and low for 31 (51.6%) responses."
5454,3,Both Google and ChatGPT have strengths and weaknesses. 
5455,3,ChatGPT rarely includes the source of a result. 
5456,3,"Google more often provides a date for and a known reliable source of the response compared to ChatGPT, whereas ChatGPT supplies more relevant responses to queries. "
5457,3,The results of ChatGPT may be out of date and often do not specify a validity time stamp. 
5458,3,Google sometimes returns results based on commercial entities. 
5459,3,The readability scores for both indicate that responses are often not appropriate for persons with low health literacy skills. 
5460,3,"In the future, the addition of both the source and the date of health-related information and availability in other languages may increase the value of these platforms for both nonmedical and medical professionals."
5461,4,Graded Response Model Analysis and Computer Adaptive Test Simulation of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21: Evaluation and Validation Study
5462,0,The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) is a mental health screening tool with conflicting studies regarding its factor structure. 
5463,0,No studies have yet attempted to develop a computer adaptive test (CAT) version of it.
5464,1,"An evaluation sample (n=580) was used to evaluate the DASS-21 scales via confirmatory factor analysis, Mokken analysis, and graded response modeling. "
5465,1,"A CAT was simulated with a validation sample (n=248) and a simulated sample (n=10,000) to confirm the generalizability of the model developed."
5466,2,"A bifactor model, also known as the ""quadripartite"" model (1 general factor with 3 specific factors) in the context of the DASS-21, displayed good fit. "
5467,2,All scales displayed acceptable fit with the graded response model. 
5468,2,"Simulation of 3 unidimensional (depression, anxiety, and stress) CATs resulted in an average 17% to 48% reduction in items administered when a reliability of 0.80 was acceptable."
5469,3,This study clarifies previous conflicting findings regarding the DASS-21 factor structure and suggests that the quadripartite model for the DASS-21 items fits best. 
5470,3,Item response theory modeling suggests that the items measure their respective constructs best between 0 theta and 3 theta (mild to moderate severity).
5471,4,Efficacy of a Digital Mental Health Biopsychosocial Transdiagnostic Intervention With or Without Therapist Assistance for Adults With Anxiety and Depression: Adaptive Randomized Controlled Trial
5472,0,Digital mental health (DMH) interventions incorporating elements that adapt to the evolving needs of consumers have the potential to further our understanding of the optimal intensity of therapist assistance and inform stepped-care models.
5473,1,"In a randomized adaptive clinical trial design, all participants had access to the DMH program, with eligibility to have their program augmented with therapist assistance determined by program engagement or symptom severity. "
5474,1,Participants who met stepped-care criteria were randomized to have their treatment program augmented with either low-intensity (10 min/week of video chat support for 7 weeks) or high-intensity (50 min/week of video chat support for 7 weeks) therapist assistance. 
5475,1,"A total of 103 participants (mean age 34.17, SD 10.50 years) were assessed before (week 0), during (weeks 3 and 6), and after the intervention (week 9) and at the 3-month follow-up (week 21). "
5476,1,"The effects of 3 treatment conditions (DMH program only, DMH program+low-intensity therapist assistance, and DMH program+high-intensity therapist assistance) on changes in the 2 primary outcomes of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7]) and depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) were assessed using the Cohen d, reliable change index, and mixed-effects linear regression analyses."
5477,2,There were no substantial differences in the outcome measures among intervention conditions. 
5478,2,"However, there were significant time effect changes in most outcomes over time. "
5479,2,"All 3 intervention conditions demonstrated strong and significant treatment effect changes in GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores, with absolute Cohen d values ranging from 0.82 to 1.79 (all P<.05). "
5480,2,"The mixed-effects models revealed that, in the Life Flex program-only condition at week 3, mean GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores significantly decreased from baseline by 3.54 and 4.38 (all P<.001), respectively. "
5481,2,"At weeks 6, 9, and 21, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores significantly decreased from baseline by at least 6 and 7 points (all P<.001), respectively. "
5482,2,Nonresponders at week 3 who were stepped up to therapist assistance increased program engagement and treatment response. 
5483,2,"At the postintervention time point and 3-month follow-up, 67% (44/65) and 69% (34/49) of the participants, respectively, no longer met diagnostic criteria for anxiety or depression."
5484,3,The findings highlight that early detection of low engagement and non-treatment response presents an opportunity to effectively intervene by incorporating an adaptive design. 
5485,3,"Although the study findings indicate that therapist assistance was no more effective than the DMH intervention program alone for reducing symptoms of anxiety or depression, the data highlight the potential influence of participant selection bias and participant preferences within stepped-care treatment models."
5486,4,Gender Bias When Using Artificial Intelligence to Assess Anorexia Nervosa on Social Media: Data-Driven Study
5487,0,Social media sites are becoming an increasingly important source of information about mental health disorders. 
5488,0,"Among them, eating disorders are complex psychological problems that involve unhealthy eating habits. "
5489,0,"In particular, there is evidence showing that signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa can be traced in social media platforms. "
5490,0,"Knowing that input data biases tend to be amplified by artificial intelligence algorithms and, in particular, machine learning, these methods should be revised to mitigate biased discrimination in such important domains."
5491,1,We first inspected the predictive performance differences between the algorithms for male and female users. 
5492,1,"Once biases were detected, we applied a feature-level bias characterization to evaluate the source of such biases and performed a comparative analysis of such features and those that are relevant for clinicians. "
5493,1,"Finally, we showcased different bias mitigation strategies to develop fairer automated classifiers, particularly for risk assessment in sensitive domains."
5494,2,"Our results revealed concerning predictive performance differences, with substantially higher false negative rates (FNRs) for female samples (FNR=0.082) compared with male samples (FNR=0.005). "
5495,2,"The findings show that biological processes and suicide risk factors were relevant for classifying positive male cases, whereas age, emotions, and personal concerns were more relevant for female cases. "
5496,2,"We also proposed techniques for bias mitigation, and we could see that, even though disparities can be mitigated, they cannot be eliminated."
5497,3,We concluded that more attention should be paid to the assessment of biases in automated methods dedicated to the detection of mental health issues. 
5498,3,"This is particularly relevant before the deployment of systems that are thought to assist clinicians, especially considering that the outputs of such systems can have an impact on the diagnosis of people at risk."
5499,4,Long-Term Impact of a Smartphone App on Prescriber Adherence to Antibiotic Guidelines for Adult Patients With Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Interrupted Time-Series Study
5500,0,"Mobile health platforms like smartphone apps that provide clinical guidelines are ubiquitous, yet their long-term impact on guideline adherence remains unclear. "
5501,0,"In 2016, an antibiotic guidelines app, called SCRIPT, was introduced in Auckland City Hospital, New Zealand, to provide local antibiotic guidelines to clinicians on their smartphones."
5502,1,"We analyzed antibiotic guideline adherence rates during the first 24 hours of hospital admission in adults diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia using an interrupted time-series study with 3 distinct periods post app implementation (ie, 3, 12, and 24 months)."
5503,2,"Adherence increased from 23% (46/200) at baseline to 31% (73/237) at 3 months and 34% (69/200) at 12 months, reducing to 31% (62/200) at 24 months post app implementation (P=.07 vs baseline). "
5504,2,"However, increased adherence was sustained in patients with pulmonary consolidation on x-ray (9/63, 14% at baseline; 23/77, 30% after 3 months; 32/92, 35% after 12 month; and 32/102, 31% after 24 months; P=.04 vs baseline)."
5505,3,"An antibiotic guidelines app increased overall adherence, but this was not sustained. "
5506,3,"In patients with pulmonary consolidation, the increased adherence was sustained."
5507,4,Influence of E-consultation on the Intention of First-Visit Patients to Select Medical Services: Results of a Scenario Survey
5508,0,"E-consultation is expected to improve the information level of patients, affect patients' subsequent judgments of medical services, and guide patients to make a reasonable medical selection in the future. "
5509,0,"Thus, it is important to understand the influence mechanism of e-consultation on patients' medical selection."
5510,1,Patients' medical selection before and after e-consultation was compared using a scenario survey. 
5511,1,"Based on the service characteristics of the e-consultation platform, representative simulation scenarios were determined, and parallel control groups were set up considering the order effect in comparison. "
5512,1,"Finally, a total of 4 scenario simulation questionnaires were designed. "
5513,1,A total of 4164 valid questionnaires were collected through the online questionnaire collection platform. 
5514,1,"Patients' perception of disease severity, evaluation of treatment capacity of medical institutions, selection of hospitals and doctors, and other outcome indicators were tested to analyze the differences in patients' evaluation and choice of medical services before and after e-consultation. "
5515,1,"Additionally, the results' stability was tested by regression analysis."
5516,2,"In scenario 1 (mild case), before e-consultation, 14.1% (104/740) of participants considered their conditions as not serious. "
5517,2,"After e-consultation, 69.5% (539/775) of them considered their diseases as not serious. "
5518,2,"Furthermore, participants' evaluation of the disease treatment capacity of medical institutions at all levels had improved after using e-consultation. "
5519,2,"In scenario 3 (severe case), before e-consultation, 54.1% (494/913) of the participants believed their diseases were very serious. "
5520,2,"After e-consultation, 16.6% (157/945) considered their diseases were very serious. "
5521,2,"The evaluation of disease treatment capacity of medical institutions in nontertiary hospitals decreased, whereas that of tertiary hospitals improved. "
5522,2,"In both mild and severe cases, before e-consultation, all of the participants were inclined to directly visit the hospital. "
5523,2,"After e-consultation, more than 71.4% (553/775) of the patients with mild diseases chose self-treatment, whereas those with severe diseases still opted for a face-to-face consultation. "
5524,2,"After e-consultation, patients who were set on being treated in a hospital, regardless of the disease severity, preferred to select the tertiary hospitals. "
5525,2,"Of the patients with mild diseases who chose to go to a hospital, 25.7% (57/222) wanted to consult online doctors face-to-face. "
5526,2,"By contrast, 56.4% (506/897) of the severe cases wanted to consult online doctors face-to-face."
5527,3,E-consultation can help patients accurately enhance their awareness of the disease and guide them to make a more reasonable medical selection. 
5528,3,"However, it is likely that e-consultation makes online medical services centralized. "
5529,3,"Additionally, the guiding effect of e-consultation is limited, and e-consultation needs to be combined with other supporting systems conducive to medical selection to play an improved role."
5530,4,Implementation Cascade of a Social Network-Based HIV Self-testing Approach for Men Who Have Sex With Men: Cross-sectional Study
5531,0,HIV testing is the cornerstone of strategies for achieving the fast-track target to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. 
5532,0,Self-testing has been proven to be an effective health intervention for men who have sex with men (MSM). 
5533,0,"While social network-based approaches for distributing HIV self-tests are recommended by the World Health Organization, their implementation consists of multiple steps that need to be properly evaluated."
5534,1,This is a cross-sectional study. 
5535,1,"Seed MSM participants were recruited through different web-based channels, who in turn invited their peers to participate in this study. "
5536,1,A web-based platform was set up to support the recruitment and referral process. 
5537,1,"Participants could request for an oral fluid or a finger-prick HIV self-test, with or without real-time support, after completing a self-administered questionnaire. "
5538,1,Referrals could be made upon uploading the test result and passing the web-based training. 
5539,1,Characteristics of participants completing each of these steps and their preferences for the type of HIV self-test were evaluated.
5540,2,"A total of 463 MSM were recruited, including 150 seeds. "
5541,2,"Participants recruited by seeds were less likely to have previously been tested for HIV (odds ratio [OR] 1.80, 95% CI 1.06-3.04, P=.03) and have lower confidence in performing self-tests (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.99, P=.045). "
5542,2,"Almost all (434/442, 98%) MSM who completed the questionnaire requested a self-test, of whom 82% (354/434) had uploaded their test results. "
5543,2,"Participants requesting support were new to self-testing (OR 3.65, 95% CI 2.10-6.35, P<.001) and less confident in carrying out the self-test correctly (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22-0.56, P<.001). "
5544,2,"More than half (216/354, 61%) of the eligible participants initiated the referral process by attempting the web-based training with a passing rate of 93% (200/216). "
5545,2,"They were more likely to have sought sex partners (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.14-4.25, P=.02), especially through location-based networking apps (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.31-3.49, P=.002). "
5546,2,"They also gave higher usability scores along the implementation cascade (median 81 vs 75, P=.003)."
5547,3,The social network approach was effective in diffusing HIV self-tests in the MSM community and reaching nontesters. 
5548,3,Support and option to choose a preferable type of self-test are essential to address users' individual needs when delivering HIV self-tests. 
5549,3,A positive user experience throughout the processes along the implementation cascade is vital to transform a tester into a promoter.
5550,4,"Development and Validation of a Respiratory-Responsive Vocal Biomarker-Based Tool for Generalizable Detection of Respiratory Impairment: Independent Case-Control Studies in Multiple Respiratory Conditions Including Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and COVID-19"
5551,0,"Vocal biomarker-based machine learning approaches have shown promising results in the detection of various health conditions, including respiratory diseases, such as asthma."
5552,1,A logistic regression model using a weighted sum of voice acoustic features was previously trained and validated on a data set of approximately 1700 patients with a confirmed asthma diagnosis and a similar number of healthy controls. 
5553,1,"The same model has shown generalizability to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, and cough. "
5554,1,"In this study, 497 participants (female: n=268, 53.9%; <65 years old: n=467, 94%; Marathi speakers: n=253, 50.9%; English speakers: n=223, 44.9%; Spanish speakers: n=25, 5%) were enrolled across 4 clinical sites in the United States and India and provided voice samples and symptom reports on their personal smartphones. "
5555,1,The participants included patients who are symptomatic COVID-19 positive and negative as well as asymptomatic HVs. 
5556,1,The RRVB model performance was assessed by comparing it with the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
5557,2,"The ability of the RRVB model to differentiate patients with respiratory conditions from healthy controls was previously demonstrated on validation data in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, and cough, with ORs of 4.3, 9.1, 3.1, and 3.9, respectively. "
5558,2,"The same RRVB model in this study in COVID-19 performed with a sensitivity of 73.2%, specificity of 62.9%, and OR of 4.64 (P<.001). "
5559,2,"Patients who experienced respiratory symptoms were detected more frequently than those who did not experience respiratory symptoms and completely asymptomatic patients (sensitivity: 78.4% vs 67.4% vs 68%, respectively)."
5560,3,"The RRVB model has shown good generalizability across respiratory conditions, geographies, and languages. "
5561,3,Results using data set of patients with COVID-19 demonstrate its meaningful potential to serve as a prescreening tool for identifying individuals at risk for COVID-19 infection in combination with temperature and symptom reports. 
5562,3,"Although not a COVID-19 test, these results suggest that the RRVB model can encourage targeted testing. "
5563,3,"Moreover, the generalizability of this model for detecting respiratory symptoms across different linguistic and geographic contexts suggests a potential path for the development and validation of voice-based tools for broader disease surveillance and monitoring applications in the future."
5564,4,General Practitioners Experiences With Potentials and Pitfalls of Video Consultations in Norway During the COVID-19 Lockdown: Qualitative Analysis of Free-Text Survey Answers
5565,0,The use of video consultations (VCs) in Norwegian general practice rapidly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
5566,0,"During societal lockdowns, VCs were used for nearly all types of clinical problems, as in-person consultations were kept to a minimum."
5567,1,"Between April 14 and May 3, 2020, all regular Norwegian GPs (N=4858) were invited to answer a web-based survey, which included open-ended questions about their experiences with the advantages and pitfalls of VCs. "
5568,1,A total of 2558 free-text answers were provided by 657 of the 1237 GPs who participated in the survey. 
5569,1,The material was subjected to reflexive thematic analysis.
5570,2,Four main themes were identified. 
5571,2,"First, VCs are described as being particularly convenient, informative, and effective for consultations with previously known patients. "
5572,2,"Second, strategically planned VCs may facilitate effective tailoring of clinical trajectories that optimize clinical workflow. "
5573,2,"VCs allow for an initial overview of the problem (triage), follow-up evaluation after an in-person consultation, provision of advice and information concerning test results and discharge notes, extension of sick leaves, and delivery of other medical certificates. "
5574,2,"VCs may, in certain situations, enhance the GPs' insight in their patients' relational and socioeconomical resources and vulnerabilities, and even facilitate relationship-building with patients in need of care who might otherwise be reluctant to seek help. "
5575,2,"Third, VCs are characterized by a demarcated communication style and the ""one problem approach,"" which may entail effectiveness in the short run. "
5576,2,"However, the web-based communication climate implies degradation of valuable nonverbal signals that are more evidently present in in-person consultations. "
5577,2,"Finally, overreliance on VCs may, in a longer perspective, undermine the establishment and maintenance of relational trust, with a negative impact on the quality of care and patient safety. "
5578,2,"Compensatory mechanisms include clarifying with the patient what the next step is, answering any questions and giving further advice on treatment if conditions do not improve or there is a need for follow-up. "
5579,2,Participation of family members can also be helpful to improve reciprocal understanding and safety.
5580,3,The findings have relevance for future implementation of VCs and deserve further exploration under less stressful circumstances.
5581,4,A Comparison of Womens and Mens Web-Based Information-Seeking Behaviors About Gender-Related Health Information: Web-Based Survey Study of a Stratified German Sample
5582,0,"Gender-sensitive approaches to health communication aim to integrate gender perspectives at all levels of communication, as an individual's biological sex and socially assigned gender identity have an impact on whether and how one acquires what type of health information. "
5583,0,"Due to the fast and low-cost opportunity to search for a wide range of information, the internet seems to be a particularly suitable place for gender-related health information about diseases of sex-specific organs and diseases where biological differences are associated with different health risks."
5584,1,Data from a stratified web-based survey of the German population (N=3000) explained gender-related web-based HISB and influencing patterns comparing women and men. 
5585,1,The applicability of PRISM to gender-related web-based HISB was tested using structural equation modeling and a multigroup comparison.
5586,2,The results revealed PRISM as an effective framework for explaining gender-related web-based HISB. 
5587,2,The model accounted for 28.8% of the variance in gender-related web-based HISB. 
5588,2,"Gender-related subjective norms provided the most crucial explanatory power, followed by perceived seeking control. "
5589,2,The multigroup comparison revealed differences in the model's explanatory power and the relevance of predictors of gender-related web-based HISB. 
5590,2,The share of explained variances of web-based HISB is higher in men than in women. 
5591,2,"For men, norms were a more relevant promoting factor, whereas web-based HISB of women was more strongly associated with perceived seeking control."
5592,3,The results are crucial for gender-sensitive targeting strategies and suggest gender-related health information interventions that address gender-related subjective norms. 
5593,3,"Furthermore, programs (eg, web-based learning units) should be developed and offered to improve individuals' (perceived) abilities to perform web-based searches for health information, as those with higher control beliefs are more likely to access web-based information."
5594,4,Evolving Face Mask Guidance During a Pandemic and Potential Harm to Public Perception: Infodemiology Study of Sentiment and Emotion on Twitter
5595,0,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention policies on face mask use fluctuated. "
5596,0,"Understanding how public health communications evolve around key policy decisions may inform future decisions on preventative measures by aiding the design of communication strategies (eg, wording, timing, and channel) that ensure rapid dissemination and maximize both widespread adoption and sustained adherence."
5597,1,We applied an interrupted time series method to US Twitter data surrounding each guideline change. 
5598,1,"Outcomes were changes in the (1) proportion of positive, negative, and neutral tweets and (2) number of words within a tweet tagged with a given emotion (eg, trust). "
5599,1,Results were compared to COVID-19 Twitter data without mask keywords for the same period.
5600,2,"There were fewer neutral mask-related tweets in 2020 (beta=-3.94 percentage points, 95% CI -4.68 to -3.21; P<.001) and 2021 (beta=-8.74, 95% CI -9.31 to -8.17; P<.001). "
5601,2,"Following the April 3 recommendation (beta=.51, 95% CI .43-.59; P<.001) and May 13 relaxation (beta=3.43, 95% CI 1.61-5.26; P<.001), the percent of negative mask-related tweets increased. "
5602,2,"The quantity of trust-related terms decreased following the policy change on April 3 (beta=-.004, 95% CI -.004 to -.003; P<.001) and May 13 (beta=-.001, 95% CI -.002 to 0; P=.008)."
5603,3,"The US Twitter population responded negatively and with less trust following guideline shifts related to masking, regardless of whether the guidelines recommended or relaxed mask usage. "
5604,3,Federal agencies should ensure that changes in public health recommendations are communicated concisely and rapidly.
5605,4,Effects of Fetal Images Produced in Virtual Reality on Maternal-Fetal Attachment: Randomized Controlled Trial
5606,0,Maternal-fetal attachment (MFA) has been reported to be associated with the postpartum mother-infant relationship. 
5607,0,"Seeing the fetus through ultrasound might influence MFA, and the effect could be increased by more realistic images, such as those generated in virtual reality (VR)."
5608,1,This 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial involved a total of 80 pregnant women. 
5609,1,Eligible women were randomly assigned to either a mobile app-only group (n=40) or an app plus VR group (n=40). 
5610,1,The VR group experienced their own baby's images generated in VR based on images obtained from fetal ultrasonography. 
5611,1,"The prenatal-coaching mobile app recommended health behavior for the pregnant women according to gestational age, provided feedback on entered data for maternal weight, blood pressure, and glucose levels, and included a private diary service for fetal ultrasound images. "
5612,1,"Both groups received the same app, but the VR group also viewed fetal images produced in VR; these images were stored in the app. "
5613,1,"All participants filled out questionnaires to assess MFA, depressive symptoms, and other basic medical information. "
5614,1,The questionnaires were filled out again after the interventions.
5615,2,Basic demographic data were comparable between the 2 groups. 
5616,2,"Most of the assessments showed comparable results for the 2 groups, but the mean score to assess interaction with the fetus was significantly higher for the VR group than the control group (0.4 vs 0.1, P=.004). "
5617,2,"The proportion of participants with an increased score for this category after the intervention was significantly higher in the VR group than the control group (43% vs 13%, P=.005). "
5618,2,The feedback questionnaire revealed that scores for the degree of perception of fetal appearance all increased after the intervention in the VR group.
5619,3,The use of a mobile app with fetal images in VR significantly increased maternal interaction with the fetus.
5620,4,The Factors Associated With Telehealth Use and Avoidance During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Survey
5621,0,Social distancing requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic saw a rapid increase in the delivery of telehealth consultations as an alternative to face-to-face health care services.
5622,1,Data were obtained from waves 4 and 7 of a longitudinal survey designed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and behavior of a representative sample of Australian adults. 
5623,1,"Participants reported on their use or avoidance of telehealth during the assessment period, as well as the mode of telehealth used and acceptability."
5624,2,"Approximately 30% of participants reported using telehealth during the assessment periods, with the most common telehealth modality being the telephone. "
5625,2,Acceptance of telehealth was generally high and was higher among those who used telehealth compared with those who did not. 
5626,2,Approximately 18% of participants reported avoiding health care due to telehealth. 
5627,2,"Across assessment waves, avoidance was associated with younger age, speaking a language other than or in addition to English, having a current medical diagnosis, and lower levels of telehealth acceptability."
5628,3,"While most participants in this study were accepting of telehealth services, there remain barriers to use, especially among those from particular sociodemographic groups. "
5629,3,"At a population level, avoidance of health services in nearly one in five adults may have considerable long-term impacts on morbidity and potentially mortality. "
5630,3,"Targeted efforts to promote engagement with telehealth services are critical if these adverse outcomes are to be avoided, particularly during periods when access to face-to-face services may be limited."
5631,4,Facilitators of and Barriers to Accessing Hospital Medical Specialty Telemedicine Consultations During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review
5632,0,"The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the interest in implementing mobile health (mHealth) in population-based health studies, but evidence is lacking on engagement and adherence in studies. "
5633,0,We conducted a fully remote study for >= 6 months tracking COVID-19 digital biomarkers and symptoms using a smartphone app nested within an existing cohort of adults.
5634,1,"Participants in the Fenland COVID-19 study were invited to the app substudy from August 2020 to October 2020 until study closure (April 30, 2021). "
5635,1,"Participants were asked to complete digital biomarker modules (oxygen saturation, body temperature, and resting heart rate [RHR]) and possible COVID-19 symptoms in the app 3 times per week. "
5636,1,"Participants manually entered the measurements, except RHR that was measured using the smartphone camera. "
5637,1,"Engagement was categorized by median weekly frequency of completing the 3 digital biomarker modules (categories: 0, 1-2, and =3 times per week). "
5638,1,Sociodemographic and health characteristics of those who did or did not consent to the substudy and by engagement category were explored. 
5639,1,"Semistructured interviews were conducted with 35 participants who were purposively sampled by sex, age, educational attainment, and engagement category, and data were analyzed thematically; 63% (22/35) of the participants consented to the app substudy, and 37% (13/35) of the participants did not consent."
5640,2,A total of 62.61% (2524/4031) of Fenland COVID-19 study participants consented to the app substudy. 
5641,2,"Of those, 90.21% (2277/2524) completed the app onboarding process. "
5642,2,Median time in the app substudy was 34.5 weeks (IQR 34-37) with no change in engagement from 0 to 3 months or 3 to 6 months. 
5643,2,"Completion rates (=1 per week) across the study between digital biomarkers were similar (RHR: 56,517/77,664, 72.77%; temperature: 56,742/77,664, 73.06%; oxygen saturation: 57,088/77,664, 73.51%). "
5644,2,"Older age groups and lower managerial and intermediate occupations were associated with higher engagement, whereas working, being a current smoker, being overweight or obese, and high perceived stress were associated with lower engagement. "
5645,2,"Continued engagement was facilitated through routine and personal motivation, and poor engagement was caused by user error and app or equipment malfunctions preventing data input. "
5646,2,"From these results, we developed key recommendations to improve engagement in population-based mHealth studies."
5647,3,This mixed methods study demonstrated both high initial and sustained engagement in a large mHealth COVID-19 study over a =6-month period. 
5648,3,Being nested in a known cohort study enabled the identification of participant characteristics and factors associated with engagement to inform future applications in population-based health research.
5649,4,Factors Associated With Telemedicine Use Among German General Practitioners and Rheumatologists: Secondary Analysis of Data From a Nationwide Survey
5650,0,Previous studies have demonstrated telemedicine (TM) to be an effective tool to complement rheumatology care and address workforce shortage. 
5651,0,"With the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, TM experienced a massive upswing. "
5652,0,"However, in rheumatology care, the use of TM stagnated again shortly thereafter. "
5653,0,"Consequently, the factors associated with physicians' willingness to use TM (TM willingness) and actual use of TM (TM use) need to be thoroughly investigated."
5654,1,We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a German nationwide cross-sectional survey with general practitioners and rheumatologists. 
5655,1,Bayesian univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to the data to determine which factors were associated with TM use and TM willingness. 
5656,1,"The predictor variables (covariates) that were studied individually included sociodemographic factors (eg, age and sex), work characteristics (eg, practice location and medical specialty), and self-assessed knowledge of TM. "
5657,1,All the variables positively and negatively associated with TM use and TM willingness in the univariate analysis were then considered for Bayesian model averaging analysis after a selection based on the variance inflation factor (<= 2.5). 
5658,1,All analyses were stratified by sex.
5659,2,"Univariate analysis revealed that out of 83 variables, 36 (43%) and 34 (41%) variables were positively or negatively associated (region of practical equivalence <= 5%) with TM use and TM willingness, respectively. "
5660,2,"The Bayesian model averaging analysis allowed us to identify 13 and 17 factors of TM use and TM willingness, respectively. "
5661,2,"Among these factors, being female, having very poor knowledge of TM, treating <500 patients per quarter, and not being willing to use TM were negatively associated with TM use, whereas having good knowledge of TM and treating >1000 patients per quarter were positively associated with TM use. "
5662,2,"In addition, being aged 51 to 60 years, thinking that TM is not important for current and future work, and not currently using TM were negatively associated with TM willingness, whereas owning a smart device and working in an urban area were positively associated with TM willingness."
5663,3,The results point to the close connection between health care professionals' knowledge of TM and actual TM use. 
5664,3,These results lend support to the integration of digital competencies into medical education as well as hands-on training for health care professionals. 
5665,3,Incentive programs for physicians aged >50 years and practicing in rural areas could further encourage TM willingness.
5666,4,Interventions Including Smart Technology Compared With Face-to-face Physical Activity Interventions in Older Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
5667,0,This is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis comparing smart technology with face-to-face physical activity (PA) interventions in community-dwelling older adults (mean age 60 years).
5668,1,"We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED electronic databases from inception to February 2021. "
5669,1,"Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts and performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. "
5670,1,"The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation was used to evaluate the quality of the evidence. "
5671,1,"We provided a narrative synthesis on all included studies and, where possible, performed meta-analyses for similar outcomes."
5672,2,This review included 19 studies with a total of 3455 participants. 
5673,2,"Random effects meta-analyses showed that interventions with smart technology components resulted in improved step count (mean difference 1440 steps, 95% CI 500-2390) and total PA (standardized mean difference 0.17, 95% CI 0.02-0.32) compared with face-to-face alone. "
5674,2,There was no difference between groups in terms of the measures of physical function. 
5675,2,Smart technology alone did not show significant differences between groups in any outcome. 
5676,2,"The quality of the evidence was very low based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria."
5677,3,"Interventions that include smart technology may improve daily step counts by an average of 1440 steps in community-dwelling older adults; however, the quality of the evidence was very low. "
5678,3,Future studies are needed to improve the certainty of these results.
5679,4,Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Postsecondary Students: Randomized Factorial Trial for Examining Motivational Interviewing and Booster Lessons
5680,0,"Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) can improve access to mental health care for students, although high attrition rates are concerning and little is known about long-term outcomes. "
5681,0,Motivational interviewing (MI) exercises and booster lessons can improve engagement and outcomes in face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy.
5682,1,"In this factorial trial (factor 1: web-based MI before treatment; factor 2: self-guided booster lesson 1 month after treatment), 308 clients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment conditions, with 277 (89.9%) clients starting treatment. "
5683,1,All clients received a 5-week transdiagnostic ICBT course (the UniWellbeing course). 
5684,1,"Primary outcomes included changes in depression, anxiety, and perceived academic functioning from before treatment to after treatment and at the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups."
5685,2,"Overall, 54% (150/277) of students completed treatment and reported large improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety and small improvements in academic functioning after treatment, which were maintained at the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. "
5686,2,"Pretreatment MI did not contribute to better treatment completion or engagement, although small between-group effects favored MI for reductions in depression (Cohen d=0.23) and anxiety (Cohen d=0.25) after treatment. "
5687,2,Only 30.9% (43/139) of students randomized to one of the booster conditions accessed the booster. 
5688,2,"Overall, no main effects were found for the booster. "
5689,2,Subanalyses revealed that clients who accessed the booster had larger decreases in depressive symptoms (Cohen d=0.31) at the 3-month follow-up. 
5690,2,No interactions were found between MI and the booster.
5691,3,"Rather than offering MI before treatment, clients may experience more benefits from MI exercises later in ICBT when motivation wanes. "
5692,3,The low uptake of the self-guided booster limited our conclusions regarding its effectiveness. 
5693,3,"Future research should examine offering a booster for a longer duration after treatment, with therapist support and a longer follow-up period."
5694,4,"Automated Extraction of Diagnostic Criteria From Electronic Health Records for Autism Spectrum Disorders: Development, Evaluation, and Application"
5695,0,"Electronic health records (EHRs) with large sample sizes and rich information offer great potential for dementia research, but current methods of phenotyping cognitive status are not scalable."
5696,1,"In this diagnostic study, we developed and evaluated a semiautomated NLP-powered annotation tool (NAT) to facilitate phenotyping of cognitive status. "
5697,1,"Clinical experts adjudicated the cognitive status of 627 patients at Mass General Brigham (MGB) health care, using NAT or traditional chart reviews. "
5698,1,"Patient charts contained EHR data from two data sets: (1) records from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, for 100 Medicare beneficiaries from the MGB Accountable Care Organization and (2) records from 2 years prior to COVID-19 diagnosis to the date of COVID-19 diagnosis for 527 MGB patients. "
5699,1,"All EHR data from the relevant period were extracted; diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory test values were processed and summarized; clinical notes were processed through an NLP pipeline; and a web tool was developed to present an integrated view of all data. "
5700,1,"Cognitive status was rated as cognitively normal, cognitively impaired, or undetermined. "
5701,1,Assessment time and interrater agreement of NAT compared to manual chart reviews for cognitive status phenotyping was evaluated.
5702,2,"NAT adjudication provided higher interrater agreement (Cohen kappa=0.89 vs kappa=0.80) and significant speed up (time difference mean 1.4, SD 1.3 minutes; P<.001; ratio median 2.2, min-max 0.4-20) over manual chart reviews. "
5703,2,There was moderate agreement with manual chart reviews (Cohen kappa=0.67). 
5704,2,"In the cases that exhibited disagreement with manual chart reviews, NAT adjudication was able to produce assessments that had broader clinical consensus due to its integrated view of highlighted relevant information and semiautomated NLP features."
5705,3,NAT adjudication improves the speed and interrater reliability for phenotyping cognitive status compared to manual chart reviews. 
5706,3,This study underscores the potential of an NLP-based clinically adjudicated method to build large-scale dementia research cohorts from EHRs.
5707,4,Technology-Delivered Adaptations of Motivational Interviewing for the Prevention and Management of Chronic Diseases: Scoping Review
5708,0,Motivational interviewing (MI) can increase health-promoting behaviors and decrease health-damaging behaviors. 
5709,0,"However, MI is often resource intensive, precluding its use with people with limited financial or time resources. "
5710,0,Mobile health-based versions of MI interventions or technology-delivered adaptations of MI (TAMIs) might increase reach.
5711,1,We employed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews to conduct our scoping review. 
5712,1,"We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo from January 1, 1996, to April 6, 2022, to identify studies that described interventions incorporating MI into a mobile or electronic health platform. "
5713,1,"For inclusion, the study was required to (1) describe methods/outcomes of an MI intervention, (2) feature an intervention delivered automatically via a mobile or electronic health platform, and (3) report a behavioral or health outcome. "
5714,1,"The exclusion criteria were (1) publication in a language other than English and (2) description of only in-person intervention delivery (ie, no TAMI). "
5715,1,We charted results using Excel (Microsoft Corp).
5716,2,Thirty-four studies reported the use of TAMIs. 
5717,2,Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 2069 participants aged 13 to 70 years. 
5718,2,Most studies (n=27) directed interventions toward individuals engaging in behaviors that increased chronic disease risk. 
5719,2,"Most studies (n=22) oversampled individuals from marginalized sociodemographic groups, but few (n=3) were designed specifically with marginalized groups in mind. "
5720,2,"TAMIs used text messaging (n=8), web-based intervention (n=22), app + text messaging (n=1), and web-based intervention + text messaging (n=3) as delivery platforms. "
5721,2,"Of the 34 studies, 30 (88%) were randomized controlled trials reporting behavioral and health-related outcomes, 23 of which reported statistically significant improvements in targeted behaviors with TAMI use. "
5722,2,TAMIs improved targeted health behaviors in the remaining 4 studies. 
5723,2,"Moreover, 11 (32%) studies assessed TAMI feasibility, acceptability, or satisfaction, and all rated TAMIs highly in this regard. "
5724,2,"Among 20 studies with a disproportionately high number of people from marginalized racial or ethnic groups compared with the general US population, 16 (80%) reported increased engagement in health behaviors or better health outcomes. "
5725,2,"However, no TAMIs included elements that addressed sociocontextual influences on behavior or health outcomes."
5726,3,Our findings suggest that TAMIs may improve some health promotion and disease management behaviors. 
5727,3,"However, few TAMIs were designed specifically for people from marginalized sociodemographic groups, and none included elements to help address sociocontextual challenges. "
5728,3,"Research is needed to determine how TAMIs affect individual health outcomes and how to incorporate elements that address sociocontextual factors, and to identify the best practices for implementing TAMIs into clinical practice."
5729,4,"The Interplay of Work, Digital Health Usage, and the Perceived Effects of Digitalization on Physicians Work: Network Analysis Approach"
5730,0,"In health care, the benefits of digitalization need to outweigh the risks, but there is limited knowledge about the factors affecting this balance in the work environment of physicians. "
5731,0,"To achieve the benefits of digitalization, a more comprehensive understanding of this complex phenomenon related to the digitalization of physicians' work is needed."
5732,1,"A representative sample of 4630 (response rate 24.46%) Finnish physicians (2960/4617, 64.11% women) was used. "
5733,1,"Statements measuring the perceived effects of digitalization on work included the patients' active role, preventive work, interprofessional cooperation, decision support, access to patient information, and faster consultations. "
5734,1,Network analysis of the perceived effects of digitalization and factors related to work and digital health usage was conducted using mixed graphical modeling. 
5735,1,Adjusted and standardized regression coefficients are denoted by b. 
5736,1,Centrality statistics were examined to evaluate the relative influence of each variable in terms of node strength.
5737,2,"Nearly half of physicians considered that digitalization has promoted an active role for patients in their own care (2104/4537, 46.37%) and easier access to patient information (1986/4551, 43.64%), but only 1 in 10 (445/4529, 9.82%) felt that the impact has been positive on consultation times with patients. "
5738,2,"Almost half of the respondents estimated that digitalization has neither increased nor decreased the possibilities for preventive work (2036/4506, 45.18%) and supportiveness of clinical decision support systems (1941/4458, 43.54%). "
5739,2,"When all variables were integrated into the network, the most influential variables were purpose of using health information systems, employment sector, and specialization status. "
5740,2,"However, the grade given to the electronic health record (EHR) system that was primarily used had the strongest direct links to faster consultations (b=0.32) and facilitated access to patient information (b=0.28). "
5741,2,At least 6 months of use of the main EHR was associated with facilitated access to patient information (b=0.18).
5742,3,The results highlight the complex interdependence of multiple factors associated with the perceived effects of digitalization on physicians' work. 
5743,3,It seems that a high-quality EHR system is critical for promoting smooth clinical practice. 
5744,3,"In addition, work-related factors may influence other factors that affect digital health success. "
5745,3,These factors should be considered when developing and implementing new digital health technologies or services for physicians' work. 
5746,3,The adoption of digital health is not just a technological project but a project that changes existing work practices.
5747,4,Impacts of Digital Care Programs for Musculoskeletal Conditions on Depression and Work Productivity: Longitudinal Cohort Study
5748,0,"Comorbidity between musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and depression is highly common, and is associated with a greater symptom burden and greater loss of work productivity than either condition alone. "
5749,0,Multimodal care programs tackling both physical and mental health components may maximize productivity recovery and return to work. 
5750,0,"Digital delivery of such programs can facilitate access, ensure continuity of care, and enhance patient engagement."
5751,1,"Ad hoc analysis of an interventional, single-arm, cohort study of individuals with MSK pain undergoing a DCP was performed. "
5752,1,"Three subgroups with different baseline depression severity levels were established based on responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): cluster 1 (score<5: minimal depression), cluster 2 (scores 5-10: mild depression), and cluster 3 (score=10: moderate depression). "
5753,1,"The mean changes in depression, anxiety, fear-avoidance beliefs, work productivity, and activity impairment and adherence between baseline and end of program (8-12 weeks) were assessed across subgroups by latent growth curve analysis."
5754,2,"From a total of 7785 eligible participants, 6137 (78.83%) were included in cluster 1, 1158 (14.87%) in cluster 2, and 490 (6.29%) in cluster 3. "
5755,2,"Significant improvements in depression and anxiety scores were observed in clusters 2 and 3 but not in cluster 1, with average end-of-the program scores in clusters 2 and 3 below the initially defined cluster thresholds (score of 5 and 10, respectively). "
5756,2,"All clusters reported significant improvements in productivity impairment scores (mean changes from -16.82, 95% CI -20.32 to -13.42 in cluster 1 to -20.10, 95% CI -32.64 to -7.57 in cluster 3). "
5757,2,"Higher adherence was associated with higher improvements in depression in clusters 2 and 3, and with greater recovery in activities of daily living in cluster 3. "
5758,2,Overall patient satisfaction was 8.59/10.0 (SD 1.74).
5759,3,"A multimodal DCP was able to promote improvements in productivity impairment scores comparable to those previously reported in the literature, even in participants with comorbid depression and anxiety. "
5760,3,These results reinforce the need to follow a biopsychosocial framework to optimize outcomes in patients with MSK pain.
5761,4,"The Dose Response Effects of Digital HIV Care Navigation on Mental Health and Viral Suppression Among Young People Living With HIV: Single-Arm, Prospective Study With a Pre-Post Design"
5762,0,"The HIV epidemic has revealed considerable disparities in health among sexual and gender minorities of color within the Unites States, disproportionately affecting cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and trans women. "
5763,0,"Social inequities further disadvantage those with intersectional identities through homophobia, antitrans discrimination, and racism, shaping not only those at risk for HIV infection but also HIV prevention and care outcomes. "
5764,0,"Digital interventions have great potential to address barriers and improve HIV care among cisgender MSM and trans women; however, efficacy of digital HIV care interventions vary and need further examination."
5765,1,"This study had a single-arm, prospective, pre-post design. "
5766,1,"Eligibility criteria for the study included the following: identifying as cisgender MSM or trans women, being between the ages of 18 and 34 years, being newly diagnosed with HIV, or not being engaged or retained in HIV care or having a detectable viral load. "
5767,1,"We assessed and analyzed sociodemographics, intervention exposure, and HIV care and mental health outcome data for participants who completed the 6-month Health eNav intervention. "
5768,1,"We assessed all outcomes using generalized estimating equations to account for within-subjects correlation, and marginal effects of texting engagement on all outcomes were calculated over the entire 12-month study period. "
5769,1,"Finally, we specified an interaction between texting engagement and time to evaluate the effects of texting engagement on outcomes."
5770,2,"Over the entire 12-month period, this study shows that every one-text increase in engagement was associated with an increased odds of undetectable viral load (adjusted odds ratio 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02; P=.03). "
5771,2,"Mean negative mental health experiences decreased significantly at 12 months compared to baseline for every one-text increase in engagement (coefficient on interaction term 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99; P<.01)."
5772,3,"Digital care navigation interventions including Health eNav may be a critical component in the health delivery service system as the digital safety net for those whose social vulnerability is exacerbated in times of crisis, disasters, or global pandemics owing to multiple social inequities. "
5773,3,We found that increased engagement in a digital HIV care navigation intervention helped improve viral suppression and mental health-intersecting comorbid conditions-6 months after the intervention concluded. 
5774,3,"Digital care navigation may be a promising, effective, sustainable, and scalable intervention."
5775,4,Establishing Institutional Scores With the Rigor and Transparency Index: Large-scale Analysis of Scientific Reporting Quality
5776,0,"Improving rigor and transparency measures should lead to improvements in reproducibility across the scientific literature; however, the assessment of measures of transparency tends to be very difficult if performed manually."
5777,1,The RTI tracks 27 entity types using natural language processing techniques such as Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Conditional Random Field-based models and regular expressions; this allowed us to assess over 2 million papers accessed through PubMed Central.
5778,2,"Between 1997 and 2020 (where data were readily available in our data set), rigor and transparency measures showed general improvement (RTI 2.29 to 4.13), suggesting that authors are taking the need for improved reporting seriously. "
5779,2,"The top-scoring journals in 2020 were the Journal of Neurochemistry (6.23), British Journal of Pharmacology (6.07), and Nature Neuroscience (5.93). "
5780,2,We extracted the institution and country of origin from the author affiliations to expand our analysis beyond journals. 
5781,2,"Among institutions publishing >1000 papers in 2020 (in the PubMed Central open access set), Capital Medical University (4.75), Yonsei University (4.58), and University of Copenhagen (4.53) were the top performers in terms of RTI. "
5782,2,"In country-level performance, we found that Ethiopia and Norway consistently topped the RTI charts of countries with 100 or more papers per year. "
5783,2,"In addition, we tested our assumption that the RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability (ie, a high RTI represents papers containing sufficient information for replication efforts). "
5784,2,"Using work by the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, we determined that replication papers (RTI 7.61, SD 0.78) scored significantly higher (P<.001) than the original papers (RTI 3.39, SD 1.12), which according to the project required additional information from authors to begin replication efforts."
5785,3,These results align with our view that RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability. 
5786,3,"Unfortunately, RTI measures for journals, institutions, and countries fall short of the replicated paper average. "
5787,3,"If we consider the RTI of these replication studies as a target for future manuscripts, more work will be needed to ensure that the average manuscript contains sufficient information for replication attempts."
5788,4,Disparity and Factors Associated With Internet Health Information Seeking Among US Adults Living With Diabetes Mellitus: Cross-sectional Study
5789,0,Many patients with chronic medical conditions search the internet to obtain medical advice and health information to improve their health condition and quality of life. 
5790,0,Diabetes is a common chronic disease that disproportionately affects different race and ethnicity groups in the United States. 
5791,0,"In the existing literature on the popularity of internet health information seeking among persons with a chronic medical condition, there are limited data on US adults living with diabetes."
5792,1,We conducted a cross-sectional study using the Health Information National Trends Survey data from 2017 to 2020. 
5793,1,"We selected our study sample based on respondents' reports on whether they were told they had diabetes, and our primary outcome was internet health information-seeking behavior. "
5794,1,We used 2 multivariable logistic regression models to examine the effects of sociodemographic factors and other covariates on the internet health information-seeking behavior of adults with diabetes. 
5795,1,Jackknife replicate weights were used to provide bias-corrected variance estimates.
5796,2,Our study sample included 2903 adults who self-reported that they had diabetes. 
5797,2,"In total, 60.08% (1744/2903) were non-Hispanic White individuals, 46.88% (1336/2850) were men, and 64% (1812/2831) had some college or graduate education. "
5798,2,"The prevalence of internet health information seeking in this population was 64.49% (1872/2903), and the main factors associated with internet health information seeking included education level (some college vs less than high school: odds ratio [OR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.44-1.88; and college graduate or higher vs less than high school: OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.79-3.50), age (age group >= 65 years vs age group 18-44 years: OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34-0.63), and household income level (P<.001). "
5799,2,"In addition, we found significant differences in the effects of predictors stratified by race."
5800,3,The findings from this study suggest that internet health information seeking is common among US adults living with diabetes. 
5801,3,Internet health information could influence the relationship between health care providers and adults living with diabetes and improve their self-management and quality of life.
5802,4,Research on Digital Technology Use in Cardiology: Bibliometric Analysis
5803,0,Digital technology uses in cardiology have become a popular research focus in recent years. 
5804,0,"However, there has been no published bibliometric report that analyzed the corresponding academic literature in order to derive key publishing trends and characteristics of this scientific area."
5805,1,The Web of Science electronic database was queried to identify relevant papers on digital technology uses in cardiology. 
5806,1,Publication and citation data were acquired directly from the database. 
5807,1,"Complete bibliographic data were exported to VOSviewer, a dedicated bibliometric software package, and related to the semantic content of titles, abstracts, and keywords. "
5808,1,A term map was constructed for findings visualization.
5809,2,"The analysis was based on data from 12,529 papers. "
5810,2,"Of the top 5 most productive institutions, 4 were based in the United States. "
5811,2,"The United States was the most productive country (4224/12,529, 33.7%), followed by United Kingdom (1136/12,529, 9.1%), Germany (1067/12,529, 8.5%), China (682/12,529, 5.4%), and Italy (622/12,529, 5.0%). "
5812,2,"Cardiovascular diseases that had been frequently investigated included hypertension (152/12,529, 1.2%), atrial fibrillation (122/12,529, 1.0%), atherosclerosis (116/12,529, 0.9%), heart failure (106/12,529, 0.8%), and arterial stiffness (80/12,529, 0.6%). "
5813,2,"Recurring modalities were electrocardiography (170/12,529, 1.4%), angiography (127/12,529, 1.0%), echocardiography (127/12,529, 1.0%), digital subtraction angiography (111/12,529, 0.9%), and photoplethysmography (80/12,529, 0.6%). "
5814,2,"For a literature subset on smartphone apps and wearable devices, the Journal of Medical Internet Research (20/632, 3.2%) and other JMIR portfolio journals (51/632, 8.0%) were the major publishing venues."
5815,3,"Digital technology uses in cardiology target physicians, patients, and the general public. "
5816,3,"Their functions range from assisting diagnosis, recording cardiovascular parameters, and patient education, to teaching laypersons about cardiopulmonary resuscitation. "
5817,3,"This field already has had a great impact in health care, and we anticipate continued growth."
5818,4,Training Resources Targeting Social Media Skills to Inform Rehabilitation for People Who Have an Acquired Brain Injury: Scoping Review
5819,0,"In 2020 and 2021, people increasingly used the internet to connect socially and professionally. "
5820,0,"However, people with an acquired brain injury (ABI) experience challenges in using social media, and rehabilitation professionals have reported feeling underprepared to support them in its use. "
5821,0,"To date, no review of social media skills training to inform ABI rehabilitation has been conducted."
5822,1,"An integrative scoping review was conducted, with a systematic search strategy applied in March and November 2020 across OvidSP (MEDLINE, AMED, PsycINFO, and Embase), Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Google, and Facebook. "
5823,1,The data collected were critically appraised and synthesized to describe the key content and features of social media training resources.
5824,2,"This review identified 47 peer-reviewed academic articles, 48 social media training websites, and 120 online support groups for people with ABI. "
5825,2,"A key recommendation was interactive training with practical components addressing cybersafety, how to use platforms, and how to connect with others. "
5826,2,"However, no social media training resources that were relevant and accessible for people with ABI were identified."
5827,3,Training resources to support people with ABI in safely using social media are limited. 
5828,3,"The key content to be addressed and the features to be incorporated into web-based social media training were determined, including the need for interactive training that is co-designed and safe and incorporates practical components that support people with ABI. "
5829,3,These findings can be used to inform the development of web-based evidence-based support for people with ABI who may be vulnerable when participating in social media.
5830,4,Tracking Public Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccination on Tweets in Canada: Using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
5831,0,The development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines have generated optimism for the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and a return to normalcy. 
5832,0,"However, vaccine hesitancy, often fueled by misinformation, poses a major barrier to achieving herd immunity."
5833,1,"We applied a weakly supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) technique, which involves the human-in-the-loop system, on COVID-19 vaccination-related tweets in Canada. "
5834,1,Automatically generated aspect and opinion terms were manually corrected by public health experts to ensure the accuracy of the terms and make them more domain-specific. 
5835,1,"Then, based on these manually corrected terms, the system inferred sentiments toward the aspects. "
5836,1,"We observed sentiments toward key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination, and investigated how sentiments toward ""vaccination"" changed over time. "
5837,1,"In addition, we analyzed the most retweeted or liked tweets by observing most frequent nouns and sentiments toward key aspects."
5838,2,"After applying the ABSA system, we obtained 170 aspect terms (eg, ""immunity"" and ""pfizer"") and 6775 opinion terms (eg, ""trustworthy"" for the positive sentiment and ""jeopardize"" for the negative sentiment). "
5839,2,"While manually verifying or editing these terms, our public health experts selected 20 key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination for analysis. "
5840,2,"The sentiment analysis results for the 20 key aspects revealed negative sentiments related to ""vaccine distribution,"" ""side effects,"" ""allergy,"" ""reactions,"" and ""anti-vaxxer,"" and positive sentiments related to ""vaccine campaign,"" ""vaccine candidates,"" and ""immune response."" These results indicate that the Twitter users express concerns about the safety of vaccines but still consider vaccines as the option to end the pandemic. "
5841,2,"In addition, compared to the sentiment of the remaining tweets, the most retweeted or liked tweets showed more positive sentiment overall toward key aspects (P<.001), especially vaccines (P<.001) and vaccination (P=.009). "
5842,2,"Further investigation of the most retweeted or liked tweets revealed two opposing trends in Twitter users who showed negative sentiments toward vaccines: the ""anti-vaxxer"" population that used negative sentiments as a means to discourage vaccination and the ""Covid Zero"" population that used negative sentiments to encourage vaccinations while critiquing the public health response."
5843,3,Our study examined public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination on tweets over an extended period in Canada. 
5844,3,Our findings could inform public health agencies to design and implement interventions to promote vaccination.
5845,4,Effectiveness of Unguided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and the Three Good Things Exercise for Insomnia: 3-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial
5846,0,"The treatment of insomnia with sleep medication causes problems such as long-term use, dependence, and significant economic losses, including medical expenses. "
5847,0,Evidence-based lifestyle guidance is required to improve insomnia symptoms not only in person but also in easy-to-use web-based formats.
5848,1,"A 4-week program was implemented, and participants were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 groups. "
5849,1,The primary outcome measure was the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI) score at 4 weeks compared with baseline.
5850,2,"Of the 21,394 individuals invited to participate, 312 (1.46%) met the eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups. "
5851,2,"Of these 312 individuals, 270 (86.5%; ICBT 79/270, 29.3%; TGT 88/270, 32.6%; and WLC 103/270, 38.1%) completed a postintervention survey at 4 and 8 weeks. "
5852,2,"The adjusted mean changes of the primary outcome measure (PSQI) in the ICBT (-1.56, 95% CI -2.52 to -0.59; P<.001) and TGT (-1.15, 95% CI -2.08 to -0.23; P=.002) groups at 4 weeks from baseline showed a significant improvement compared with the WLC group. "
5853,2,"The adjusted mean changes in the secondary outcome measures of sleep onset latency, total sleep time, Athens Insomnia Scale score, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score at 4 weeks from baseline, as well as in the PSQI at 8 weeks from baseline, showed significant improvement for ICBT. "
5854,2,"Moreover, total sleep time, Athens Insomnia Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores at 4 weeks from baseline showed a significant improvement in the TGT group compared with the WLC group."
5855,3,A total of 4 weeks of unguided ICBT and TGT exercises improved insomnia.
5856,4,"Long-term Effectiveness of a Smartphone App Combined With a Smart Band on Weight Loss, Physical Activity, and Caloric Intake in a Population With Overweight and Obesity (Evident 3 Study): Randomized Controlled Trial"
5857,0,"Multicomponent mobile health approaches can improve lifestyle intervention results, although little is known about their long-term effectiveness."
5858,1,"We conducted a randomized controlled, multicenter clinical trial (Evident 3). "
5859,1,"A total of 650 participants were recruited from 5 primary care centers, with 318 participants in the intervention group (IG) and 332 in the control group (CG). "
5860,1,All participants were briefly counseled about a healthy diet and physical activity at the baseline visit. 
5861,1,"For the 3-month intervention period, the IG received training to use the app to promote healthy lifestyles and the smart band (Mi Band 2, Xiaomi). "
5862,1,All measurements were performed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months Physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. 
5863,1,Nutritional habits were assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire and Adherence to Mediterranean diet questionnaire.
5864,2,"Of the 650 participants included, 563 (86.6%) completed the 3-month visit and 443 (68.2%) completed the 12-month visit. "
5865,2,"After 12 months, the IG showed net differences in weight (-0.26, 95% CI -1.21 to 0.70 kg; P=.02), BMI (-0.06, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.28 points; P=.01), waist-height ratio (-0.25, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.44; P=.03), body adiposity index (-0.33, 95% CI -0.77 to 0.11; P=.03), waist circumference (-0.48, 95% CI -1.62 to 0.66 cm, P=.04) and hip circumference (-0.69, 95% CI -1.62 to 0.25 cm; P=.03). "
5866,2,"Both groups lowered daily caloric intake and increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet, with no differences between the groups. "
5867,2,"The IG increased light physical activity time (32.6, 95% CI -30.3 to 95.04 min/week; P=.02) compared with the CG. "
5868,2,"Analyses by subgroup showed changes in body composition variables in women, people aged >50 years, and married people."
5869,3,"The low-intensity intervention of the Evident 3 study showed, in the IG, benefits in weight loss, some body composition variables, and time spent in light physical activity compared with the CG at 3 months, but once the devices were collected, the downward trend was not maintained at the 12-month follow-up. "
5870,3,No differences in nutritional outcomes were observed between the groups.
5871,4,Patients Perspectives on Transforming Clinical Trial Participation: Large Online Vignette-based Survey
5872,0,Patients' participation is crucial to the success of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 
5873,0,"However, recruiting and retaining patients in trials remain a challenge."
5874,1,This was a vignette-based survey. 
5875,1,Vignettes were case scenarios of real clinical trials assessing pharmacological treatments. 
5876,1,"These RCTs evaluated 6 prevalent chronic diseases (ie, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and endometriosis). "
5877,1,"Each vignette described (1) the RCT and characteristics of the treatment tested (ie, doses, administration routes) and (2) the trial procedures and different options (on-site or remotely) for how the trial was organized for informed consent, follow-up visits, and communication of results when the trial was completed. "
5878,1,"We recruited 628 participants from ComPaRe (www.compare.aphp.fr ), a French e-cohort of patients with chronic diseases. "
5879,1,The outcomes were the participants' preferences for the way the trial was organized (on-site or remotely) and their willingness to participate in the trial.
5880,2,"Of the 628 participants who answered the vignettes, 491 (78.2%) were female (median age 55 years), with different chronic diseases ranging from endometriosis in 59 of 491 (12%) patients to asthma in 133 of 628 (21.2%) patients. "
5881,2,"In addition, 38 (6.1%) participants wanted to provide informed consent and all trial visits on-site, 176 (28%) wished to participate in the trial entirely remotely, and 414 (65.9%) wanted to combine remote-based and hospital-based visits. "
5882,2,"Considering the trial as a whole, when the trial was organized in a way that the patients preferred, the median (Q1-Q3) likelihood of participation in the trial was 90% (80-100) versus 60% (30-80) if the trial followed the patients' nonpreferred model. "
5883,2,"Furthermore, 256 (40.8%) patients responded to open-ended questions expressing their experience with trial participation and visits to the hospital and providing suggestions for improvement. "
5884,2,The patients emphasized the need to personalize the way a trial is organized according to each patient's needs and conditions.
5885,3,There was a significant diversity in the participants' preferences. 
5886,3,Most participants preferred hybrid organization involving both on-site and remote visits. 
5887,3,Participants were more likely to participate in a trial organized according to their preferences.
5888,4,Best Practices and Lessons Learned for Action Research in eHealth Design and Implementation: Literature Review
5889,0,Action research (AR) is an established research framework to introduce change in a community following a cyclical approach and involving stakeholders as coresearchers in the process. 
5890,0,"In recent years, it has also been used for eHealth development. "
5891,0,"However, little is known about the best practices and lessons learned from using AR for eHealth development."
5892,1,A semisystematic review of 44 papers reporting on 40 different AR projects was conducted to identify the best practices and lessons learned in the research studies while accounting for the particular contextual setting and used AR approach.
5893,2,"Recommendations include paying attention to the training of stakeholders' academic skills, as well as the various roles and tasks of action researchers. "
5894,2,The studies also highlight the need for constant reflection and accessible dissemination suiting the target group.
5895,3,This literature review identified room for improvements regarding communicating and specifying the particular AR definition and applied approach.
5896,4,Quality of Life and Multilevel Contact Network Structures Among Healthy Adults in Taiwan: Online Participatory Cohort Study
5897,0,"People's quality of life diverges on their demographics, socioeconomic status, and social connections."
5898,1,"Our 4-wave, repeated measures of quality of life followed the brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF). "
5899,1,"In our regression analysis, we integrated these survey measures with key time-varying and multilevel network indices based on contact diaries."
5900,2,People's quality of life may decrease if their daily contacts contain high proportions of weak ties. 
5901,2,"In addition, people tend to perceive a better quality of life when their daily contacts are face-to-face or initiated by others or when they contact someone who is in a good mood or someone with whom they can discuss important life issues."
5902,3,Our findings imply that both functional and structural aspects of the social network play important but different roles in shaping people's quality of life.
5903,4,Risk of Accidents or Chronic Disorders From Improper Use of Mobile Phones: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
5904,0,"Mobile phone use has brought convenience, but the long or improper use of mobile phones can cause harm to the human body."
5905,1,"We systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for studies published prior to April 5, 2019; relevant reviews were also searched to identify additional studies. "
5906,1,A random-effects model was used to calculate the overall pooled estimates.
5907,2,"Mobile phone users had a higher risk of accidents (relative risk [RR] 1.37, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.55). "
5908,2,"Long-term use of mobile phones increased accident risk relative to nonuse or short-term use (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.70). "
5909,2,"Compared with nonuse, mobile phone use resulted in a higher risk for neoplasms (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14), eye diseases (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.23), mental health disorders (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.32), and headaches (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.32); the pooled risk of other chronic disorders was 1.20 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.59). "
5910,2,Subgroup analyses also confirmed the increased risk of accidents and chronic disorders.
5911,3,Improper use of mobile phones can harm the human body. 
5912,3,"While enjoying the convenience brought by mobile phones, people have to use mobile phones properly and reasonably."
5913,4,"Effectiveness of Digital Counseling Environments on Anxiety, Depression, and Adherence to Treatment Among Patients Who Are Chronically Ill: Systematic Review"
5914,0,Patients who are chronically ill need novel patient counseling methods to support their self-care at different stages of the disease. 
5915,0,"At present, knowledge of how effective digital counseling is at managing patients' anxiety, depression, and adherence to treatment seems to be fragmented, and the development of digital counseling will require a more comprehensive view of this subset of interventions."
5916,1,"Systematic searches of the EBSCO (CINAHL), PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were conducted in May 2019 and complemented in October 2020. "
5917,1,"The review considered studies that included adult patients aged >= 18 years with chronic diseases; interventions evaluating digital (mobile, web-based, and ubiquitous) counseling interventions; and anxiety, depression, and adherence to treatment, including clinical indicators related to adherence to treatment, as outcomes. "
5918,1,Methodological quality was assessed using the standardized Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies. 
5919,1,"As a meta-analysis could not be conducted because of considerable heterogeneity in the reported outcomes, narrative synthesis was used to synthesize the results."
5920,2,"Of the 2056 records screened, 20 (0.97%) randomized controlled trials, 4 (0.19%) pilot randomized controlled trials, and 2 (0.09%) quasi-experimental studies were included. "
5921,2,"Among the 26 included studies, 10 (38%) digital, web-based interventions yielded significantly positive effects on anxiety, depression, adherence to treatment, and the clinical indicators related to adherence to treatment, and another 18 (69%) studies reported positive, albeit statistically nonsignificant, changes among patients who were chronically ill. "
5922,2,The results indicate that an effective digital counseling environment comprises high-quality educational materials that are enriched with multimedia elements and activities that engage the participant in self-care. 
5923,2,"Because of the methodological heterogeneity of the included studies, it is impossible to determine which type of digital intervention is the most effective for managing anxiety, depression, and adherence to treatment."
5924,3,"This study provides compelling evidence that digital, web-based counseling environments for patients who are chronically ill are more effective than, or at least comparable to, standard counseling methods; this suggests that digital environments could complement standard counseling."
5925,4,A Mobile Intervention to Link Young Female Entertainment Workers in Cambodia to Health and Gender-Based Violence Services: Randomized Controlled Trial
5926,0,"Female entertainment workers (FEWs) in Cambodia experience a greater prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), psychological distress, substance abuse, and gender-based violence (GBV) than the general female population. "
5927,0,Reaching FEWs with health education and linking them to services has been difficult because of their hidden and stigmatized status.
5928,1,A randomized controlled trial was conducted between March 2018 and June 2019 in the capital city and 3 other provinces in Cambodia. 
5929,1,FEWs in the intervention arm received automated twice-weekly Short Message Service messages and voice messages with health information and direct links to outreach workers. 
5930,1,"The control group received the existing standard care, including free HIV and STI counseling and testing and a toll-free helpline staffed by trained counselors. "
5931,1,We used a stratified random sampling method to select participants from 5 study sites in the 4 selected provinces. 
5932,1,"Initially, we randomly selected 600 participants from a list of 4000 FEWs by age group (18-24 and 25-30 years) and study site using a random number generator and enrolled them in person. "
5933,1,"The primary outcome measures included self-reported HIV and STI testing, condom use, and contraceptive use assessed through a face-to-face structured interview. "
5934,1,"We also measured secondary outcomes, including contact with outreach workers, escorted referral service use, forced drinking, and GBV experiences. "
5935,1,"Intervention effects were modeled using repeated measures, multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression."
5936,2,A total of 1118 participants were recruited and enrolled in the study. 
5937,2,We included 218 FEWs in the intervention arm and 170 FEWs in the control arm in the per protocol analyses after removing 730 dropouts. 
5938,2,"Evidence of positive intervention effects was detected for the following secondary outcomes: contacting an outreach worker (at 30 weeks: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.29, 95% CI 1.28-8.47), receiving an escorted referral (at 30 weeks: AOR 2.86, 95% CI 1.09-7.52; at 60 weeks: AOR 8.15, 95% CI 1.65-40.25), and never being forced to drink at work (at 60 weeks: AOR 3.95, 95% CI 1.62-9.60). "
5939,2,"Over time, no significant differences between intervention and control groups were observed for any primary outcomes in the fully adjusted models."
5940,3,The Mobile Link intervention effectively connected FEWs with outreach workers and escorted referrals but did not show an effect on primary outcomes. 
5941,3,Reduced forced drinking at work was also significantly more extensive in the intervention group than in the control group. 
5942,3,Longer-term messaging may increase access to services and impact FEWs' health outcomes in the future.
5943,4,A Deep Residual U-Net Algorithm for Automatic Detection and Quantification of Ascites on Abdominopelvic Computed Tomography Images Acquired in the Emergency Department: Model Development and Validation
5944,0,"Detection and quantification of intra-abdominal free fluid (ie, ascites) on computed tomography (CT) images are essential processes for finding emergent or urgent conditions in patients. "
5945,0,"In an emergency department, automatic detection and quantification of ascites will be beneficial."
5946,1,"We developed 2D DLMs based on deep residual U-Net, U-Net, bidirectional U-Net, and recurrent residual U-Net (R2U-Net) algorithms to segment areas of ascites on abdominopelvic CT images. "
5947,1,"Based on segmentation results, the DLMs detected ascites by classifying CT images into ascites images and nonascites images. "
5948,1,The AI algorithms were trained using 6337 CT images from 160 subjects (80 with ascites and 80 without ascites) and tested using 1635 CT images from 40 subjects (20 with ascites and 20 without ascites). 
5949,1,The performance of the AI algorithms was evaluated for diagnostic accuracy of ascites detection and for segmentation accuracy of ascites areas. 
5950,1,"Of these DLMs, we proposed an AI algorithm with the best performance."
5951,2,"The segmentation accuracy was the highest for the deep residual U-Net model with a mean intersection over union (mIoU) value of 0.87, followed by U-Net, bidirectional U-Net, and R2U-Net models (mIoU values of 0.80, 0.77, and 0.67, respectively). "
5952,2,"The detection accuracy was the highest for the deep residual U-Net model (0.96), followed by U-Net, bidirectional U-Net, and R2U-Net models (0.90, 0.88, and 0.82, respectively). "
5953,2,The deep residual U-Net model also achieved high sensitivity (0.96) and high specificity (0.96).
5954,3,"We propose a deep residual U-Net-based AI algorithm for automatic detection and quantification of ascites on abdominopelvic CT scans, which provides excellent performance."
5955,4,"Older Adults Loneliness, Social Isolation, and Physical Information and Communication Technology in the Era of Ambient Assisted Living: A Systematic Literature Review"
5956,0,Loneliness and social isolation can have severe effects on human health and well-being. 
5957,0,Partial solutions to combat these circumstances in demographically aging societies have been sought from the field of information and communication technology (ICT).
5958,1,The data were collected from 7 bibliographic databases. 
5959,1,A preliminary search resulted in 1271 entries that were screened based on predefined inclusion criteria. 
5960,1,"The characteristics of the selected studies were coded, and the results were summarized to answer our research questions."
5961,2,The final data set consisted of 23 empirical studies. 
5962,2,"We found out that ICT solutions such as smart homes can help detect and predict loneliness and social isolation, and technologies such as robotic pets and some other social robots can help alleviate loneliness to some extent. "
5963,2,The main open-ended challenges across studies relate to the need for more robust study samples and study designs. 
5964,2,"Further, the reviewed studies report technology- and topic-specific open-ended challenges."
5965,3,"Technology can help assess older adults' loneliness and social isolation, and alleviate loneliness without direct interaction with other people. "
5966,3,"The results are highly relevant in the COVID-19 era, where various social restrictions have been introduced all over the world, and the amount of research literature in this regard has increased recently."
5967,4,Active Usage of Mobile Health Applications: Cross-sectional Study
5968,0,Mobile health applications are being increasingly used for people's health management. 
5969,0,The different uses of mobile health applications lead to different health outcomes. 
5970,0,"Although active usage of mobile health applications is shown to be linked to the effectiveness of mobile health services, the factors that influence people's active usage of mobile health applications are not well studied."
5971,1,"Grounded on the 3-factor theory, we proposed 10 attributes of mobile health applications that influence the active usage of mobile health applications through consumers' satisfaction and dissatisfaction. "
5972,1,"We classified these 10 attributes into 3 categories (ie, excitement attributes, performance attributes, and basic attributes). "
5973,1,"Using the survey method, 494 valid responses were collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling."
5974,2,"Our analysis results revealed that both consumer satisfaction (beta=0.351, t=6.299, P<.001) and dissatisfaction (beta=0.251, t=5.119, P<.001) significantly influenced active usage. "
5975,2,"With regard to the effect of attributes, excitement attributes (beta=0.525, t=12.861, P<.001) and performance attributes (beta=0.297, t=6.508, P<.001) positively influenced consumer satisfaction, while performance attributes (beta=-0.231, t=3.729, P<.001) and basic attributes (beta=-0.412, t=7.132, P<.001) negatively influenced consumer dissatisfaction. "
5976,2,The results of the analysis confirmed our proposed hypotheses.
5977,3,Our study provides a novel perspective to study the active usage of mobile health applications. 
5978,3,"By categorizing the attributes of mobile health applications into 3 categories, the differential effects of different attributes can be tested. "
5979,3,"Meanwhile, consumer satisfaction and dissatisfaction are confirmed to be independent from each other."
5980,4,"A Comparison of the Use of Smart Devices, Apps, and Social Media Between Adults With and Without Hearing Impairment: Cross-sectional Web-Based Study"
5981,0,"eHealth and social media could be of particular benefit to adults with hearing impairment, but it is unknown whether their use of smart devices, apps, and social media is similar to that of the general population."
5982,1,"We used data from a Dutch cohort, the National Longitudinal Study on Hearing. "
5983,1,Data were collected from September 2016 to April 2020 using a web-based questionnaire and speech-in-noise test. 
5984,1,The results from this test were used to categorize normal hearing and hearing impairment. 
5985,1,Outcomes were compared using (multiple) logistic regression models.
5986,2,Adults with impaired hearing (n=384) did not differ from normal hearing adults (n=341) in their use of a smartphone or tablet. 
5987,2,"They were less likely to make use of social media apps on a smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.48-0.92; P=.02). "
5988,2,Use of social media on all devices and use of other apps did not differ. 
5989,2,"Adults with hearing impairment were more likely to agree with using social media to stay in touch with family members (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.16-2.07; P=.003) and friends (age-adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01-1.81; P=.046). "
5990,2,"Furthermore, they were more likely to agree with using social media to perform their work (age-adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04-2.18; P=.03). "
5991,2,There were no differences in the experienced benefits from social media.
5992,3,The potential for eHealth is confirmed because adults with hearing impairment are not less likely to use smart devices than their normal hearing peers. 
5993,3,Adults with hearing impairment are less likely to use social media apps on a smart device but not less likely to use social media on all types of internet-connected devices. 
5994,3,This warrants further research on the types of social media platforms that adults with hearing impairment use and on the type of device on which they prefer to use social media. 
5995,3,"Given that participants with hearing impairment are more likely than their normal hearing peers to use social media to perform their work, use of social media may be seen as an opportunity to enhance vocational rehabilitation services for persons with hearing impairment."
5996,4,Clinical Efficacy and Psychological Mechanisms of an App-Based Digital Therapeutic for Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial
5997,0,"Current treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often yield suboptimal outcomes, partly because of insufficient targeting of underlying psychological mechanisms (eg, avoidance reinforcement learning). "
5998,0,"Mindfulness training (MT) has shown efficacy for anxiety; yet, widespread adoption has been limited, partly because of the difficulty in scaling in-person-based delivery. "
5999,0,"Digital therapeutics are emerging as potentially viable treatments; however, very few have been empirically validated."
6000,1,Individuals with GAD were recruited using social media advertisements and randomized during an in-person visit to receive treatment as usual (n=33) or treatment as usual+app-delivered MT (Unwinding Anxiety; n=32). 
6001,1,The latter was composed of 30 modules to be completed over a 2-month period. 
6002,1,Associated changes in outcomes were assessed using self-report questionnaires 1 and 2 months after treatment initiation.
6003,2,"We randomized 65 participants in this study, and a modified intent-to-treat approach was used for analysis. "
6004,2,The median number of modules completed by the MT group was 25.5 (IQR 17) out of 30; 46% (13/28) of the participants completed the program. 
6005,2,"In addition, the MT group demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety (GAD-7) compared with the control group at 2 months (67% vs 14%; median change in GAD-7: -8.5 [IQR 6.5] vs -1.0 [IQR 5.0]; P<.001; 95% CI 6-10). "
6006,2,Increases in mindfulness at 1 month (nonreactivity subscale) mediated decreases in worry at 2 months (Penn State Worry Questionnaire; P=.02) and decreases in worry at 1 month mediated reductions in anxiety at 2 months (P=.03).
6007,3,"To our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficacy and mechanism of an app-delivered MT for GAD. "
6008,3,These findings demonstrate the clinical efficacy of MT as a digital therapeutic for individuals with anxiety (number needed to treat=1.6). 
6009,3,"These results also link recent advances in our mechanistic understanding of anxiety with treatment development, showing that app-delivered MT targets key reinforcement learning pathways, resulting in tangible, clinically meaningful reductions in worry and anxiety. "
6010,3,"Evidence-based, mechanistically targeted digital therapeutics have the potential to improve health at a population level at a low cost."
6011,4,Understanding the Relationship Between Official and Social Information About Infectious Disease: Experimental Analysis
6012,0,"Communicating official public health information about infectious diseases is complicated by the fact that individuals receive much of their information from their social contacts, either via interpersonal interaction or social media, which can be prone to bias and misconception."
6013,1,We used a series of experiments that exposed participants to both OI and structured SI about the symptoms and spread of hepatitis C over a series of 10 rounds of computer-based interactions. 
6014,1,"Participants were randomly assigned to receive a high, low, or control intensity of OI and to receive accurate or inaccurate SI about the disease."
6015,2,A total of 195 participants consented to participate in the study. 
6016,2,"Of these respondents, 186 had complete responses across all ten experimental rounds, which corresponds to a 4.6% (9/195) nonresponse rate. "
6017,2,The OI high intensity treatment increases learning over the control condition for all symptom and contagion questions when individuals have lower levels of baseline knowledge (all P values <=.04). 
6018,2,The accurate SI condition increased learning across experimental rounds over the inaccurate condition (all P values <=.01). 
6019,2,We find limited evidence of an interaction between official and SI about infectious diseases.
6020,3,This project demonstrates that exposure to official public health information increases individuals' knowledge of the spread and symptoms of a disease. 
6021,3,"Socially shared information also facilitates the learning of accurate and inaccurate information, though to a lesser extent than exposure to OI. "
6022,3,"Although the effect of OI persists, preliminary results suggest that it can be degraded by persistent contradictory SI over time."
6023,4,Recruiting Participants for Population Health Intervention Research: Effectiveness and Costs of Recruitment Methods for a Cohort Study
6024,0,Public health research studies often rely on population-based participation and draw on various recruitment methods to establish samples. 
6025,0,"Increasingly, researchers are turning to web-based recruitment tools. "
6026,0,"However, few studies detail traditional and web-based recruitment efforts in terms of costs and potential biases."
6027,1,"Over 2017 and 2018 in Vancouver, Saskatoon, and Montreal, the INTERACT study used the following recruitment methods: mailed letters, social media (including sponsored Facebook advertisements), news media, partner communications, snowball recruitment, in-person recruitment, and posters. "
6028,1,"Participation in the study involved answering web-based questionnaires (at minimum), activating a smartphone app to share sensor data, and wearing a device for mobility and physical activity monitoring. "
6029,1,"We describe sociodemographic characteristics by the recruitment method and analyze performance indicators, including cost, completion rate, and time effectiveness. "
6030,1,"Effectiveness included calculating cost per completer (ie, a participant who completed at least one questionnaire), the completion rate of a health questionnaire, and the delay between completion of eligibility and health questionnaires. "
6031,1,"Cost included producing materials (ie, printing costs), transmitting recruitment messages (ie, mailing list rental, postage, and sponsored Facebook posts charges), and staff time. "
6032,1,"In Montreal, the largest INTERACT sample, we modeled the number of daily recruits through generalized linear models accounting for the distributed lagged effects of recruitment campaigns."
6033,2,"Overall, 1791 participants were recruited from 3 cities and completed at least one questionnaire: 318 in Vancouver, 315 in Saskatoon, and 1158 in Montreal. "
6034,2,"In all cities, most participants chose to participate fully (questionnaires, apps, and devices). "
6035,2,The costs associated with a completed participant varied across recruitment methods and by city. 
6036,2,"Facebook advertisements generated the most recruits (n=687), at a cost of CAD $15.04 (US $11.57; including staff time) per completer. "
6037,2,"Mailed letters were the costliest, at CAD $108.30 (US $83.3) per completer but served to reach older participants. "
6038,2,"All methods resulted in a gender imbalance, with women participating more, specifically with social media. "
6039,2,Partner newsletters resulted in the participation of younger adults and were cost-efficient (CAD $5.16 [US $3.97] per completer). 
6040,2,"A generalized linear model for daily Montreal recruitment identified 2-day lag effects on most recruitment methods, except for the snowball campaign (4 days), letters (15 days), and reminder cards (5 days)."
6041,3,"This study presents comprehensive data on the costs, effectiveness, and bias of population recruitment in a cohort study in 3 Canadian cities. "
6042,3,More comprehensive documentation and reporting of recruitment efforts across studies are needed to improve our capacity to conduct inclusive intervention research.
6043,4,Mobile Diary App Versus Paper-Based Diary Cards for Patients With Borderline Personality Disorder: Economic Evaluation
6044,0,The cost-effectiveness of using a mobile diary app as an adjunct in dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in patients with borderline personality disorder is unknown.
6045,1,"This study was conducted alongside a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. "
6046,1,"The participants were recruited at 5 Danish psychiatric outpatient facilities and were randomized to register the emotions, urges, and skills used in a mobile diary app or on paper-based diary cards. "
6047,1,The participants in both groups received DBT delivered by the therapists. 
6048,1,A cost-consequence analysis with a time horizon of 12 months was performed. 
6049,1,"Consequences included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), depression severity, borderline severity, suicidal behavior, health care use, treatment compliance, and system usability. "
6050,1,All relevant costs were included. 
6051,1,"Focus group interviews were conducted with patients, therapists, researchers, and industry representatives to discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of using a mobile diary app."
6052,2,A total of 78 participants were included in the analysis. 
6053,2,An insignificantly higher number of participants in the paper group dropped out before the start of treatment (P=.07). 
6054,2,"Of those starting treatment, participants in the app group had an average of 37.1 (SE 27.55) more days of treatment and recorded an average of 3.16 (SE 5.10) more skills per week than participants in the paper group. "
6055,2,"Participants in both groups had a QALY gain and a decrease in depression severity, borderline severity, and suicidal behavior. "
6056,2,Significant differences were found in favor of the paper group for both QALY gain (adjusted difference -0.054; SE 0.03) and reduction in depression severity (adjusted difference -1.11; SE 1.57). 
6057,2,The between-group difference in total costs ranged from US $107.37 to US $322.10 per participant during the 12 months. 
6058,2,The use of services in the health care sector was similar across both time points and groups (difference: psychiatric hospitalization <5 and <5; general practice -1.32; SE 3.68 and 2.02; SE 3.19). 
6059,2,"Overall, the patients showed high acceptability and considered the app as being easy to use. "
6060,2,Therapists worried about potential negative influences on the therapist-patient interaction from new work tasks accompanying the introduction of the new technology but pointed at innovation potential from digital database registrations.
6061,3,This study suggests both positive and negative consequences of mobile diary apps as adjuncts to DBT compared with paper diary cards. 
6062,3,More research is needed to draw conclusions regarding its cost-effectiveness.
6063,4,Effectiveness of Telehealth in Rural and Remote Emergency Departments: Systematic Review
6064,0,Emergency telehealth has been used to improve access of patients residing in rural and remote areas to specialist care in the hope of mitigating the significant health disparities that they experience. 
6065,0,Patient disposition decisions in rural and remote emergency departments (EDs) can be complex and largely dependent on the expertise and experience available at local (receiving-end) hospitals. 
6066,0,"Although there has been some synthesis of evidence of the effectiveness of emergency telehealth in clinical practice in rural and remote EDs for nonacute presentations, there has been limited evaluation of the influence of contextual factors such as clinical area and acuity of presentation on these findings."
6067,1,"The search strategy used Medical Subject Headings and equivalent lists of subject descriptors to find articles covering 4 key domains: telehealth or telemedicine, EDs, effectiveness, and rural and remote. "
6068,1,"Studies were selected using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes of Interest, and Study Design framework. "
6069,1,"This search strategy was applied to MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL, ProQuest, and EconLit, as well as the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases (eg, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database) for the search period from January 1, 1990, to May 23, 2020. "
6070,1,"Qualitative synthesis was performed on the outcome measures used in the included studies, in particular the clinical contexts within which they were interpreted."
6071,2,A total of 21 full-text articles were included for qualitative analysis. 
6072,2,"Telehealth use in rural and remote EDs demonstrated effectiveness in achieving improved or equivalent clinical effectiveness, appropriate care processes, and-depending on the context-improvement in speed of care, as well as favorable service use patterns. "
6073,2,"The definition of effectiveness varied across the clinical areas and contexts of the studies, and different measures have been used to affirm the safety and clinical effectiveness of telehealth in rural and remote EDs. "
6074,2,"The acuity of patient presentation emerged as a dominant consideration in the interpretation of interlinking time-sensitive clinical effectiveness and patient disposition measures such as transfer and discharge rates, local hospital admission, length of stay, and ED length of stay. "
6075,2,"These, together with clinical area and acuity of presentation, are the outcome determination criteria that emerged from this review."
6076,3,Emergency telehealth studies typically use multiple outcome measures to determine the effectiveness of the services. 
6077,3,The outcome determination criteria that emerged from this analysis are useful when defining the favorable direction for each outcome measure of interest. 
6078,3,The findings of this review have implications for emergency telehealth service design and policies.
6079,4,Comparing the Impact of Online Ratings and Report Cards on Patient Choice of Cardiac Surgeon: Large Observational Study
6080,0,"Patients may use two information sources about a health care provider's quality: online physician reviews, which are written by patients to reflect their subjective experience, and report cards, which are based on objective health outcomes."
6081,1,"We obtained ratings from a leading physician review platform, Vitals; report card scores from Pennsylvania Cardiac Surgery Reports; and information about patients' choices of surgeons from inpatient records on coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries done in Pennsylvania from 2008 to 2017. "
6082,1,We scraped all reviews posted on Vitals for surgeons who performed CABG surgeries in Pennsylvania during our study period. 
6083,1,"We linked the average overall rating and the most recent report card score at the time of a patient's surgery to the patient's record based on the surgeon's name, focusing on fee-for-service patients to avoid impacts of insurance networks on patient choices. "
6084,1,We used random coefficient logit models with surgeon fixed effects to examine the impact of receiving a high online rating and a high report card score on patient choice of surgeon for CABG surgeries.
6085,2,"We found that a high online rating had positive and significant effects on patient utility, with limited variation in preferences across individuals, while the impact of a high report card score on patient choice was trivial and insignificant. "
6086,2,About 70.13% of patients considered no information on Vitals better than a low rating; the corresponding figure was 26.66% for report card scores. 
6087,2,"The findings were robust to alternative choice set definitions and were not explained by surgeon attrition, referral effect, or admission status. "
6088,2,"Our results also show that the interaction effect of rating information and a time trend was positive and significant for online ratings, but small and insignificant for report cards."
6089,3,"A patient's choice of surgeon is affected by both types of rating information; however, over the past decade, online ratings have become more influential, while the effect of report cards has remained trivial. "
6090,3,Our findings call for information provision strategies that incorporate the advantages of both online ratings and report cards.
6091,4,How Food Marketing on Instagram Shapes Adolescents Food Preferences: Online Randomized Trial
6092,0,"Worldwide obesity rates have prompted 16 countries to enact policies to reduce children's exposure to unhealthy food marketing, but few policies address online advertising practices or protect adolescents from being targeted. "
6093,0,"Given adolescents spend so much time online, it is critical to understand how persuasive Instagram food advertisements (ads) are compared with traditional food ads. "
6094,0,"To strengthen online food marketing policies, more evidence is needed on whether social media ads are more persuasive than other types of ads in shaping adolescents' preferences."
6095,1,"In Part 1, participants aged 13-17 years (N=832) viewed 8 pairs of ads and were asked to identify which ads originated from Instagram. "
6096,1,"One ad in each pair was selected from traditional sources (eg, print; online banner ad), and the other ad was selected from Instagram, but we removed the Instagram frame-which includes the logo, comments, and ""likes."" In Part 2, participants were randomized to rate food ads that ostensibly originated from (1) Instagram (ie, we photoshopped the Instagram frame onto ads); or (2) traditional sources. "
6097,1,"Unbeknownst to participants, half of the ads in their condition originated from Instagram and half originated from traditional sources."
6098,2,"In Part 1, adolescents performed worse than chance when asked to identify Instagram ads (P<.001). "
6099,2,"In Part 2, there were no differences on 4 of 5 outcomes in the ""labeled ad condition."" In the ""unlabeled ad condition,"" however, they preferred Instagram ads to traditional ads on 3 of 5 outcomes (ie, trendiness, P=.001; artistic appeal, P=.001; likeability, P=.001)."
6100,3,"Adolescents incorrectly identified traditional ads as Instagram posts, suggesting the artistic appearance of social media ads may not be perceived as marketing. "
6101,3,"Further, the mere presence of Instagram features caused adolescents to rate food ads more positively than ads without Instagram features."
6102,4,A Web-Based Intervention (Germ Defence) to Increase Handwashing During a Pandemic: Process Evaluations of a Randomized Controlled Trial and Public Dissemination
6103,0,Washing hands helps prevent transmission of seasonal and pandemic respiratory viruses. 
6104,0,"In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) during the swine flu outbreak, participants with access to a fully automated, digital intervention promoting handwashing reported washing their hands more often and experienced fewer respiratory tract infections than those without access to the intervention. "
6105,0,"Based on these findings, the intervention was adapted, renamed as ""Germ Defence,"" and a study was designed to assess the preliminary dissemination of the intervention to the general public to help prevent the spread of seasonal colds and flu."
6106,1,"The RCT ran between 2010 and 2012 recruiting participants offline from general practices, with restricted access to the intervention (N=9155). "
6107,1,Germ Defence was disseminated as an open access website for use by the general public from 2016 to 2019 (N=624). 
6108,1,The process evaluation plan was developed using Medical Research Council guidance and the framework for Analyzing and Measuring Usage and Engagement Data. 
6109,1,Both interventions contained a goal-setting section where users self-reported current and intended handwashing behavior across 7 situations.
6110,2,"During web-based enrolment, 54.3% (17,511/32,250) of the RCT participants dropped out of the study compared to 36.5% (358/982) of Germ Defence users. "
6111,2,"Having reached the start of the intervention, 93.8% (8586/9155) of RCT users completed the core section, whereas 65.1% (406/624) of Germ Defence users reached the same point. "
6112,2,"Users across both studies selected to increase their handwashing in 5 out of 7 situations, including before eating snacks (RCT mean difference 1.040, 95% CI 1.016-1.063; Germ Defence mean difference 0.949, 95% CI 0.766-1.132) and after blowing their nose, sneezing, or coughing (RCT mean difference 0.995, 95% CI 0.972-1.019; Germ Defence mean difference 0.842, 95% CI 0.675-1.008)."
6113,3,"By comparing the preliminary dissemination of Germ Defence to the RCT, we were able to examine the potential effects of the research procedures on uptake and attrition such as the sizeable dropout during the RCT enrolment procedure that may have led to a more motivated sample. "
6114,3,The Germ Defence study highlighted the points of attrition within the intervention. 
6115,3,"Despite sample bias in the trial context, the intervention replicated increases in intentions to handwash when used ""in the wild."" This preliminary dissemination study informed the adaptation of the intervention for the COVID-19 health emergency, and it has now been disseminated globally."
6116,4,"A Web-Based Integrated Management Program for Improving Medication Adherence and Quality of Life, and Reducing Readmission in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: Randomized Controlled Trial"
6117,0,Atrial fibrillation (AF) is related to a variety of chronic diseases and life-threatening complications. 
6118,0,"It is estimated that by 2050, there will be 72 million patients with AF in Asia, of which 2.9 million will have AF-associated stroke. "
6119,0,AF has become a major issue for health care systems.
6120,1,"The parallel-group, single-blind, prospective randomized controlled trial recruited patients with AF from a medical center in northern Taiwan and divided them randomly into intervention and control groups. "
6121,1,"Patients in the intervention group received the web-based integrated management program, whereas those in the control group received usual care. "
6122,1,"The measurement tools included the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) scale, Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS), the three-level version of the EuroQoL five-dimension self-report questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), and readmission events 2 years after initiating the intervention. "
6123,1,"Data were collected at 4 instances (baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after initiating the intervention), and analyzed with generalized estimating equations (GEEs)."
6124,2,A total of 231 patients were recruited and allocated into an intervention (n=115) or control (n=116) group. 
6125,2,The mean age of participants was 73.08 (SD 11.71) years. 
6126,2,"Most participants were diagnosed with paroxysmal AF (171/231, 74%), and the most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (162/231, 70.1%). "
6127,2,"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement in approach coping strategies, medication adherence, and HRQoL at 1, 3, and 6 months (all P<.05). "
6128,2,"In addition, the intervention group showed significantly fewer readmission events within 2 years (OR 0.406, P=.03), compared with the control group."
6129,3,The web-based integrated management program can significantly improve patients' coping strategy and medication adherence. 
6130,3,"Therefore, it can empower patients to maintain disease stability, which is a major factor in improving their HRQoL and reducing readmission events within 2 years."
6131,4,Roles of Psychosocial Factors on the Association Between Online Social Networking Use Intensity and Depressive Symptoms Among Adolescents: Prospective Cohort Study
6132,0,The potential mechanisms underlying the association between online social networking use intensity and depressive symptoms are unclear and underresearched.
6133,1,A total of 4237 adolescents from a 9-month longitudinal study were included. 
6134,1,"Score changes (indicated as Delta) for the social function use intensity (SFUI) and entertainment function use intensity (EFUI) subscales of the Online Social Networking Activity Intensity Scale and for friendship quality, perceived family support, perceived friend support, parent-adolescent conflict, social nonconfidence, and depressive symptoms were analyzed. "
6135,1,The potential mediation effects of unfavorable psychosocial factors and suppression effects of favorable psychosocial factors on the association of Delta SFUI with Delta CES-D and the association of Delta EFUI with Delta CES-D were tested using hierarchical regression models.
6136,2,"The association between Delta SFUI and Delta CES-D was partially mediated by Delta mother-adolescent conflict (mediation effect size 5.11%, P=.02) and Delta social nonconfidence (mediation effect size 20.97%, P<.001) but partially suppressed by.friendship quality, Delta perceived family support, and Delta perceived friend support, with suppression effects of -0.011 (P=.003), -0.009 (P=.003), and -0.022 (P<.001), respectively. "
6137,2,"The association between Delta EFUI and Delta CES-D was partially mediated by.social nonconfidence (mediation effect size 30.65%, P<.001) but partially suppressed by.perceived family support and Delta perceived friend support, with suppression effects of -0.036 (P<.001) and -0.039 (P<.001), respectively."
6138,3,"The association between online social networking use intensity and depressive symptoms was partially mediated through the indirect increase in social nonconfidence and mother-adolescent conflict; however, better perceived social support and friendship quality would partially compensate for the harmful impact of online social networking use intensity on depressive symptoms among early adolescents."
6139,4,The Effect of Reminiscence Therapy Using Virtual Reality on Apathy in Residential Aged Care: Multisite Nonrandomized Controlled Trial
6140,0,Apathy is a frequent and underrecognized neurological disorder symptom. 
6141,0,Reduced goal-directed behavior caused by apathy is associated with poor outcomes for older adults in residential aged care. 
6142,0,Recommended nonpharmacological treatments include person-centered therapy using information and communication technology. 
6143,0,Virtual reality (VR) in the form of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is a fully immersive technology that provides access to a wide range of freely available content. 
6144,0,The use of VR as a therapy tool has demonstrated promise in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety. 
6145,0,"In addition, VR has been used to improve conditions including depression, anxiety, cognitive function, and balance in older adults with memory deficits, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease. "
6146,0,Research using VR for the symptoms of apathy in older adults living in residential aged care facilities is limited.
6147,1,"In this multisite trial, 43 participants were allocated to one of three groups: reminiscence therapy intervention using VR in the form of HMDs, reminiscence therapy using a laptop computer supplemented by physical items if required (active control), and a usual care (passive control) group. "
6148,1,"The primary outcome was apathy, and the secondary outcomes included cognition and depression. "
6149,1,The side effects of using HMDs were also measured in the VR group.
6150,2,"Mixed model analyses revealed no significant group interaction over time in outcomes between the VR and laptop groups (estimate=-2.24, SE 1.89; t(40)=-1.18; P=.24). "
6151,2,"Pooled apathy scores in the two intervention groups compared with the passive control group also revealed no significant group interaction over time (estimate=-0.26, SE 1.66; t(40)=-0.16; P=.88). "
6152,2,There were no significant secondary outcomes. 
6153,2,"Most participants in the VR group stated that they would prefer to watch content in VR than on a flat screen (chi(2)(2)=11.2; P=.004), side effects from HMD use were negligible to minimal according to the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire cutoff scores."
6154,3,"Although there were no significant results in outcome measures, this study found that participants engaged in the research and enjoyed the process of reminiscing using both forms of technology. "
6155,3,It was found that VR can be implemented in an aged care setting with correct protocols in place. 
6156,3,Providing residents in aged care with a choice of technology may assist in increasing participation in activities. 
6157,3,"We cannot dismiss the importance of immediate effects while the therapy was in progress, and this is an avenue for future research."
6158,4,Identifying False Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Information and Corresponding Risk Perceptions From Twitter: Advanced Predictive Models
6159,0,The vaccination uptake rates of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remain low despite the fact that the effectiveness of HPV vaccines has been established for more than a decade. 
6160,0,Vaccine hesitancy is in part due to false information about HPV vaccines on social media. 
6161,0,Combating false HPV vaccine information is a reasonable step to addressing vaccine hesitancy.
6162,1,This study used machine learning and natural language processing to develop a series of classification models and causality mining methods to identify and examine true and false HPV vaccine-related information on Twitter.
6163,2,We found that the convolutional neural network model outperformed all other models in identifying tweets containing false HPV vaccine-related information (F score=91.95). 
6164,2,We also developed completely unsupervised causality mining models to identify HPV vaccine candidate effects for capturing risk perceptions of HPV vaccines. 
6165,2,"Furthermore, we found that false information contained mostly loss-framed messages focusing on the potential risk of vaccines covering a variety of topics using more diverse vocabulary, while true information contained both gain- and loss-framed messages focusing on the effectiveness of vaccines covering fewer topics using relatively limited vocabulary."
6166,3,Our research demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of using predictive models to identify false HPV vaccine information and its risk perceptions on social media.
6167,4,Adherence to Telemonitoring Therapy for Medicaid Patients With Hypertension: Case Study
6168,0,Almost 50% of the adults in the United States have hypertension. 
6169,0,"Although clinical trials indicate that home blood pressure monitoring can be effective in managing hypertension, the reported results might not materialize in practice because of patient adherence problems."
6170,1,This study targeted Medicaid patients with hypertension from the state of Texas. 
6171,1,A total of 180 days of blood pressure and pulse data in 2016-2018 from a telemonitoring company were analyzed for mean transmission rate and mean blood pressure change. 
6172,1,The first 30 days of data were excluded because of startup effects. 
6173,1,The protocols required the patients to transmit readings by a specified time daily. 
6174,1,Patients not transmitting their readings received an adherence reminder call to troubleshoot problems and encourage transmission. 
6175,1,The patients were classified into adherent and nonadherent cohorts; adherent patients were those who transmitted data on at least 80% of the days.
6176,2,The mean patient age was 73.2 (SD 11.7) years. 
6177,2,"Of the 823 patients, 536 (65.1%) were women, and 660 (80.2%) were urban residents. "
6178,2,"The adherent cohort (475/823, 57.7%) had mean transmission rates of 74.9% before the adherence reminder call and 91.3% after the call, whereas the nonadherent cohort (348/823, 42.3%) had mean transmission rates of 39% and 58% before and after the call, respectively. "
6179,2,"From month 1 to month 5, the transmission rates dropped by 1.9% and 10.2% for the adherent and nonadherent cohorts, respectively. "
6180,2,"The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values improved by an average of 2.2 and 0.7 mm Hg (P<.001 and P=.004), respectively, for the adherent cohort during the study period, whereas only the systolic blood pressure value improved by an average of 1.6 mm Hg (P=.02) for the nonadherent cohort."
6181,3,"Although we found that patients can achieve high levels of adherence, many experience adherence problems. "
6182,3,"Although adherence reminder calls help, they may not be sufficient. "
6183,3,"Telemonitoring lowered blood pressure, as has been observed in clinical trials. "
6184,3,"Furthermore, blood pressure control was positively associated with adherence."
6185,4,Using a Smartphone Application for the Accurate and Rapid Diagnosis of Acute Anterior Intracranial Arterial Occlusion: Usability Study
6186,0,Telestroke has developed rapidly as an assessment tool for patients eligible for reperfusion therapy.
6187,1,We retrospectively enrolled 108 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours of their stroke onset. 
6188,1,"Two vascular neurologists, blinded to all clinical information, independently evaluated magnetic resonance angiography and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images for the presence or absence of LVO in the internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery (M1, M2, or M3) on both a smartphone application (Smartphone-LVO) and a hospital-based desktop PC monitor (PC-LVO). "
6189,1,"To evaluate the accuracy of an arterial occlusion diagnosis, interdevice variability between Smartphone-LVO and PC-LVO was analyzed using. "
6190,1,"statistics, and image interpretation time was compared between Smartphone-LVO and PC-LVO."
6191,2,"There was broad agreement between Smartphone-LVO and PC-LVO evaluations regarding the presence or absence of arterial occlusion (Reader 1:kappa=0.94; P<.001 vs Reader 2:kappa=0.89; P<.001), and interpretation times were similar between Smartphone-LVO and PC-LVO."
6192,3,The results indicate the evaluation of neuroimages using a smartphone application can provide an accurate and timely diagnosis of anterior intracranial arterial occlusion that can be shared immediately with members of the stroke team to support the management of patients with hyperacute ischemic stroke.
6193,4,Obesity and BMI Cut Points for Associated Comorbidities: Electronic Health Record Study
6194,0,Studies have found associations between increasing BMIs and the development of various chronic health conditions. 
6195,0,"The BMI cut points, or thresholds beyond which comorbidity incidence can be accurately detected, are unknown."
6196,1,US adults aged 18-75 years who had >= 3 health care visits at an academic medical center from 2008 to 2016 were identified from eHealth records. 
6197,1,"Pregnant patients, patients with cancer, and patients who had undergone bariatric surgery were excluded. "
6198,1,"Quantile regression, with BMI as the outcome, was used to evaluate the associations between BMI and disease incidence. "
6199,1,A comorbidity was determined to have a cut point if the area under the receiver operating curve was >0.6. 
6200,1,The cut point was defined as the BMI value that maximized the Youden index.
6201,2,"We included 243,332 patients in the study cohort. "
6202,2,"The mean age and BMI were 46.8 (SD 15.3) years and 29.1 kg/m(2), respectively. "
6203,2,We found statistically significant associations between increasing BMIs and the incidence of all comorbidities except anxiety and cerebrovascular disease. 
6204,2,"Cut points were identified for hyperlipidemia (27.1 kg/m(2)), coronary artery disease (27.7 kg/m(2)), hypertension (28.4 kg/m(2)), osteoarthritis (28.7 kg/m(2)), obstructive sleep apnea (30.1 kg/m(2)), and type 2 diabetes (30.9 kg/m(2))."
6205,3,The BMI cut points that accurately predicted the risks of developing 6 obesity-related comorbidities occurred when patients were overweight or barely met the criteria for class 1 obesity. 
6206,3,"Further studies using national, longitudinal data are needed to determine whether screening guidelines for appropriate comorbidities may need to be revised."
6207,4,Content Analysis and Quality Evaluation of Cesarean Delivery-Related Videos on YouTube: Cross-sectional Study
6208,0,"YouTube is one of the most popular open-access video-sharing websites, and it is also used to obtain health care information. "
6209,0,Cesarean delivery is the most common major surgical intervention in many countries. 
6210,0,Videos related to cesarean delivery have also been uploaded to YouTube. 
6211,0,"However, no study has explored the overall quality of cesarean delivery videos on the platform."
6212,1,"We searched for a total of 18 terms by combining the 6 terms retrieved from Google AdWords and the 3 terms c section, cesarean section, and cesarean delivery, which are used interchangeably. "
6213,1,"Videos were sorted by view count, and the 100 videos with the highest view counts were chosen. "
6214,1,"The number of views, duration, likes and dislikes, content type, and source of each video were recorded. "
6215,1,"In evaluating the quality of the videos, we referred to a previous study. "
6216,1,"Additionally, we developed a detailed scoring method that comprehensively evaluates the videos related to cesarean delivery by including the necessary information for each element of the cesarean delivery and whether scientific evidence was presented."
6217,2,"Of the 100 videos analyzed, the most prevalent content (n=28) was videos that contained the actual surgical procedure of a cesarean delivery, and the most common source of cesarean delivery videos was physicians (n=30). "
6218,2,"Videos directly related to cesarean delivery, such as explanation of the surgery and the actual surgical procedure, were mainly uploaded by medical groups and scored higher than the videos indirectly related to cesarean delivery, which were mainly uploaded by nonmedical groups. "
6219,2,"In addition, videos directly related to cesarean delivery were more often uploaded earlier in time, with lower like ratios compared to indirect videos."
6220,3,YouTube is currently not an appropriate source for patients seeking information on cesarean delivery.
6221,4,A Health Information Quality Assessment Tool for Korean Online Newspaper Articles: Development Study
6222,0,Concern regarding the reliability and accuracy of the health-related information provided by online newspaper articles has increased. 
6223,0,"Numerous criteria and items have been proposed and published regarding the quality assessment of online information, but there is no standard quality assessment tool available for online newspapers."
6224,1,We reviewed previous health information quality assessment tools and related studies and accordingly developed and customized new criteria. 
6225,1,"The interrater agreement for the new assessment tool was assessed for 3 newspaper articles on different subjects (colorectal cancer, obesity genetic testing, and hypertension diagnostic criteria) using the Fleiss kappa and Gwet agreement coefficient. "
6226,1,"To compare the quality scores generated by each pair of tools, convergent validity was measured using the Kendall tau ranked correlation."
6227,2,"Overall, the HIQUAL for newspaper articles comprised 10 items across 5 domains: reliability, usefulness, understandability, sufficiency, and transparency. "
6228,2,"The interrater agreement for the article on colorectal cancer was in the moderate to substantial range (Fleiss kappa =0.48, SE 0.11; Gwet agreement coefficient=0.74, SE 0.13), while for the article introducing obesity genetic testing it was in the substantial range, with values of 0.63 (SE 0.28) and 0.86 (SE 0.10) for the two measures, respectively. "
6229,2,"There was relatively low agreement for the article on hypertension diagnostic criteria at 0.20 (SE 0.10) and 0.75 (SE 0.13), respectively. "
6230,2,"Validity of the correlation assessed with the Kendall tau showed good correlation between tools (HIQUAL vs DISCERN=0.72, HIQUAL vs QUEST [Quality Evaluation Scoring Tool]=0.69)."
6231,3,"We developed a new assessment tool to evaluate the quality of health information in online newspaper articles, to help consumers discern accurate sources of health information. "
6232,3,The HIQUAL can help increase the accuracy and quality of online health information in Korea.
6233,4,"Racial and Ethnic Differences in COVID-19 Outcomes, Stressors, Fear, and Prevention Behaviors Among US Women: Web-Based Cross-sectional Study"
6234,0,"In the United States, racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with persistent social and structural factors contributing to these disparities. "
6235,0,"At the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender, women of color may be disadvantaged in terms of COVID-19 outcomes due to their role as essential workers, their higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, their increased stress and anxiety from the loss of wages and caregiving, and domestic violence."
6236,1,"Between May and June 2020, women were recruited into the Capturing Women's Experiences in Outbreak and Pandemic Environments (COPE) Study, a web-based cross-sectional study, using advertisements on Facebook; 491 eligible women completed a self-administered internet-based cross-sectional survey. "
6237,1,"Descriptive statistics were used to examine racial and ethnic differences (White; Asian; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; Black; Hispanic, Latina, or Spanish Origin; American Indian or Alaskan Native; multiracial or some other race, ethnicity, or origin) on COVID-19 outcomes, stressors, fear, and prevention behaviors."
6238,2,"Among our sample of women, 16% (73/470) reported COVID-19 symptoms, 22% (18/82) were concerned about possible exposure from the people they knew who tested positive for COVID-19, and 51.4% (227/442) knew where to get tested; yet, only 5.8% (27/469) had been tested. "
6239,2,"Racial/ethnic differences were observed, with racial/ethnic minority women being less likely to know where to get tested. "
6240,2,"Significant differences in race/ethnicity were observed for select stressors (food insecurity, not enough money, homeschooling children, unable to have a doctor or telemedicine appointment) and prevention behaviors (handwashing with soap, self-isolation if sick, public glove use, not leaving home for any activities). "
6241,2,"Although no racial/ethnic differences emerged from the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, significant racial/ethnic differences were observed for some of the individual scale items (eg, being afraid of getting COVID-19, sleep loss, and heart racing due to worrying about COVID-19)."
6242,3,"The low prevalence of COVID-19 testing and knowledge of where to get tested indicate a critical need to expand testing for women in the United States, particularly among racial/ethnic minority women. "
6243,3,"Although the overall prevalence of engagement in prevention behaviors was high, targeted education and promotion of prevention activities are warranted in communities of color, particularly with consideration for stressors and adverse mental health."
6244,4,Needs and Preferences of Middle-Aged and Older Adults in Taiwan for Companion Robots and Pets: Survey Study
6245,0,"In recent years, robots have been considered a new tech industry that can be used to solve the shortage in human resources in the field of health care. "
6246,0,"Also, animal-assisted therapy has been used to provide assistance, companionship, and interaction among the elderly and has been shown to have a positive impact on their emotional and psychological well-being. "
6247,0,Both pets and robots can provide dynamic communication and positive interaction patterns. 
6248,0,"However, preferences for middle-aged and older adults in this regard are not clear."
6249,1,A total of 273 middle-aged >= 45 and older adults aged years and living in the community were invited to answer a structured questionnaire after watching a companion robot video. 
6250,1,"Sociodemographic data, physical health status and activities, experience with technology, eHealth literacy, and acceptance and attitude toward robots and pets were recorded and analyzed using multinomial logistic regression analysis."
6251,2,"Age, level of education, type of dwelling, occupation, retirement status, number of comorbidities, experience with pets, experience using apps, and eHealth literacy were significantly associated with acceptance of robots and pets. "
6252,2,"Middle-aged and older women preferred robots with an animal-like appearance, while men preferred robots that resembled a human adult. "
6253,2,"In terms of robot functions, participants preferred a companion robot with dancing, singing, storytelling, or news-reporting functions. "
6254,2,Participants' marital status and whether or not they lived alone affected their preference of functions in the companion robot.
6255,3,Findings from this study inform the development of social robots with regard to their appearance and functions to address loneliness in later life in fast-aging societies.

6257,0,Engagement is positively associated with the effectiveness of digital health interventions. 
6258,0,"It is unclear whether tracking devices that automatically synchronize data (eg, Fitbit) produce different engagement levels compared with manually entering data."
6259,1,"A subsample of users (n=22,142) of the free 10,000 Steps physical activity program were classified into one of the following user groups based on the step-logging method: Website Only (14,617/22,142, 66.01%), App Only (2100/22,142, 9.48%), Fitbit Only (1705/22,142, 7.7%), Web and App (2057/22,142, 9.29%), and Fitbit Combination (combination of web, app, and Fitbit; 1663/22,142, 7.51%). "
6260,1,Generalized linear regression and binary logistic regression were used to examine differences between user groups' engagement and participation parameters. 
6261,1,The time to nonusage attrition was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression.
6262,2,App Only users were significantly younger and Fitbit user groups had higher proportions of women compared with other groups. 
6263,2,The following outcomes were significant and relative to the Website Only group. 
6264,2,"The App Only group had fewer website sessions (odds ratio [OR] -6.9, 95% CI -7.6 to -6.2), whereas the Fitbit Only (OR 10.6, 95% CI 8.8-12.3), Web and App (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.4-2.6), and Fitbit Combination (OR 8.0; 95% CI 6.2-9.7) groups had more sessions. "
6265,2,"The App Only (OR - 0.7, 95% CI -0.9 to -0.4) and Fitbit Only (OR -0.5, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.2) groups spent fewer minutes on the website per session, whereas the Fitbit Combination group (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0-0.5) spent more minutes. "
6266,2,"All groups, except the Fitbit Combination group, viewed fewer website pages per session. "
6267,2,"The mean daily step count was lower for the App Only (OR -201.9, 95% CI - 387.7 to -116.0) and Fitbit Only (OR -492.9, 95% CI -679.9 to -305.8) groups but higher for the Web and App group (OR 258.0, 95% CI 76.9-439.2). "
6268,2,"The Fitbit Only (OR 5.0, 95% CI 3.4-6.6), Web and App (OR 7.2, 95% CI 5.9-8.6), and Fitbit Combination (OR 15.6, 95% CI 13.7-17.5) groups logged a greater number of step entries. "
6269,2,"The App Only group was less likely (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.94) and other groups were more likely to participate in Challenges. "
6270,2,The mean time to nonusage attrition was 35 (SD 26) days and was lower than average in the Website Only and App Only groups and higher than average in the Web and App and Fitbit Combination groups.

6278,2,"The dominant themes in the Republican legislators' discourse included vaccine development (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.47-1.55; P<.001) and hospital resources and equipment (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18-1.25). "
6279,2,"Nonhealth care-related topics associated with a Democratic affiliation included protections for essential workers (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.52-1.59), the 2020 election and voting (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.27-1.35), unemployment and housing (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.24-1.31), crime and racism (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18-1.26), public town halls (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16-1.23), the Trump Administration (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.19-1.26), immigration (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.12-1.19), and the loss of life (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.35-1.42). "
6280,2,"The themes associated with the Republican affiliation included China (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.85-1.92), small business assistance (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.23-1.3), congressional relief bills (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.2-1.27), press briefings (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.19-1.26), and economic recovery (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16-1.23)."
6281,3,Divergent language use on social media corresponds to the partisan divide in the first several months of the course of the COVID-19 public health crisis.
6282,4,Patient Monitoring Alarms in an Intensive Care Unit: Observational Study With Do-It-Yourself Instructions
6283,0,"As one of the most essential technical components of the intensive care unit (ICU), continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters has significantly improved patient safety by alerting staff through an alarm when a parameter deviates from the normal range. "
6284,0,"However, the vast number of alarms regularly overwhelms staff and may induce alarm fatigue, a condition recently exacerbated by COVID-19 and potentially endangering patients."
6285,1,This observational study was conducted using alarm log data extracted from the patient monitoring system of a 21-bed surgical ICU in 2019. 
6286,1,DIY instructions were iteratively developed in informal interdisciplinary team meetings. 
6287,1,"The data analysis was grounded in a framework consisting of 5 dimensions, each with specific metrics: alarm load (eg, alarms per bed per day, alarm flood conditions, alarm per device and per criticality), avoidable alarms, (eg, the number of technical alarms), responsiveness and alarm handling (eg alarm duration), sensing (eg, usage of the alarm pause function), and exposure (eg, alarms per room type).Results were visualized using the R package ggplot2 to provide detailed insights into the ICU's alarm situation."
6288,2,We developed 6 DIY instructions that should be followed iteratively step by step. 
6289,2,Alarm load metrics should be (re)defined before alarm log data are collected and analyzed. 
6290,2,Intuitive visualizations of the alarm metrics should be created next and presented to staff in order to help identify patterns in the alarm data for designing and implementing effective alarm management interventions. 
6291,2,We provide the script we used for the data preparation and an R-Markdown file to create comprehensive alarm reports. 
6292,2,"The alarm load in the respective ICU was quantified by 152.5 (SD 42.2) alarms per bed per day on average and alarm flood conditions with, on average, 69.55 (SD 31.12) per day that both occurred mostly in the morning shifts. "
6293,2,"Most alarms were issued by the ventilator, invasive blood pressure device, and electrocardiogram (ie, high and low blood pressure, high respiratory rate, low heart rate). "
6294,2,"The exposure to alarms per bed per day was higher in single rooms (26%, mean 172.9/137.2 alarms per day per bed)."
6295,3,Analyzing ICU alarm log data provides valuable insights into the current alarm situation. 
6296,3,Our results call for alarm management interventions that effectively reduce the number of alarms in order to ensure patient safety and ICU staff's work satisfaction. 
6297,3,We hope our DIY instructions encourage others to follow suit in analyzing and publishing their ICU alarm data.
6298,4,A COVID-19 Pandemic Artificial Intelligence-Based System With Deep Learning Forecasting and Automatic Statistical Data Acquisition: Development and Implementation Study
6299,0,"More than 79.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 17 million deaths were caused by SARS-CoV-2; the disease was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization Control of the COVID-19 epidemic has become a crucial issue around the globe, but there are limited studies that investigate the global trend of the COVID-19 pandemic together with each country's policy measures."
6300,1,"The COVID-19 Pandemic AI System (CPAIS) integrated two data sets: the data set from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from the Blavatnik School of Government, which is maintained by the University of Oxford, and the data set from the COVID-19 Data Repository, which was established by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. "
6301,1,"This study utilized four statistical and deep learning techniques for forecasting: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural network (FNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM). "
6302,1,"With regard to 1-year records (ie, whole time series data), records from the last 14 days served as the validation set to evaluate the performance of the forecast, whereas earlier records served as the training set."
6303,2,A total of 171 countries that featured in both databases were included in the online system. 
6304,2,"The CPAIS was developed to explore variations, trends, and forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic across several counties. "
6305,2,"For instance, the number of confirmed monthly cases in the United States reached a local peak in July 2020 and another peak of 6,368,591 in December 2020. "
6306,2,A dynamic heat map with policy measures depicts changes in COVID-19 measures for each country. 
6307,2,"A total of 19 measures were embedded within the three sections presented on the website, and only 4 of the 19 measures were continuous measures related to financial support or investment. "
6308,2,"Deep learning models were used to enable COVID-19 forecasting; the performances of ARIMA, FNN, and the MLP neural network were not stable because their forecast accuracy was only better than LSTM for a few countries. "
6309,2,"LSTM demonstrated the best forecast accuracy for Canada, as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 2272.551, 1501.248, and 0.2723075, respectively. "
6310,2,ARIMA (RMSE=317.53169; MAPE=0.4641688) and FNN (RMSE=181.29894; MAPE=0.2708482) demonstrated better performance for South Korea.
6311,3,The CPAIS collects and summarizes information about the COVID-19 pandemic and offers data visualization and deep learning-based prediction. 
6312,3,It might be a useful reference for predicting a serious outbreak or epidemic. 
6313,3,"Moreover, the system undergoes daily updates and includes the latest information on vaccination, which may change the dynamics of the pandemic."
6314,4,Tweet Topics and Sentiments Relating to COVID-19 Vaccination Among Australian Twitter Users: Machine Learning Analysis
6315,0,"COVID-19 is one of the greatest threats to human beings in terms of health care, economy, and society in recent history. "
6316,0,"Up to this moment, there have been no signs of remission, and there is no proven effective cure. "
6317,0,Vaccination is the primary biomedical preventive measure against the novel coronavirus. 
6318,0,"However, public bias or sentiments, as reflected on social media, may have a significant impact on the progression toward achieving herd immunity."
6319,1,"We collected 31,100 English tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords between January and October 2020 from Australian Twitter users. "
6320,1,"Specifically, we analyzed tweets by visualizing high-frequency word clouds and correlations between word tokens. "
6321,1,We built a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. 
6322,1,We also performed sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiments and emotions related to COVID-19 vaccination in Australia.
6323,2,"Our analysis identified 3 LDA topics: (1) attitudes toward COVID-19 and its vaccination, (2) advocating infection control measures against COVID-19, and (3) misconceptions and complaints about COVID-19 control. "
6324,2,Nearly two-thirds of the sentiments of all tweets expressed a positive public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine; around one-third were negative. 
6325,2,"Among the 8 basic emotions, trust and anticipation were the two prominent positive emotions observed in the tweets, while fear was the top negative emotion."
6326,3,Our findings indicate that some Twitter users in Australia supported infection control measures against COVID-19 and refuted misinformation. 
6327,3,"However, those who underestimated the risks and severity of COVID-19 may have rationalized their position on COVID-19 vaccination with conspiracy theories. "
6328,3,We also noticed that the level of positive sentiment among the public may not be sufficient to increase vaccination coverage to a level high enough to achieve vaccination-induced herd immunity. 
6329,3,"Governments should explore public opinion and sentiments toward COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, and implement an effective vaccination promotion scheme in addition to supporting the development and clinical administration of COVID-19 vaccines."
6330,4,mHealth Interventions for Self-Harm: Scoping Review
6331,0,"Self-harm is a growing issue with increasing prevalence rates; however, individuals who self-harm do not often receive treatment. "
6332,0,"Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are a possible solution to some of the barriers that individuals face when seeking support, and they have also been found to be effective in improving mental health. "
6333,0,"Thus far, reviews of mHealth interventions for self-harm have been limited by study type. "
6334,0,"Therefore, we determined that a broader scoping review will provide a more exhaustive understanding of mHealth interventions for self-harm."
6335,1,"A search was conducted using Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. "
6336,1,"Studies were included if they described an mHealth intervention designed to have a direct (ie, if the intervention was designed for self-harm or for people who self-harm) or indirect (ie, if self-harm was measured as an outcome) treatment effect and if the paper was available in English. "
6337,1,There were no exclusion criteria based on the study design.
6338,2,"A total of 36 papers were included in the review, and most of them were randomized controlled trials published within the last 4 years. "
6339,2,"The interventions were mostly smartphone apps and calling or texting services, with 62% (21/34) having underlying therapeutic models to inform the intervention content. "
6340,2,"They were generally shown to be promising and appealing, but only 5 were widely available for use. "
6341,2,"Outcomes focused on a reduction of self-harm and suicidality, mood, and the users' experiences of the intervention. "
6342,2,"Samples were typically nondiverse, and there was limited variety in the study designs and in the measurements of self-harm recovery."
6343,3,Promising and appealing mHealth interventions have been developed but are not widely available. 
6344,3,Research could benefit from greater diversity as well as a broader and more nuanced understanding of recovery from self-harm.
6345,4,Determinants of Knowledge About Dietary Supplements Among Polish Internet Users: Nationwide Cross-sectional Study
6346,0,An accurate understanding of dietary supplements (DS) is a prerequisite for informed decisions regarding their intake. 
6347,0,"However, there is a need for studies on this understanding among the public based on validated research tools."
6348,1,The study protocol was prospectively registered with a statistical analysis plan. 
6349,1,"Polish users of a web-based health service and a social networking service were administered a survey consisting of the recently developed questionnaire on knowledge about DS, the questionnaire on trust in advertising DS, the beliefs about medicines questionnaire, and several other health-related single-item measures and sociodemographic questions. "
6350,1,The results were subjected to general linear modeling.
6351,2,A total of 6273 participants were included. 
6352,2,"Of the 17 yes or no questions in the questionnaire of knowledge about DS, the mean number of correct responses was 9.0 (95% CI 8.9-9.1). "
6353,2,Health service users performed worse than social networking users by 2.3 points (95% CI 2.1-2.5) in an analysis adjusted for potential confounders. 
6354,2,"Internet users had fewer true beliefs about DS if they presented higher trust in their advertising (adjusted beta=-.37; 95% CI -.39 to -.34), used DS (adjusted beta=-.14; 95% CI -.17 to -.12), experienced their positive effect (adjusted beta=-.16; 95% CI -.18 to -.13), were older or younger than 35 years (adjusted beta=-.14; 95% CI -.17 to -.12), expressed interest in the topic of DS (adjusted beta=-.10; 95% CI -.13 to -.08), reported getting information about the products from friends (adjusted beta=-.13; 95% CI -.15 to -.11), and believed that medicines are harmful (adjusted beta=-.12; 95% CI -.15 to -.10). "
6355,2,The proposed 5-predictor model could explain 31.2% of the variance in knowledge about DS. 
6356,2,The model appeared resistant to overfitting and was able to forecast most of the observed associations.
6357,3,Polish internet users with no medical education exhibit some false beliefs regarding DS. 
6358,3,Trusting the advertising of DS appears to conflict with knowledge about them. 
6359,3,There is an urgent need for effective web-based educational campaigns on DS and the promotion of advertising literacy. 
6360,3,"After the proposed predictive model is externally validated, it may help identify the least informed target audience."
6361,4,"Association of Perceived Threat, Negative Emotions, and Self-Efficacy With Mental Health and Personal Protective Behavior Among Chinese Pregnant Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study"
6362,0,COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease that has created health care challenges worldwide. 
6363,0,Pregnant women are particularly affected by this disease.
6364,1,"A total of 4087 pregnant women from China completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between March 3 and 10, 2020."
6365,2,"The prevalence of probable depression and anxiety was 48.7% (1989/4087) and 33.0% (1347/4087), respectively; 23.8% participants (974/4087) reported always wearing a face mask when going out. "
6366,2,"Of the 4087 participants, 32.1% (1313) and 36.4% (1490) perceived themselves or their family members to be susceptible to COVID-19 infection, respectively; 3216-3518 (78.7%-86.1%) agreed the disease would have various severe consequences. "
6367,2,"Additionally, 2275 of the 4087 participants (55.7%) showed self-efficacy in protecting themselves from contracting COVID-19, and 2232 (54.6%) showed efficacy in protecting their family members; 1303 (31.9%) reported a high level of fear of the disease, and 2780-3056 (68.0%-74.8%) expressed worry about various aspects of COVID-19. "
6368,2,"The results of the multivariate multinominal logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived impact, fear, and worry were risk factors for probable depression and anxiety, while self-efficacy was a protective factor. "
6369,2,The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that perceived susceptibility was associated with always wearing a face mask.
6370,3,Chinese pregnant women showed high levels of mental distress but low levels of personal protective behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
6371,3,Interventions are needed to promote the mental health and health behavior of pregnant women during the pandemic.
6372,4,Key Variables for Effective eHealth Designs for Individuals With and Without Mental Health Disorders: 2ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¹ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â?2-4 Fractional Factorial Experiment
6373,0,"eHealth applications not only offer the potential to increase service convenience and responsiveness but also expand the ability to tailor services to improve relevance, engagement, and use. "
6374,0,"To achieve these goals, it is critical that the designs are intuitive. "
6375,0,"Limited research exists on designs that work for those with a severe mental illness (SMI), many of whom have difficulty traveling for treatments, reject or infrequently seek treatment, and tend to discontinue treatments for significant periods."
6376,1,A 2(12-4) fractional factorial experiment was used to specify the designs of 256 eHealth websites. 
6377,1,This approach systematically varied the 12 design variables. 
6378,1,"The final destination contents of all websites were identical, and only the designs of the navigational pages varied. "
6379,1,The 12 design elements were manipulated systematically to allow the assessment of combinations of design elements rather than only one element at a time. 
6380,1,"Of the 256 websites, participants (n=222) sought the same information on 8 randomly selected websites. "
6381,1,"Mixed effect regressions, which accounted for the dependency of the 8 observations within participants, were used to test for main effects and interactions on the ability and time to find information. "
6382,1,"Classification and regression tree analyses were used to identify effects among the 12 variables on participants' abilities to locate information, for the sample overall and each of the 3 diagnostic groups of participants (schizophrenia spectrum disorder [SSD], other mental illnesses, and no mental illness)."
6383,2,The best and worst designs were identified for each of these 4 groups. 
6384,2,"The depth of a website's navigation, that is, the number of screens users needed to navigate to find the desired content, had the greatest influence on usability (ability to find information) and efficiency (time to find information). "
6385,2,"The worst performing designs for those with SSD had a 9% success rate, and the best had a 51% success rate: the navigational designs made a 42% difference in usability. "
6386,2,"For the group with other mental illnesses, the design made a 50% difference, and for those with no mental illness, a 55% difference was observed. "
6387,2,"The designs with the highest usability had several key design similarities, as did those with the poorest usability."
6388,3,It is possible to identify evidence-based strategies for designing eHealth applications that result in significantly better performance. 
6389,3,These improvements in design benefit all users. 
6390,3,"For those with SSD or other SMIs, there are designs that are highly effective. "
6391,3,Both the best and worst designs have key similarities but vary in some characteristics.
6392,4,Behavioral Intention to Receive a COVID-19 Vaccination Among Chinese Factory Workers: Cross-sectional Online Survey
6393,0,COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China soon. 
6394,0,Understanding communities' responses to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines is important. 
6395,0,We applied the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework.
6396,1,Participants were full-time employees 18 years or older who worked in factories in Shenzhen. 
6397,1,"Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive a physical examination annually Eligible workers attending six physical examination sites were invited to complete a survey on September 1-7, 2020. "
6398,1,"Out of 2653 eligible factory workers, 2053 (77.4%) completed the online survey. "
6399,1,Multivariate two-level logistic regression models and ordinal logistic regression models were fitted.
6400,2,"The prevalence of behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was 66.6% (n=1368, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate) and 80.6% (n=1655, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and free vaccines). "
6401,2,"After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.25 and AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), perceived support from significant others for getting a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32-1.55 and AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25-1.50), and perceived behavioral control to get a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.32-1.73 and AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51) were positively associated with both dependent variables (conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate or free vaccines, respectively). "
6402,2,"Regarding social media influence, higher frequency of exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination at market rate (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.70) or a free vaccination (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.71). "
6403,2,"Higher self-reported compliance with wearing a face mask in the workplace (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.58 and AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.27) and other public spaces (AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.42-2.29 and AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.77), hand hygiene (AOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.47 and AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.19-1.93), and avoiding social gatherings (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47 and AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.95) and crowded places (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51 and AOR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37-2.18) were also positively associated with both dependent variables. "
6404,2,"The number of COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by the factory was positively associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination under both scenarios (AOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12 and AOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11)."
6405,3,Factory workers in China reported a high behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. 
6406,3,The theory of planned behavior is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination.
6407,4,A Novel Mobile App (Heali) for Disease Treatment in Participants With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial
6408,0,"A diet high in fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) has been shown to exacerbate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). "
6409,0,Previous literature reports significant improvement in IBS symptoms with initiation of a low FODMAP diet (LFD) and monitored reintroduction. 
6410,0,"However, dietary adherence to the LFD is difficult, with patients stating that the information given by health care providers is often generalized and nonspecific, requiring them to search for supplementary information to fit their needs."
6411,1,"Participants were randomized into 2 groups: the control group (CON), in which participants received educational materials, and the experimental group (APP), in which participants received access to the mobile app and educational materials. "
6412,1,"Over the course of this unblinded online trial, all participants completed a battery of 5 questionnaires at baseline and at the end of the trial to document IBS symptoms, quality of life, LFD knowledge, and LFD adherence."
6413,2,"We enrolled 58 participants in the study (29 in each group), and 25 participants completed the study in its entirety (11 and 14 for the CON and APP groups, respectively). "
6414,2,"Final, per-protocol analyses showed greater improvement in quality of life score for the APP group compared to the CON group (31.1 and 11.8, respectively; P=.04). "
6415,2,Reduction in total IBS symptom severity score was 24% greater for the APP group versus the CON group. 
6416,2,"Although this did not achieve significance (-170 vs -138 respectively; P=.37), the reduction in the subscore for bowel habit dissatisfaction was 2-fold greater for the APP group than for the CON group (P=.05)."
6417,3,"This initial study provides preliminary evidence that Heali may provide therapeutic benefit to its users, specifically improvements in quality of life and bowel habits. "
6418,3,"Although this study was underpowered, findings from this study warrant further research in a larger sample of participants to test the efficacy of Heali app use to improve outcomes for patients with IBS."
6419,4,Noncommunicable Disease Risk Factors and Mobile Phones: A Proposed Research Agenda
6420,0,Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are associated with the burden of premature deaths and huge medical costs globally. 
6421,0,"There is an increasing number of studies combining a multiple health behavior change (MHBC) intervention paradigm with eHealth approaches to jointly promote weight-related health behaviors among people with NCD; yet, a comprehensive summary of these studies is lacking."
6422,1,"Following PRISMA guidelines, 4 electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus) were systematically searched to identify eligible articles based on a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria. "
6423,1,"Article selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed by 2 authors. "
6424,1,"The standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for 3 intervention outcomes (physical activity, healthy diet, and weight), and subsequent subgroup analyses were performed for gender, age, intervention duration, channel, and theory. "
6425,1,"Calculations were conducted, and figures were produced in SPSS 22 and Review Manager 5.3."
6426,2,"Of the 664 original hits generated by the systematic searches, 15 eligible studies with moderate to high quality were included. "
6427,2,No potential publication bias was detected using statistical analyses. 
6428,2,"Studies varied in intervention channel, intensity, and content. "
6429,2,"The meta-analysis revealed that the eHealth MHBC interventions significantly promoted physical activity (SMD 0.85, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.47, P=.008) and healthy diet (SMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.43, P=.02), but did not contribute to a healthy weight status (SMD -0.13, 95% CI= -0.47 to 0.20, P=.43) among people with NCDs, compared to the control conditions. "
6430,2,"Results from subgroup analysis indicated that theory based interventions achieved greater effect than nontheory-based interventions in promoting physical activity, and interventions with traditional approaches (SMS, telephone) were more effective than those with modern internet-based approaches in promoting healthy diet."
6431,3,The results of this review indicates that eHealth MHBC interventions achieve preliminary success in promoting physical activity and healthy diet behaviors among people with NCD. 
6432,3,Future studies could improve the intervention design to achieve better intervention effectiveness.
6433,4,Peer-to-Peer Sharing of Social Media Messages on Sexual Health in a School-Based Intervention: Opportunities and Challenges Identified in the STASH Feasibility Trial
6434,0,There is a strong interest in the use of social media to spread positive sexual health messages through social networks of young people. 
6435,0,"However, research suggests that this potential may be limited by a reluctance to be visibly associated with sexual health content on the web or social media and by the lack of trust in the veracity of peer sources."
6436,1,"Following training, and as a part of their role, student-nominated peer supporters (aged 14-16 years) invited school friends to trainer-monitored, private Facebook groups. "
6437,1,Peer supporters posted curated educational sex and relationship content within these groups. 
6438,1,Data came from a feasibility study of the STASH intervention in 6 UK schools. 
6439,1,"To understand student experiences of the social media component, we used data from 11 semistructured paired and group interviews with peer supporters and their friends (collectively termed students; n=42, aged 14-16 years), a web-based postintervention questionnaire administered to peer supporters (n=88), and baseline and follow-up questionnaires administered to students in the intervention year group (n=680 and n=603, respectively). "
6440,1,We carried out a thematic analysis of qualitative data and a descriptive analysis of quantitative data.
6441,2,Message sharing by peer supporters was hindered by variable engagement with Facebook. 
6442,2,The trainer-monitored and private Facebook groups were acceptable to student members (peer supporters and their friends) and reassuring to peer supporters but led to engagement that ran parallel to-rather than embedded in-their routine social media use. 
6443,2,"The offline context of a school-based intervention helped legitimate and augment Facebook posts; however, even where friends were receptive to STASH messages, they did not necessarily engage visibly on social media. "
6444,2,"Preferences for content design varied; however, humor, color, and text brevity were important. "
6445,2,Preferences for social media versus offline message sharing varied.
6446,3,Invitation-only social media groups formed around peer supporters' existing friendship networks hold potential for diffusing messages in peer-based sexual health interventions. 
6447,3,"Ideally, interactive opportunities should not be limited to single social media platforms and should run alongside offline conversations. "
6448,3,There are tensions between offering young people autonomy to engage flexibly and authentically and the need for adult oversight of activities for information accuracy and safeguarding.
6449,4,Online Mental Health Animations for Young People: Qualitative Empirical Thematic Analysis and Knowledge Transfer
6450,0,Mental ill-health is one of the most significant health and social issues affecting young people globally. 
6451,0,"To address the mental health crisis, a number of cross-sectoral research and action priorities have been identified. "
6452,0,"These include improving mental health literacy, translating research findings into accessible public health outputs, and the use of digital technologies. "
6453,0,"There are, however, few examples of public health-oriented knowledge transfer activities involving collaborations between researchers, the Arts, and online platforms in the field of youth mental health."
6454,1,"Qualitative data were collected from a sample of 17 youth in Ireland, aged 18-21 years, as part of the longitudinal population-based Adolescent Brain Development study. "
6455,1,Interviews explored the life histories and the emotional and mental health of participants. 
6456,1,The narrative analysis revealed 5 thematic findings relating to young people's emotional and mental health. 
6457,1,"Through a collaboration between research, the Arts, and the online sector, the empirical thematic findings were translated into 5 public health animations. "
6458,1,The animations were hosted and promoted on 3 social media platforms of the Irish youth health website called SpunOut. 
6459,1,"Viewing data, collected over a 12-month period, were analyzed to determine the reach of the animations."
6460,2,"Narrative thematic analysis identified anxiety, depression, feeling different, loneliness, and being bullied as common experiences for young people. "
6461,2,These thematic findings formed the basis of the animations. 
6462,2,"During the 12 months following the launch of the animations, they were viewed 15,848 times. "
6463,2,A majority of views occurred during the period of the social media ad campaign at a cost of (sic)0.035 (approximately US $0.042) per view. 
6464,2,Animations on feeling different and being bullied accounted for the majority of views.
6465,3,This project demonstrates that online animations provide an accessible means of translating empirical research findings into meaningful public health outputs. 
6466,3,"They offer a cost-effective way to provide targeted online information about mental health, coping, and help-seeking to young people. "
6467,3,Cross-sectoral collaboration is required to leverage the knowledge and expertise required to maximize the quality and potential reach of any knowledge transfer activities. 
6468,3,A high level of engagement is possible by targeting non-help-seeking young people on their native social media platforms. 
6469,3,"Paid promotion is, therefore, an important consideration when budgeting for online knowledge translation and dissemination activities in health research."
6470,4,Medical Tourism and Telemedicine: A New Frontier of an Old Business
6471,0,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a national public health protection agency in the United States. 
6472,0,"With the escalating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society in the United States and around the world, the CDC has become one of the focal points of public discussion."
6473,1,"Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to August 14, 2020. "
6474,1,"We used R (The R Foundation) to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained any of five specific keywords-cdc, CDC, centers for disease control and prevention, CDCgov, and cdcgov-while eliminating all 91 tweets posted by the CDC itself. "
6475,1,"The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 290,764 unique tweets from 152,314 different users. "
6476,1,We used R to perform the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm for topic modeling.
6477,2,The Twitter data generated 16 topics that the public linked to the CDC when they talked about COVID-19. 
6478,2,"Among the topics, the most discussed was COVID-19 death counts, accounting for 12.16% (n=35,347) of the total 290,764 tweets in the analysis, followed by general opinions about the credibility of the CDC and other authorities and the CDC's COVID-19 guidelines, with over 20,000 tweets for each. "
6479,2,"The 16 topics fell into four overarching themes: knowing the virus and the situation, policy and government actions, response guidelines, and general opinion about credibility."
6480,3,"Social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide valuable databases for public opinion. "
6481,3,"In a protracted pandemic, such as COVID-19, quickly and efficiently identifying the topics within the public discussion on Twitter would help public health agencies improve the next-round communication with the public."
6482,4,Dynamic Panel Data Modeling and Surveillance of COVID-19 in Metropolitan Areas in the United States: Longitudinal Trend Analysis
6483,0,The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and differential impacts on metropolitan areas across the United States and around the world. 
6484,0,"Within the United States, metropolitan areas that were hit earliest with the pandemic and reacted with scientifically based health policy were able to contain the virus by late spring. "
6485,0,"For other areas that kept businesses open, the first wave in the United States hit in mid-summer. "
6486,0,"As the weather turns colder, universities resume classes, and people tire of lockdowns, a second wave is ascending in both metropolitan and rural areas. "
6487,0,"It becomes more obvious that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed at the local level to track recent shifts in the pandemic, rates of increase, and persistence."
6488,1,"Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 260 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. "
6489,1,We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the 25 largest US metropolitan areas as a function of the prior number of cases and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel data model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R.
6490,2,"Minneapolis and Chicago have the greatest average number of daily new positive results per standardized 100,000 population (which we refer to as speed). "
6491,2,Extreme behavior in Minneapolis showed an increase in speed from 17 to 30 (67%) in 1 week. 
6492,2,The jerk and acceleration calculated for these areas also showed extreme behavior. 
6493,2,"The dynamic panel data model shows that Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit have the largest persistence effects, meaning that new cases pertaining to a specific week are statistically attributable to new cases from the prior week."
6494,3,Three of the metropolitan areas with historically early and harsh winters have the highest persistence effects out of the top 25 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States at the beginning of their cold weather season. 
6495,3,"With these persistence effects, and with indoor activities becoming more popular as the weather gets colder, stringent COVID-19 regulations will be more important than ever to flatten the second wave of the pandemic. "
6496,3,"As colder weather grips more of the nation, southern metropolitan areas may also see large spikes in the number of cases."
6497,4,Measuring Stress in Health Professionals Over the Phone Using Automatic Speech Analysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Pilot Study
6498,0,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, new digital solutions have been developed for infection control. "
6499,0,"In particular, contact tracing mobile apps provide a means for governments to manage both health and economic concerns. "
6500,0,"However, public reception of these apps is paramount to their success, and global uptake rates have been low."
6501,1,A cohort of 505 adults from the general community completed an online survey. 
6502,1,"As the primary outcome measure, participants were asked to indicate whether they had downloaded the contact tracing app TraceTogether introduced at the national level. "
6503,1,"The following were assessed as predictor variables: (1) participant demographics, (2) behavioral modifications on account of the pandemic, and (3) pandemic severity (the number of cases and lockdown status)."
6504,2,"Within our data set, the strongest predictor of the uptake of TraceTogether was the extent to which individuals had already adjusted their lifestyles because of the pandemic (z=13.56; P<.001). "
6505,2,"Network analyses revealed that uptake was most related to the following: using hand sanitizers, avoiding public transport, and preferring outdoor over indoor venues during the pandemic. "
6506,2,"However, demographic and situational characteristics were not significantly associated with app downloads."
6507,3,Efforts to introduce contact tracing apps could capitalize on pandemic-related behavioral adjustments among individuals. 
6508,3,"Given that a large number of individuals is required to download contact tracing apps for contact tracing to be effective, further studies are required to understand how citizens respond to contact tracing apps."
6509,4,Unfolding the Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance in China
6510,0,"China is at the forefront of global efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccines and has five fast-tracked candidates at the final-stage, large-scale human clinical trials testing phase. "
6511,0,Vaccine-promoting policymaking for public engagement is a prerequisite for social mobilization. 
6512,0,"However, making an informed and judicious choice is a dilemma for the Chinese government in the vaccine promotion context."
6513,1,"We proposed a novel behavioral dynamics model, SRS/I (susceptible-reading-susceptible/immune), to analyze opinion transmission paradigms on Chinese social media. "
6514,1,"Coupled with a meta-analysis and natural language processing techniques, the emotion polarity of individual opinions was examined in their given context."
6515,2,We collected more than 1.75 million Weibo messages about COVID-19 vaccines from January to October 2020. 
6516,2,"According to the public opinion reproduction ratio (R-0), the dynamic propagation of those messages can be classified into three periods: the ferment period (R-01=1.1360), the revolution period (R-02=2.8278), and the transmission period (R-03=3.0729). "
6517,2,Topics on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in China include price and side effects. 
6518,2,"From September to October, Weibo users claimed that the vaccine was overpriced, making up 18.3% (n=899) of messages; 38.1% (n=81,909) of relevant topics on Weibo received likes. "
6519,2,"On the contrary, the number of messages that considered the vaccine to be reasonably priced was twice as high but received fewer likes, accounting for 25.0% (n=53,693). "
6520,2,"In addition, we obtained 441 (47.7%) positive and 295 (31.9%) negative Weibo messages about side effects. "
6521,2,"Interestingly, inactivated vaccines instigated more heated discussions than any other vaccine type. "
6522,2,"The discussions, forwards, comments, and likes associated with topics related to inactivated vaccines accounted for 53% (n=588), 42% (n=3072), 56% (n=3671), and 49% (n=17,940), respectively, of the total activity associated with the five types of vaccines in China."
6523,3,"Most Chinese netizens believe that the vaccine is less expensive than previously thought, while some claim they cannot afford it for their entire family. "
6524,3,The findings demonstrate that Chinese individuals are inclined to be positive about side effects over time and are proud of China's involvement with vaccine development. 
6525,3,"Nevertheless, they have a collective misunderstanding about inactivated vaccines, insisting that inactivated vaccines are safer than other vaccines. "
6526,3,"Reflecting on netizens' collective responses, the unfolding determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance provide illuminating benchmarks for vaccine-promoting policies."
6527,4,The Role of Health Technologies in Multicomponent Primary Care Interventions: Systematic Review
6528,0,"Several countries around the world have implemented multicomponent interventions to enhance primary care, as a way of strengthening their health systems to cope with an aging chronically ill population and rising costs. "
6529,0,"Some of these efforts have included technology-based enhancements as one of the features to support the overall intervention, but their details and impacts have not been explored."
6530,1,A systematic review was performed following Cochrane guidelines. 
6531,1,"An electronic search, conducted on May 30, 2019, was supplemented with manual and grey literature searches in December 2019, to identify multicomponent interventions that included at least one technology-based enhancement. "
6532,1,"After title/abstract and full text screening, selected articles were assessed for quality based on their study design. "
6533,1,A descriptive narrative synthesis was used for analysis and presentation of the results.
6534,2,"Of 37 articles, 14 (38%) described the inclusion of a technology-based innovation as part of their multicomponent interventions to enhance primary care. "
6535,2,"The most commonly identified technologies were the use of electronic health records, data monitoring technologies, and online portals with messaging platforms. "
6536,2,"The most common aim of these technologies was to improve continuity of care and comprehensiveness, which resulted in increased patient satisfaction, increased primary care visits compared to specialist visits, and the provision of more health prevention education and improved prescribing practices. "
6537,2,"Technologies seem also to increase costs and utilization for some parameters, such as increased consultation costs and increased number of drugs prescribed."
6538,3,"Technologies and digital health have not played a major role within comprehensive innovation efforts aimed at enhancing primary care, reflecting that these technologies have not yet reached maturity or wider acceptance as a means for improving primary care. "
6539,3,"Stronger policy and financial support, and advocacy of key stakeholders are needed to encourage the introduction of efficient technological innovations, which are backed by evidence-based research, so that digital technologies can fulfill the promise of supporting strong sustainable primary care."
6540,4,Assessment of Psychological Distress in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Through Technologies: Literature Review
6541,0,"The use of technological devices can support the self-management of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly in addressing psychological distress. "
6542,0,"However, there is poor consistency in the literature regarding the use of psychological instruments for the web-based screening of patients' psychological distress and subsequent monitoring of their psychological condition during digital interventions."
6543,1,"The literature review was conducted using the PsycINFO, CINAHL and PubMed databases, in which the following terms were considered: diabetes mellitus, measure, assessment, self-care, self-management, depression, anxiety, stress, technology, eHealth, mobile health, mobile phone, device, and smartphone."
6544,2,"In most studies, psychological assessments were administered on paper. "
6545,2,"A few studies deployed self-reporting techniques employing automated telephonic assessment, a call system for screening and monitoring patients' conditions and preferences, or through telephone interviews via interactive voice response calls, a self-management support program leveraging tailored messages and structured emails. "
6546,2,Other studies used simple telephone interviews and included the use of apps for tablets and smartphones to assess the psychological well-being of patients. 
6547,2,"Finally, some studies deployed mood rating scales delivered through tailored text message-based support systems."
6548,3,"The deployment of appropriate psychological tools in digital interventions allows researchers and clinicians to make the screening of anxiety, stress, and depression symptoms faster and easier in patients with T2DM. "
6549,3,Data from this literature review suggest that mobile health solutions may be preferred tools to use in such digital interventions.
6550,4,A Novel Machine Learning Framework for Comparison of Viral COVID-19-Related Sina Weibo and Twitter Posts: Workflow Development and Content Analysis
6551,0,"Social media plays a critical role in health communications, especially during global health emergencies such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. "
6552,0,"However, there is a lack of a universal analytical framework to extract, quantify, and compare content features in public discourse of emerging health issues on different social media platforms across a broad sociocultural spectrum."
6553,1,"We sampled the 1000 most shared viral Twitter and Sina Weibo posts regarding COVID-19, developed a comprehensive coding scheme to identify 77 potential features across six major categories (eg, clinical and epidemiological, countermeasures, politics and policy, responses), quantified feature values (0 or 1, indicating whether or not the content feature is mentioned in the post) in each viral post across social media platforms, and performed subsequent comparative analyses. "
6554,1,Machine learning dimension reduction and clustering analysis were then applied to harness the power of social media data and provide more unbiased characterization of web-based health communications.
6555,2,"There were substantially different distributions, prevalence, and associations of content features in public discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic on the two social media platforms. "
6556,2,"Weibo users were more likely to focus on the disease itself and health aspects, while Twitter users engaged more about policy, politics, and other societal issues."
6557,3,We extracted a rich set of content features from social media data to accurately characterize public discourse related to COVID-19 in different sociocultural backgrounds. 
6558,3,"In addition, this universal framework can be adopted to analyze social media discussions of other emerging health issues beyond the COVID-19 pandemic."
6559,4,Readiness for Voice Technology in Patients With Cardiovascular Diseases: Cross-Sectional Study
6560,0,The clinical application of voice technology provides novel opportunities in the field of telehealth. 
6561,0,"However, patients' readiness for this solution has not been investigated among patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD)."
6562,1,"A cross-sectional study enrolled patients with chronic CVD who were surveyed using a validated investigator-designed questionnaire combining 19 questions (eg, demographic data, medical history, preferences for using telehealth services). "
6563,1,"Prior to the survey, respondents were educated on the telemedicine services presented in the questionnaire while being assisted by a medical doctor. "
6564,1,"Responses were then collected and analyzed, and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of willingness to use voice technology."
6565,2,"In total, 249 patients (mean age 65.3, SD 13.8 years; 158 [63.5%] men) completed the questionnaire, which showed good repeatability in the validation procedure. "
6566,2,"Of the 249 total participants, 209 (83.9%) reported high readiness to receive services allowing for remote contact with a cardiologist (176/249, 70.7%) and telemonitoring of vital signs (168/249, 67.5%). "
6567,2,The voice conversational agents combined with provider-driven support delivered by phone were shown to be highly anticipated by patients with CVD. 
6568,2,"The readiness to use telehealth was statistically higher in people with previous difficulties accessing health care (OR 2.920, 95% CI 1.377-6.192) and was most frequent in city residents and individuals reporting a higher education level. "
6569,2,"The age and sex of the respondents did not impact the intention to use voice technology (P=.20 and P=.50, respectively)."
6570,3,"Patients with cardiovascular diseases, including both younger and older individuals, declared high readiness for voice technology."
6571,4,"Computing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Risk From Symptoms, Imaging, and Test Data: Diagnostic Model Development"
6572,0,Assigning meaningful probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk presents a diagnostic challenge across the continuum of care.
6573,1,We integrated patient symptoms and test data using machine learning and Bayesian inference to quantify individual patient risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
6574,1,"We trained models with 100,000 simulated patient profiles based on 13 symptoms and estimated local prevalence, imaging, and molecular diagnostic performance from published reports. "
6575,1,We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID-19-compatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over the course of 14 days starting in March 2020.
6576,2,"We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (n=43, 78%) or cough (n=42, 77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11, 20%) or hospital care (n=44, 80%). "
6577,2,"In total, 51% (n=28) were female and 49% (n=27) were aged <60 years. "
6578,2,"Common comorbidities included diabetes (n=12, 22%), hypertension (n=15, 27%), cancer (n=9, 16%), and cardiovascular disease (n=7, 13%). "
6579,2,"Of these, 69% (n=38) were confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 20% (n=11) had repeated negative nucleic acid testing and an alternate diagnosis. "
6580,2,"Bayesian inference network, distance metric learning, and ensemble models discriminated between patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and alternate diagnoses with sensitivities of 81.6%-84.2%, specificities of 58.8%-70.6%, and accuracies of 61.4%-71.8%. "
6581,2,"After integrating imaging and laboratory test statistics with the predictions of the Bayesian inference network, changes in diagnostic uncertainty at each step in the simulated clinical evaluation process were highly sensitive to location, symptom, and diagnostic test choices."
6582,3,Decision support models that incorporate symptoms and available test results can help providers diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in real-world settings.
6583,4,Documenting Social Media Engagement as Scholarship: A New Model for Assessing Academic Accomplishment for the Health Professions
6584,0,"The traditional model of promotion and tenure in the health professions relies heavily on formal scholarship through teaching, research, and service. "
6585,0,Institutions consider how much weight to give activities in each of these areas and determine a threshold for advancement. 
6586,0,"With the emergence of social media, scholars can engage wider audiences in creative ways and have a broader impact. "
6587,0,Conventional metrics like the h-index do not account for social media impact. 
6588,0,Social media engagement is poorly represented in most curricula vitae (CV) and therefore is undervalued in promotion and tenure reviews.
6589,1,"To create unifying guidelines, we created a crowdsourced process that capitalized on the strengths of social media and generated a case example of successful use of the medium for academic collaboration. "
6590,1,The primary author created a draft of the guidelines and then sought input from users on Twitter via a publicly accessible Google Document. 
6591,1,"There was no limitation on who could provide input and the work was done in a democratic, collaborative fashion. "
6592,1,"Contributors edited the draft over a period of 1 week (September 12-18, 2020). "
6593,1,The primary and secondary authors then revised the draft to make it more concise. 
6594,1,The guidelines and manuscript were then distributed to the contributors for edits and adopted by the group. 
6595,1,All contributors were given the opportunity to serve as coauthors on the publication and were told upfront that authorship would depend on whether they were able to document the ways in which they met the 4 International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship criteria.
6596,2,"We developed 2 sets of guidelines: Guidelines for Listing All Social Media Scholarship Under Public Scholarship (in Research/Scholarship Section of CV) and Guidelines for Listing Social Media Scholarship Under Research, Teaching, and Service Sections of CV. "
6597,2,Institutions can choose which set fits their existing CV format.
6598,3,"With more uniformity, scholars can better represent the full scope and impact of their work. "
6599,3,These guidelines are not intended to dictate how individual institutions should weigh social media contributions within promotion and tenure cases. 
6600,3,"Instead, by providing an initial set of guidelines, we hope to provide scholars and their institutions with a common format and language to document social media scholarship."
6601,4,"Evaluation of the Immediate Effects of Web-Based Intervention Modules for Goals, Planning, and Coping Planning on Physical Activity: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial on Weight Loss Maintenance"
6602,0,The use of digital interventions can be accurately monitored via log files. 
6603,0,"However, monitoring engagement with intervention goals or enactment of the actual behaviors targeted by the intervention is more difficult and is usually evaluated based on pre-post measurements in a controlled trial."
6604,1,"The NoHoW Toolkit (TK), a digital intervention developed to support long-term weight loss maintenance, was evaluated in a 2 x 2 factorial randomized controlled trial. "
6605,1,"The TK contained various modules based on behavioral self-regulation and motivation theories, as well as contextual emotion regulation approaches, and involved continuous tracking of weight and physical activity through connected commercial devices (Fitbit Aria and Charge 2). "
6606,1,"Of the 4 trial arms, 2 had access to 2 modules directly targeting physical activity: a module for goal setting and action planning (Goal) and a module for identifying barriers and coping planning (Barriers). "
6607,1,Module visits and completion were determined based on TK log files and time spent in the module web page. 
6608,1,"Seven physical activity metrics (steps; activity; energy expenditure; fairly active, very active and total active minutes; and distance) were compared before and after visiting and completing the modules to examine whether the modules had immediate or sustained effects on physical activity Immediate effect was determined based on 7-day windows before and after the visit, and sustained effects were evaluated for 1 to 8 weeks after module completion."
6609,2,"Out of the 811 participants, 498 (61.4%) visited the Goal module and 406 (50.1%) visited the Barriers module. "
6610,2,"The Barriers module had an immediate effect on very active and total active minutes (very active minutes: before median 24.2, IQR 10.4-43.0 vs after median 24.9, IQR 10.0-46.3; P=.047; total active minutes: before median 45.1, IQR 22.9-74.9 vs after median 46.9, IQR 22.4-78.4; P=.03). "
6611,2,The differences were larger when only completed Barriers modules were considered. 
6612,2,The Barriers module completion was also associated with sustained effects in fairly active and total active minutes for most of the 8 weeks following module completion and for 3 weeks in very active minutes.
6613,3,"The Barriers module had small, significant, immediate, and sustained effects on active minutes measured by a wrist-worn activity tracker. "
6614,3,Future interventions should pay attention to assessing barriers and planning coping mechanisms to overcome them.
6615,4,"Efficacy, Benefits, and Harms of a Self-management App in a Swedish Trauma-Exposed Community Sample (PTSD Coach): Randomized Controlled Trial"
6616,0,Self-guided interventions may complement and overcome obstacles to in-person treatment options. 
6617,0,"The efficacy of app interventions targeting posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is unclear, and results from previous studies on PTSD Coach-an app for managing trauma-related distress-are inconsistent."
6618,1,Adults who had experienced potentially traumatic events in the past 2 years were randomized (1:1) to have access to PTSD Coach (n=89) or be on the waitlist (n=90). 
6619,1,We assessed clinical characteristics at baseline (semistructured interviews and self-rating scales) and after 3 months (self-rating scales). 
6620,1,"We analyzed the data in R software using linear mixed effects models, chi-square tests, and Fisher exact test."
6621,2,Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that access to PTSD Coach decreased posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms but not somatic symptoms. 
6622,2,More participants who had access to PTSD Coach responded with clinically significant improvement and fewer instances of probable PTSD after 3 months compared with waitlist controls. 
6623,2,"Overall, participants found that PTSD Coach was slightly to moderately helpful and moderately satisfactory. "
6624,2,"Half of the intervention group (36/71, 51%) reported at least one negative reaction related to using PTSD Coach (eg, disappointment with the app or its results, arousal of stress, or distressing memories)."
6625,3,"Using PTSD Coach may trigger symptoms among a few users; however, most of them perceived PTSD Coach as helpful and satisfactory. "
6626,3,This study showed that having access to PTSD Coach helped improve psychological trauma-related symptoms. 
6627,3,"In addition, we have discussed implications for future research and clinical practice."
6628,4,Improving Diagnosis Through Digital Pathology: Proof-of-Concept Implementation Using Smart Contracts and Decentralized File Storage
6629,0,"Recent advancements in digital pathology resulting from advances in imaging and digitization have increased the convenience and usability of pathology for disease diagnosis, especially in oncology, urology, and gastroenteric diagnosis. "
6630,0,"However, despite the possibilities to include low-cost diagnosis and viable telemedicine, digital pathology is not yet accessible owing to expensive storage, data security requirements, and network bandwidth limitations to transfer high-resolution images and associated data. "
6631,0,"The increase in storage, transmission, and security complexity concerning data collection and diagnosis makes it even more challenging to use artificial intelligence algorithms for machine-assisted disease diagnosis. "
6632,0,We designed and prototyped a digital pathology system that uses blockchain-based smart contracts using the nonfungible token (NFT) standard and the Interplanetary File System for data storage. 
6633,0,"Our design remediates shortcomings in the existing digital pathology systems infrastructure, which is centralized. "
6634,0,The proposed design is extendable to other fields of medicine that require high-fidelity image and data storage. 
6635,0,"Our solution is implemented in data systems that can improve access quality of care and reduce the cost of access to specialized pathological diagnosis, reducing cycle times for diagnosis."
6636,1,We used the design science research method consisting of 6 stages to inform our design overall. 
6637,1,We innovated over existing public-private designs for blockchains but using a 2-layered approach that separates actual file storage from metadata and data persistence.
6638,2,"Here, we identified key challenges to adopting digital pathology, including challenges concerning long-term storage and the transmission of information. "
6639,2,"Next, using accepted frameworks in NFT-based intelligent contracts and recent innovations in distributed secure storage, we proposed a decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving digital pathology system. "
6640,2,"Our design and prototype implementation using Solidity, web3.js, Ethereum, and node.js helped us address several challenges facing digital pathology. "
6641,2,"We demonstrated how our solution, which combines NFT smart contract standard with persistent decentralized file storage, solves most of the challenges of digital pathology and sets the stage for reducing costs and improving patient care and speed of diagnosis."
6642,3,We identified technical limitations that increase costs and reduce the mass adoption of digital pathology. 
6643,3,We presented several design innovations using NFT decentralized storage standards to prototype a system. 
6644,3,We also presented the implementation details of a unique security architecture for a digital pathology system. 
6645,3,"We illustrated how this design can overcome privacy, security, network-based storage, and data transmission limitations. "
6646,3,We illustrated how improving these factors sets the stage for improving data quality and standardized application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to such data.
6647,4,A Web-Based Self-assessment Model for Evaluating Multidisciplinary Cancer Teams in Spain: Development and Validation Pilot Study
6648,0,Tumor boards constitute the main consensus and clinical decision-making body of multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) in cancer care. 
6649,0,"With the increasing clinical complexity of treatment options (eg, targeted therapies, multimodal treatments) and the progressive incorporation of new areas of intervention (eg, survivorship care), tumor boards are now required to play a central role in all cancer processes. "
6650,0,"However, although frameworks are in place to evaluate MDT quality, only few web-based tools are available for this purpose; indeed, no web-based MDT evaluation tools have been developed for or adapted to the Spanish National Health System."
6651,1,We designed and validated the AEMAC program in 3 stages. 
6652,1,"In the first stage (research), we reviewed the available scientific evidence and performed a qualitative case study of good practice in multidisciplinary care within the Spanish National Health System (n=4 centers and 28 health care professionals). "
6653,1,"The results were used to define the thematic areas and quality criteria for the self-evaluation model, which were then discussed and validated by a group of experts. "
6654,1,The second stage (development) involved the technological development of a web app that would be accessible from any mobile device. 
6655,1,"In the third stage (piloting and validation), we conducted 4 pilot tests (n=15 tumor boards, 243 professionals) and used the results to analyze the acceptability and usefulness of the tool."
6656,2,"We designed a self-assessment model based on 5 thematic areas encompassing a total of 25 quality components, which users rated on a 3-option development scale. "
6657,2,"The evaluation process, which was managed entirely from the web app, consisted of individual self-assessment, group prioritization, and creation of an improvement plan. "
6658,2,"Cronbach alpha (.86), McDonald's omega (0.88), and various fit indices (comparative fit index between 0.95 and 1 and goodness-of-fit index between 0.97 and 0.99 for all 5 aspects) confirmed internal consistency. "
6659,2,The mean rating for overall satisfaction with the tool and for consistency between the content of the tool and the reality of tumor boards was 7.6 out of 10.
6660,3,The results obtained during the period of research and piloting of the AEMAC program showed that it has an appropriate structure and metric properties and could therefore be implemented in a real context and generalized to other hospitals. 
6661,3,"As a virtual tool, it helps to measure the key aspects of MDT quality, such as effectiveness of collaboration and communication, leadership, and the organizational environment."
6662,4,"Prevalence, Factors, and Association of Electronic Communication Use With Patient-Perceived Quality of Care From the 2019 Health Information National Trends Survey 5-Cycle 3: Exploratory Study"
6663,0,"Electronic communication (e-communication), referring to communication through electronic platforms such as the web, patient portal, or mobile phone, has become increasingly important, as it extends traditional in-person communication with fewer limitations of timing and locations. "
6664,0,"However, little is known about the current status of patients' use of e-communication with clinicians and whether the use is related to the better patient-perceived quality of care at the population level."
6665,1,"Data from 5438 adult responders (mean age 49.04 years, range 18-98 years) were included in this analysis. "
6666,1,Multiple logistic and linear regressions were conducted to explore responders'personal characteristics related to their use of e-communication with clinicians in the past 12 months and how their use was related to perceived quality of care. 
6667,1,Descriptive analyses for e-communication use according to age groups were also performed. 
6668,1,All analyses considered the complex survey design using the jackknife replication method.
6669,2,"The overall prevalence of e-communication use was 60.3%, with a significantly lower prevalence in older adults (16.6%) than that in <45-year-old adults (41%) and 45-65-year-old adults (42.4%). "
6670,2,"All percentages are weighted; therefore, absolute values are not shown. "
6671,2,"American adults who used e-communication were more likely to be high school graduates (odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% CI 1.14-3.34; P=.02), some college degree holders (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.84-6.05; P<.001), and college graduates or more (OR 4.89, 95% CI 2.67-8.95; P<.001). "
6672,2,"Further, people who were females (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.18-1.82; P=.001), with a household income >= US $50,000 (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23-2.16; P=.001), with more comorbidities (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.40; P=.004), or having a regular health care provider (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.98-3.47; P<.001), were more likely to use e-communication. "
6673,2,"In contrast, those who resided in rural areas (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.88; P=.009) were less likely to use e-communication. "
6674,2,"After controlling for the sociodemographics, the number of comorbidities, and relationship factors (ie, having a regular provider and trusting a doctor), e-communication use was found to be significantly associated with better perceived quality of care (beta=.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.22; P=.02)."
6675,3,"This study confirmed the positive association between e-communication use and patient-perceived quality of care and suggested that policy-level attention should be raised to engage the socially disadvantaged (ie, those with lower levels of education and income, without a regular health care provider, and living in rural areas) to maximize e-communication use and to support better patient-perceived quality of care among American adults."
6676,4,Energy Efficiency of Inference Algorithms for Clinical Laboratory Data Sets: Green Artificial Intelligence Study
6677,0,The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical domain has attracted considerable research interest. 
6678,0,Inference applications in the medical domain require energy-efficient AI models. 
6679,0,"In contrast to other types of data in visual AI, data from medical laboratories usually comprise features with strong signals. "
6680,0,Numerous energy optimization techniques have been developed to relieve the burden on the hardware required to deploy a complex learning model. 
6681,0,"However, the energy efficiency levels of different AI models used for medical applications have not been studied."
6682,1,"We applied the aforementioned algorithms to two distinct clinical laboratory data sets: a mass spectrometry data set regarding Staphylococcus aureus for predicting methicillin resistance (3338 cases; 268 features) and a urinalysis data set for predicting Trichomonas vaginalis infection (839,164 cases; 9 features). "
6683,1,"We compared the performance of the nine inference algorithms in terms of accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), time consumption, and power consumption. "
6684,1,The time and power consumption levels were determined using performance counter data from Intel Power Gadget 3.5.
6685,2,"The experimental results indicated that the RF and XGB algorithms achieved the two highest AUROC values for both data sets (84.7% and 83.9%, respectively, for the mass spectrometry data set; 91.1% and 91.4%, respectively, for the urinalysis data set). "
6686,2,"The XGB and LR algorithms exhibited the shortest inference time for both data sets (0.47 milliseconds for both in the mass spectrometry data set; 0.39 and 0.47 milliseconds, respectively, for the urinalysis data set). "
6687,2,"Compared with the RF algorithm, the XGB and LR algorithms exhibited a 45% and 53%-60% reduction in inference time for the mass spectrometry and urinalysis data sets, respectively. "
6688,2,"In terms of energy efficiency, the XGB algorithm exhibited the lowest power consumption for the mass spectrometry data set (9.42 Watts) and the LR algorithm exhibited the lowest power consumption for the urinalysis data set (9.98 Watts). "
6689,2,"Compared with a five-hidden-layer NN, the XGB and LR algorithms achieved 16%-24% and 9%-13% lower power consumption levels for the mass spectrometry and urinalysis data sets, respectively. "
6690,2,"In all experiments, the XGB algorithm exhibited the best performance in terms of accuracy, run time, and energy efficiency."
6691,3,"The XGB algorithm achieved balanced performance levels in terms of AUROC, run time, and energy efficiency for the two clinical laboratory data sets. "
6692,3,"Considering the energy constraints in real-world scenarios, the XGB algorithm is ideal for medical AI applications."
6693,4,Implementation of the Flexible Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) Model in Norway: eHealth Assessment Study
6694,0,Flexible Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) is a model for treatment of long-term severe mental disorders. 
6695,0,This method has become more widespread in Norway.
6696,1,"We have examined Norwegian policy regulating mental health services, laws and regulations, eHealth infrastructure, relevant literature on FACT teams, and current implementation of FACT in Norway."
6697,2,"FACT teams are a wanted part of the Norwegian service system, but the current eHealth infrastructure makes sharing of data within teams and levels of health care challenging, even if eHealth regulations allow such sharing. "
6698,2,This has been shown to be an issue in the current implementation of FACT teams in Norway. 
6699,2,There is little or no existing research on the eHealth challenges facing FACT teams.
6700,3,Weaknesses in the Norwegian eHealth infrastructure have been a barrier for an easy implementation of FACT teams in Norway. 
6701,3,It is difficult to share information between the different levels of health care. 
6702,3,"We need systems that allow for easy, secure sharing of health information to and between the FACT team members and other involved health care workers."
6703,4,Technology Acceptance of Home-Based Cardiac Telerehabilitation Programs in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease: Systematic Scoping Review
6704,0,"An understanding of the technology acceptance of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation programs is paramount if they are to be designed and delivered to target the needs and preferences of patients with coronary heart disease; however, the current state of technology acceptance of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation has not been systematically evaluated in the literature."
6705,1,"We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus (inception to July 2021) for English-language papers that reported empirical evidence on the technology acceptance of early-phase home-based cardiac telerehabilitation in patients with coronary heart disease. "
6706,1,Content analysis was undertaken.
6707,2,"The search identified 1798 studies, of which 18 studies, with 14 unique home-based cardiac telerehabilitation programs, met eligibility criteria. "
6708,2,Technology acceptance (of the home-based cardiac telerehabilitation programs) was mostly evaluated at intra-and posttrial stages using questionnaires (n=10) and usage data (n=11). 
6709,2,The least used approach was evaluation through qualitative interviews (n=3). 
6710,2,"Usability, utility, acceptability, and acceptance were generally favored. "
6711,2,"External variables that influenced home-based cardiac telerehabilitation usage included component quality, system quality, facilitating conditions, and intrinsic factors."
6712,3,"Home-based cardiac telerehabilitation usability, utility, acceptability, and acceptance were high; yet, a number of external variables influenced acceptance. "
6713,3,Findings and recommendations from this review can provide guidance for developing and evaluating patient-centered home-based cardiac telerehabilitation programs to stakeholders and clinicians.
6714,4,Evaluating the Effectiveness of Gamification on Physical Activity: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
6715,0,Gamification refers to the use of game elements in nongame contexts. 
6716,0,The use of gamification to change behaviors and promote physical activity (PA) is a promising avenue for tackling the global physical inactivity pandemic and the current prevalence of chronic diseases. 
6717,0,"However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of gamified interventions with the existence of mixed results in the literature."
6718,1,"A total of 5 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for randomized controlled trials published in English from 2010 to 2020. "
6719,1,"Eligibility criteria were based on the components of the participants, interventions, comparators, and outcomes framework. "
6720,1,Studies were included when they used gamified interventions in daily life with an active or inactive control group and when they assessed a PA or sedentary behavior outcome. 
6721,1,We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model approach. 
6722,1,"Sensitivity analyses, influence analyses, and publication bias analyses were performed to examine the robustness of our results."
6723,2,"The main meta-analysis performed on 16 studies and 2407 participants revealed a small to medium summary effect of gamified interventions on PA behavior (Hedges g=0.42, 95% CI 0.14-0.69). "
6724,2,"No statistical difference among different subgroups (adults vs adolescents and healthy participants vs adults with chronic diseases) and no interaction effects with moderators such as age, gender, or BMI were found, suggesting good generalizability of gamified interventions to different user populations. "
6725,2,"The effect was statistically significant when gamified interventions were compared with inactive control groups, such as waiting lists (Hedges g=0.58, 95% CI 0.08-1.07), and active control groups that included a nongamified PA intervention (Hedges g=0.23, 95% CI 0.05-0.41). "
6726,2,This suggests that gamified interventions are not only efficient in changing behavior but also more effective compared with other behavioral interventions. 
6727,2,"The long-term effect (measured with follow-up averaging 14 weeks after the end of the intervention) was weaker, with a very small to small effect (Hedges g=0.15, 95% CI 0.07-0.23)."
6728,3,This meta-analysis confirms that gamified interventions are promising for promoting PA in various populations. 
6729,3,"Additional analyses revealed that this effect persists after the follow-up period, suggesting that it is not just a novelty effect caused by the playful nature of gamification, and that gamified products appear effective compared with equivalent nongamified PA interventions. "
6730,3,Future rigorous trials are required to confirm these findings.
6731,4,Population Preferences for Performance and Explainability of Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: Choice-Based Conjoint Survey
6732,0,"Certain types of artificial intelligence (AI), that is, deep learning models, can outperform health care professionals in particular domains Such models hold considerable promise for improved diagnostics, treatment, and prevention, as well as more cost-efficient health care. "
6733,0,"They are, however, opaque in the sense that their exact reasoning cannot be fully explicated. "
6734,0,Different stakeholders have emphasized the importance of the transparency/explainability of AI decision making Transparency/explainability may come at the cost of performance. 
6735,0,There is need for a public policy regulating the use of AI in health care that balances the societal interests in high performance as well as in transparency/explainability. 
6736,0,A public policy should consider the wider public's interests in such features of AI.
6737,1,We conducted a choice-based conjoint survey of public preferences for attributes of AI decision making in health care in a representative sample of the adult Danish population. 
6738,1,"Initial focus group interviews yielded 6 attributes playing a role in the respondents' views on the use of AI decision support in health care: (1) type of AI decision, (2) level of explanation, (3) performance/accuracy, (4) responsibility for the final decision, (5) possibility of discrimination, and (6) severity of the disease to which the AI is applied. "
6739,1,"In total, 100 unique choice sets were developed using fractional factorial design. "
6740,1,"In a 12-task survey, respondents were asked about their preference for AI system use in hospitals in relation to 3 different scenarios."
6741,2,"Of the 1678 potential respondents, 1027 (61.2%) participated. "
6742,2,"The respondents consider the physician having the final responsibility for treatment decisions the most important attribute, with 46.8% of the total weight of attributes, followed by explainability of the decision (27.3%) and whether the system has been tested for discrimination (14.8%). "
6743,2,"Other factors, such as gender, age, level of education, whether respondents live rurally or in towns, respondents' trust in health and technology, and respondents' fears and hopes regarding AI, do not play a significant role in the majority of cases."
6744,3,"The 3 factors that are most important to the public are, in descending order of importance, (1) that physicians are ultimately responsible for diagnostics and treatment planning, (2) that the AI decision support is explainable, and (3) that the AI system has been tested for discrimination. "
6745,3,Public policy on AI system use in health care should give priority to such AI system use and ensure that patients are provided with information.
6746,4,A Risk-Based Clinical Decision Support System for Patient-Specific Antimicrobial Therapy (iBiogram): Design and Retrospective Analysis
6747,0,There is a pressing need for digital tools that can leverage big data to help clinicians select effective antibiotic treatments in the absence of timely susceptibility data. 
6748,0,Clinical presentation and local epidemiology can inform therapy selection to balance the risk of antimicrobial resistance and patient risk. 
6749,0,"However, data and clinical expertise must be appropriately integrated into clinical workflows."
6750,1,"We analyzed 5 years of susceptibility testing (1,078,510 isolates) and patient data (30,761 patients) across a large academic medical center. "
6751,1,"After curating the data according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, we analyzed and visualized the impact of risk factors on clinical outcomes. "
6752,1,"On the basis of this data-driven understanding, we developed a probabilistic algorithm that maps these data to individual cases and implemented iBiogram, a prototype digital empiric antimicrobial clinical decision support system, which we evaluated against actual prescribing outcomes."
6753,2,We determined patient-specific factors across syndromes and contexts and identified relevant local patterns of antimicrobial resistance by clinical syndrome. 
6754,2,Mortality and length of stay differed significantly depending on these factors and could be used to generate heuristic targets for an acceptable risk of underprescription. 
6755,2,"Combined with the developed remaining risk algorithm, these factors can be used to inform clinicians' reasoning. "
6756,2,"A retrospective comparison of the iBiogram-suggested therapies versus the actual prescription by physicians showed similar performance for low-risk diseases such as urinary tract infections, whereas iBiogram recognized risk and recommended more appropriate coverage in high mortality conditions such as sepsis."
6757,3,"The application of such data-driven, patient-centered tools may guide empirical prescription for clinicians to balance morbidity and mortality with antimicrobial stewardship."
6758,4,The Development of a Web-Based Tobacco Tracker Tool to Crowdsource Campus Environmental Reports for Smoke and Tobacco-Free College Policies: Mixed Methods Study
6759,0,College campuses in the United States have begun implementing smoke and tobacco-free policies to discourage the use of tobacco. 
6760,0,"Smoke and tobacco-free policies, however, are contingent upon effective policy enforcement."
6761,1,An exploratory sequential mixed methods approach was utilized to inform the development and evaluation of Tracker. 
6762,1,"In October 2018, three focus groups across 2 California universities were conducted and themes were analyzed, guiding Tracker development. "
6763,1,"After 1 year of implementation, users were asked in April 2020 to complete a survey about their experience."
6764,2,"In the focus groups, two major themes emerged: barriers and facilitators to tool utilization Further Tracker development was guided by focus group input to address these barriers (eg, information, policing, and logistical concerns) and facilitators (eg, environmental motivators and positive reinforcement). "
6765,2,"Amongst 1163 Tracker reports, those who completed the user survey (n=316) reported that the top motivations for using the tool had been having a cleaner environment (212/316, 79%) and health concerns (185/316, 69%)."
6766,3,"Environmental concerns, a motivator that emerged in focus groups, shaped Tracker's development and was cited by the majority of users surveyed as a top motivator for utilization."
6767,4,Health Care Providers Acceptance of a Personal Health Record: Cross-sectional Study
6768,0,"Personal health records (PHRs) are eHealth tools designed to support patient engagement, patient empowerment, and patient-and person-centered care. "
6769,0,Endorsement of a PHR by health care providers (HCPs) facilitates patient acceptance. 
6770,0,"As health care organizations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia begin to adopt PHRs, understanding the perspectives of HCPs is important because it can influence patient adoption. "
6771,0,"However, no studies evaluated HCPs' acceptance of PHRs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
6772,1,"This cross-sectional study was conducted among HCPs (physicians, pharmacists, nurses, technicians, others) utilizing a survey based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. "
6773,1,"The main theory constructs of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and positive attitude were considered independent variables. "
6774,1,Behavioral intention was the dependent variable. 
6775,1,"Age, years of experience, and professional role were tested as moderators between the main theory constructs and behavioral intention using partial least squares structural equation modeling."
6776,2,"Of the 291 participants, 246 were included in the final analysis. "
6777,2,"Behavioral intention to support PHR use among patients was significantly influenced by performance expectancy (beta=.17, P=.03) and attitude (beta=.61, P<.01). "
6778,2,No moderating effects were present.
6779,3,This study identified performance expectancy and attitude as predictors of HCPs' behavioral intention to recommend PHR to patients. 
6780,3,"To encourage HCPs to endorse PHRs, health care organizations should involve HCPs in the implementation and provide training on the features available as well as expected benefits. "
6781,3,Future studies should be conducted in other contexts and include other potential predictors.
6782,4,Assessing Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Structures and Outcomes Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Network Analysis Study
6783,0,Health care organizations (HCOs) adopt strategies (eg. 
6784,0,physical distancing) to protect clinicians and patients in intensive care units (ICUs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
6785,0,Many care activities physically performed before the COVID-19 pandemic have transitioned to virtual systems during the pandemic. 
6786,0,"These transitions can interfere with collaboration structures in the ICU, which may impact clinical outcomes. "
6787,0,Understanding the differences can help HCOs identify challenges when transitioning physical collaboration to the virtual setting in the post-COVID-19 era.
6788,1,"In this retrospective study, we applied network analysis to the utilization of electronic health records (EHRs) of 712 critically ill neonates (pre-COVID-19, n=386; intra-COVID-19, n=326, excluding those with COVID-19) admitted to the NICU of Vanderbilt University Medical Center between September 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, to assess collaboration between clinicians. "
6789,1,We characterized pre-COVID-19 as the period of September-December 2019 and intra-COVID-19 as the period of March-June 2020. 
6790,1,"These 2 groups were compared using patients' clinical characteristics, including age, sex, race, length of stay (LOS), and discharge dispositions. "
6791,1,We leveraged the clinicians' actions committed to the patients' EHRs to measure clinician-clinician connections. 
6792,1,We characterized a collaboration relationship (tie) between 2 clinicians as actioning EHRs of the same patient within the same day. 
6793,1,"On defining collaboration relationship, we built pre- and intra-COVID-19 networks. "
6794,1,"We used 3 sociometric measurements, including eigenvector centrality, eccentricity, and betweenness, to quantify a clinician's leadership, collaboration difficulty, and broad skill sets in a network, respectively. "
6795,1,"We assessed the extent to which the eigenvector centrality, eccentricity, and betweenness of clinicians in the 2 networks are statistically different, using Mann-Whitney U tests (95% CI)."
6796,2,Collaboration difficulty increased from the pre- to intra-COVID-19 periods (median eccentricity: 3 vs 4; P<.001). 
6797,2,"Nurses had reduced leadership (median eigenvector centrality: 0.183 vs 0.087; P<.001), and neonatologists with broader skill sets cared for more patients in the NICU structure during the pandemic (median betweenness centrality: 0.0001 vs 0.005; P<.001). "
6798,2,"The pre- and intra-COVID-19 patient groups shared similar distributions in sex (similar to 0 difference), race (4% difference in White, and 3% difference in African American), LOS (interquartile range difference in 1.5 days), and discharge dispositions (similar to 0 difference in home, 2% difference in expired, and 2% difference in others). "
6799,2,There were no significant differences in the patient demographics and outcomes between the 2 groups.
6800,3,Management of NICU-admitted patients typically requires multidisciplinary care teams. 
6801,3,Understanding collaboration structures can provide fine-grained evidence to potentially refine or optimize existing teamwork in the NICU.
6802,4,Effect of a Brief Web-Based Educational Intervention on Willingness to Consider Human Papillomavirus Vaccination for Children in Japan: Randomized Controlled Trial
6803,0,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rate in Japan has fallen to nearly zero since the suspension of governmental proactive recommendations in 2013, owing to the development of purported adverse events."
6804,1,"We recruited 1660 participants aged 20 years or older in March 2018 via a webpage and provided them with a 10-item questionnaire related to the following aspects: awareness regarding HPV infection and vaccination, willingness for immunization, and actions for prevention. "
6805,1,We randomly stratified participants based on sex and age with or without a brief educational intervention involving scientific information presented in an easy-to-read format.
6806,2,Only 484 (29.2%) of the respondents were aware of the benefits of HPV vaccination. 
6807,2,"Although only 352 (21.2%) of the respondents displayed a willingness for immunization of their daughters, there were 40 (4.8%) more respondents in the intervention group with this willingness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.69). "
6808,2,"In a subanalysis, the willingness toward vaccination for daughters in men was significantly higher in the intervention group (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05-2.02). "
6809,2,"However, such a difference was not observed among women (aOR 1.20, 95% CI 0.83-1.73)."
6810,3,"This study suggests that a brief web-based educational intervention increases the willingness of adults to consider the HPV vaccine for their children, especially among men. "
6811,3,"Thus, providing adequate information to men may be a useful strategy to improve the currently low rates of HPV vaccination."
6812,4,Using an Individual-Centered Approach to Gain Insights From Wearable Data in the Quantified Flu Platform: Netnography Study
6813,0,"Wearables have been used widely for monitoring health in general, and recent research results show that they can be used to predict infections based on physiological symptoms. "
6814,0,"To date, evidence has been generated in large, population-based settings. "
6815,0,"In contrast, the Quantified Self and Personal Science communities are composed of people who are interested in learning about themselves individually by using their own data, which are often gathered via wearable devices."
6816,1,We engaged in a cocreation and design process with an existing community of personal science practitioners to jointly develop a working prototype of a web-based tool for symptom tracking. 
6817,1,"In addition to the iterative creation of the prototype (started on March 16, 2020), we performed a netnographic analysis to investigate the process of how this prototype was created in a decentralized and iterative fashion."
6818,2,"The Quantified Flu prototype allowed users to perform daily symptom reporting and was capable of presenting symptom reports on a timeline together with resting heart rates, body temperature data, and respiratory rates measured by wearable devices. "
6819,2,"We observed a high level of engagement; over half of the users (52/92, 56%) who engaged in symptom tracking became regular users and reported over 3 months of data each. "
6820,2,"Furthermore, our netnographic analysis highlighted how the current Quantified Flu prototype was a result of an iterative and continuous cocreation process in which new prototype releases sparked further discussions of features and vice versa."
6821,3,"As shown by the high level of user engagement and iterative development process, an open cocreation process can be successfully used to develop a tool that is tailored to individual needs, thereby decreasing dropout rates."
6822,4,Machine Learning Analysis of Time-Dependent Features for Predicting Adverse Events During Hemodialysis Therapy: Model Development and Validation Study
6823,0,Hemodialysis (HD) therapy is an indispensable tool used in critical care management. 
6824,0,"Patients undergoing HD are at risk for intradialytic adverse events, ranging from muscle cramps to cardiac arrest. "
6825,0,"So far, there is no effective HD device-integrated algorithm to assist medical staff in response to these adverse events a step earlier during HD."
6826,1,Three-month dialysis and physiological time-series data were collected from all patients who underwent maintenance HD therapy at a tertiary care referral center. 
6827,1,"Dialysis data were collected automatically by HD devices, and physiological data were recorded by medical staff. "
6828,1,Intradialytic adverse events were documented by medical staff according to patient complaints. 
6829,1,Features extracted from the time series data sets by linear and differential analyses were used for machine learning to predict adverse events during HD.
6830,2,Time series dialysis data were collected during the 4-hour HD session in 108 patients who underwent maintenance HD therapy. 
6831,2,"There were a total of 4221 HD sessions, 406 of which involved at least one intradialytic adverse event. "
6832,2,Models were built by classification algorithms and evaluated by four-fold cross-validation. 
6833,2,"The developed algorithm predicted overall intradialytic adverse events, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83, sensitivity of 0.53, and specificity of 0.96. "
6834,2,"The algorithm also predicted muscle cramps, with an AUC of 0.85, and blood pressure elevation, with an AUC of 0.93. "
6835,2,"In addition, the model built based on ultrafiltration-unrelated features predicted all types of adverse events, with an AUC of 0.81, indicating that ultrafiltration-unrelated factors also contribute to the onset of adverse events."
6836,3,Our results demonstrated that algorithms combining linear and differential analyses with two-class classification machine learning can predict intradialytic adverse events in quasi-real time with high AUCs. 
6837,3,Such a methodology implemented with local cloud computation and real-time optimization by personalized HD data could warn clinicians to take timely actions in advance.
6838,4,Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Diminutive Colorectal Polyps in Endoscopic Images: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy
6839,0,"Most colorectal polyps are diminutive and benign, especially those in the rectosigmoid colon, and the resection of these polyps is not cost-effective. "
6840,0,Advancements in image-enhanced endoscopy have improved the optical prediction of colorectal polyp histology. 
6841,0,"However, subjective interpretability and inter- and intraobserver variability prohibits widespread implementation. "
6842,0,"The number of studies on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is increasing; however, their small sample sizes limit statistical significance."
6843,1,"Core databases were searched for studies that were based on endoscopic imaging, used CAD models for the histologic diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps, and presented data on diagnostic performance. "
6844,1,A systematic review and diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis were performed.
6845,2,"Overall, 13 studies were included. "
6846,2,"The pooled area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of CAD models for the diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps (adenomatous or neoplastic vs nonadenomatous or nonneoplastic) were 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.97), 0.93 (95% CI 0.91-0.95), 0.87 (95% CI 0.76-0.93), and 87 (95% CI 38-201), respectively. "
6847,2,"The meta-regression analysis showed no heterogeneity, and no publication bias was detected. "
6848,2,Subgroup analyses showed robust results. 
6849,2,"The negative predictive value of CAD models for the diagnosis of adenomatous polyps in the rectosigmoid colon was 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97), and this value exceeded the threshold of the diagnosis and leave strategy."
6850,3,CAD models show potential for the optical histological diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps via the use of endoscopic images.
6851,4,Health Information Technology Use Among Persons With Self-reported Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease: Analysis of the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey
6852,0,Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. 
6853,0,Health information technologies (HITs) have recently emerged as a viable intervention to mitigate the burden of ASCVD. 
6854,0,"Approximately 60% of US adults report searching the internet for health information; however, previous research has not examined the prevalence of general technology or HIT use among adults with and without ASCVD. "
6855,0,"In addition, social determinants in HIT use among adults with ASCVD are not well understood."
6856,1,"We pooled cross-sectional data from the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to examine the general technology and HIT use among adults aged >= 18 years with and without self-reported ASCVD (coronary heart disease, stroke, or both). "
6857,1,"General technology use was defined as mobile phone ownership, internet use, and computer use. "
6858,1,"HIT use was defined as looking up health information on the internet, filling a web-based prescription, scheduling a medical appointment on the internet, communicating with a health care provider by email, or using web-based group chats to learn about health topics. "
6859,1,We evaluated sociodemographic differences in HIT use among respondents by using Poisson regression. 
6860,1,Analyses were weighted according to NHIS standards.
6861,2,"A total sample of 256,117 individuals were included, of which 2194 (0.9%) reported prior ASCVD. "
6862,2,"Among adults with prior ASCVD, the mean age was 70.6 (SD 11.5) years, and 47.4% (1048/2194) of the adults were females. "
6863,2,"General technology use differed between participants with and without prior ASCVD, with 36.0% (614/1826) and 76.2% (157,642/213,816) indicating internet usage and 24.6% (374/1575) and 60.7% (107,742/184,557) indicating using a computer every day, respectively. "
6864,2,"Similarly, adults with ASCVD were less likely to use HIT than those without ASCVD (515/2194, 25.1% vs 123,966/253,923, 51.0%; P <.001). "
6865,2,"Among adults with prior ASCVD, social determinants that were associated with HIT use included younger age, higher education, higher income, being employed, and being married."
6866,3,"HIT use was low among adults with a history of ASCVD, which may represent a barrier to delivering care via emerging HIT. "
6867,3,"Given the associations with social determinants such as income, education, and employment, targeted strategies and policies are needed to eliminate barriers to impact HIT usage."
6868,4,Some Benchmark Searches for Testing Search Capabilities and Medical Coverage of Internet Discovery Tools
6869,0,The past few years have seen an increase in interest in sharing visit notes with patients. 
6870,0,"Sharing visit notes with patients is also known as ""open notes."" Shared notes are seen as beneficial for patient empowerment and communication, but concerns have also been raised about potential negative effects. "
6871,0,"Understanding barriers is essential to successful organizational change, but most published studies on the topic come from countries where shared notes are incentivized or legally required."
6872,1,This multimethodological study was conducted in an academic and a nonacademic hospital in the Netherlands. 
6873,1,We conducted a survey of patients and doctors in March-April 2019. 
6874,1,"In addition to the survey, we conducted think-aloud interviews to gather more insight into the reasons behind participants' answers. "
6875,1,"We surveyed 350 physicians and 99 patients, and think-aloud interviews were conducted with an additional 13 physicians and 6 patients."
6876,2,"Most patients (81/98, 77%) were interested in viewing their visit notes, whereas most physicians (262/345, 75.9%) were opposed to allowing patients to view their visit notes. "
6877,2,"Most patients (54/90, 60%) expected the notes to be written in layman's terms, but most physicians (193/321, 60.1%) did not want to change their writing style to make it more understandable for patients. "
6878,2,"Doctors raised concerns that reading the note would make patients feel confused and anxious, that the patient would not understand the note, and that shared notes would result in more documentation time or losing a way to communicate with colleagues. "
6879,2,Interviews also revealed concerns about documenting sensitive topics such as suspected abuse and unlikely but worrisome differential diagnoses. 
6880,2,Physicians also raised concerns that documenting worrisome thoughts elsewhere in the record would result in fragmentation of the patient record. 
6881,2,"Patients were uncertain if they would understand the notes (46/90, 51%) and, in interviews, raised questions about security and privacy. "
6882,2,"Physicians did anticipate some benefits, such as the patients remembering the visit better, shared decision-making, and keeping patients informed, but 24% (84/350) indicated that they saw no benefit. "
6883,2,"Patients anticipated that they would remember the visit better, feel more in control, and better understand their health."
6884,3,"Dutch patients are interested in shared visit notes, but physicians have many concerns that should be addressed if shared notes are pursued. "
6885,3,Physicians' concerns should be addressed before shared notes are implemented. 
6886,3,"In hospitals where shared notes are implemented, the effects should be monitored (objectively, if possible) to determine whether the concerns raised by our participants have actualized into problems and whether the anticipated benefits are being realized."
6887,4,"Turn on, Tune in, and Drop out: Predictors of Attrition in a Prospective Observational Cohort Study on Psychedelic Use"
6888,0,"The resurgence of research and public interest in the positive psychological effects of psychedelics, together with advancements in digital data collection techniques, have brought forth a new type of research design, which involves prospectively gathering large-scale naturalistic data from psychedelic users; that is, before and after the use of a psychedelic compound. "
6889,0,"A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. "
6890,0,"Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results."
6891,1,"Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. "
6892,1,"Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience."
6893,2,"Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (beta=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (beta=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (beta=0.082; P=.01). "
6894,2,"Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout."
6895,3,"The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. "
6896,3,"Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data."
6897,4,Human Enough: A Qualitative Study of Client Experience With Internet-Based Access to Pre-exposure Prophylaxis
6898,0,HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a way to prevent HIV infection using antiretroviral medications. 
6899,0,"However, common barriers to PrEP engagement include lack of access to prescribers; discomfort seeking sexual health services; and racism, homophobia, and transphobia in medical contexts. "
6900,0,"Key populations (eg, communities of color, young men who have sex with men, and transgender women) are underrepresented in terms of PrEP uptake in the United States. "
6901,0,Nurx is an innovative company that has offered internet-based access to PrEP since 2016.
6902,1,"An electronic chart review and semistructured interviews were conducted with 31 PrEP requesters from California, Florida, Illinois, and New York. "
6903,1,"Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to inductive and deductive thematic analysis."
6904,2,Some interviewees reported initial skepticism about whether a web-based PrEP service could be legitimate or feasible. 
6905,2,"Despite this, most clients were effusive about their eventual Nurx experience, and many reported that Nurx eased barriers to PrEP access through the availability of knowledgeable, willing prescribers and minimizing embarrassment and discrimination. "
6906,2,Our analysis suggests Nurx produced satisfaction by achieving an acceptable balance between 2 client desires: efficiency and humanity. 
6907,2,"Efficiency encompasses the simplicity, speed, and convenience of obtaining PrEP, both regarding the Nurx process itself and in comparison with in-person encounters. "
6908,2,"Humanity covers clients' wish for personalized, responsive interaction and a feeling of connection or care. "
6909,2,Nurx's messaging platform was crucial to manifesting these qualities and was largely interpreted through the familiar frame of texting. 
6910,2,Clients conceived efficiency and humanity as inversely related in a commercial enterprise and varied in the particular balance they felt was optimal. 
6911,2,Those who wished for slightly more humanity than the service afforded used the concept of a trade-off to explain why Nurx remained appealing.
6912,3,Our findings augment evidence that internet-based PrEP provision can broaden access to this HIV prevention strategy. 
6913,3,"That important finding notwithstanding, a few provisos merit mention. "
6914,3,"Telehealth, as practiced by Nurx, was still dependent on culturally competent medical providers as system inputs, and the very technology used to overcome access barriers (ie, the internet) generated new hurdles for some clients. "
6915,3,"Furthermore, clients did not interpret Nurx in a vacuum: their past experiences and the social and structural context mattered. "
6916,3,"Finally, only granular inquiry revealed precisely how Nurx satisfied clients whose experiences and preferences fell within a particular range. "
6917,3,"Extrapolating from this, we urge scholars not to fetishize technological solutions but rather to interrogate the ways in which any intervention's design works for certain kinds of patients."
6918,4,Integrating Patient Data Into Skin Cancer Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks: Systematic Review
6919,0,Recent years have been witnessing a substantial improvement in the accuracy of skin cancer classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
6920,0,CNNs perform on par with or better than dermatologists with respect to the classification tasks of single images. 
6921,0,"However, in clinical practice, dermatologists also use other patient data beyond the visual aspects present in a digitized image, further increasing their diagnostic accuracy. "
6922,0,Several pilot studies have recently investigated the effects of integrating different subtypes of patient data into CNN-based skin cancer classifiers.
6923,1,"Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, and ScienceDirect were screened for peer-reviewed studies published in English that dealt with the integration of patient data within a CNN-based skin cancer classification. "
6924,1,"The search terms skin cancer classification, convolutional neural network(s), deep learning, lesions, melanoma, metadata, clinical information, and patient data were combined."
6925,2,A total of 11 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 
6926,2,All of them reported an overall improvement in different skin lesion classification tasks with patient data integration. 
6927,2,"The most commonly used patient data were age, sex, and lesion location. "
6928,2,The patient data were mostly one-hot encoded. 
6929,2,There were differences in the complexity that the encoded patient data were processed with regarding deep learning methods before and after fusing them with the image features for a combined classifier.
6930,3,This study indicates the potential benefits of integrating patient data into CNN-based diagnostic algorithms. 
6931,3,"However, how exactly the individual patient data enhance classification performance, especially in the case of multiclass classification problems, is still unclear. "
6932,3,"Moreover, a substantial fraction of patient data used by dermatologists remains to be analyzed in the context of CNN-based skin cancer classification. "
6933,3,Further exploratory analyses in this promising field may optimize patient data integration into CNN based skin cancer diagnostics for patients' benefits.
6934,4,The Use of Information and Communication Technologies by Sex Workers to Manage Occupational Health and Safety: Scoping Review
6935,0,"In many countries, sex work is criminalized, driving sex work underground and leaving sex workers vulnerable to a number of occupational health and safety risks, including violence, assault, and robbery. "
6936,0,"With the advent of widely accessible information and communication technologies (ICTs), sex workers have begun to use electronic occupational health and safety tools to mitigate these risks."
6937,1,A literature review following the methodological framework for scoping reviews was conducted to analyze studies describing the use of ICTs by sex workers to mitigate occupational health and safety risks. 
6938,1,"Experimental, observational, and descriptive studies, as well as protocol papers, were included in this scoping review."
6939,2,"Of the 2477 articles initially identified, 41 (1.66%) met the inclusion criteria. "
6940,2,"Of these studies, 71% (29/41) were published between 2015 and 2019. "
6941,2,"In these studies, the internet was the predominant ICT (24/41, 58%), followed by text messaging (10/41, 24%) and assorted communication technologies associated with mobile phones without internet access (7/41, 17%; eg, voice mail). "
6942,2,"In 56% (23/41) of the studies, sex workers located in high-income countries created occupational health and safety strategies (eg, bad date lists) and shared them through the internet. "
6943,2,"In 24% (10/41) of the studies, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, organizations external to sex work developed and sent (through text messages) occupational health and safety strategies focused on HIV. "
6944,2,"In 20% (8/41) of the studies, external organizations collaborated with the sex worker community in the development of occupational health and safety strategies communicated through ICTs; through this collaboration, concerns other than HIV (eg, mental health) emerged."
6945,3,"Although there has been an increase in the number of studies on the use of ICTs by sex workers for managing occupational health and safety over the past 5 years, knowledge of how to optimally leverage ICTs for this purpose remains scarce. "
6946,3,"Recommendations for expanding the use of ICTs by sex workers for occupational health and safety include external organizations collaborating with sex workers in the design of ICT interventions to mitigate occupational health and safety risks; to examine whether ICTs used in low- and middle-income countries would have applications in high-income countries as a substitute to the internet for sharing occupational health and safety strategies; and to explore the creation of innovative, secure, web-based communities that use existing or alternative digital technologies that could be used by sex workers to manage their occupational health and safety."
6947,4,Design and Implementation of a Real-time Monitoring Platform for Optimal Sepsis Care in an Emergency Department: Observational Cohort Study
6948,0,Sepsis is the leading cause of death in US hospitals. 
6949,0,"Compliance with bundled care, specifically serial lactates, blood cultures, and antibiotics, improves outcomes but is often delayed or missed altogether in a busy practice environment."
6950,1,"This single-center, prospective, observational study was conducted in three phases: the design and technical development phase to build an initial version of the platform; the pilot phase to test and refine the platform in the clinical setting; and the postpilot rollout phase to fully implement the study intervention."
6951,2,"During the design and technical development, study team members and stakeholders identified the criteria for patient inclusion, selected bundle measures from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Sepsis Core Measure for alerting, and defined alert thresholds, message content, delivery mechanisms, and recipients. "
6952,2,"Additional refinements were made based on 70 provider survey results during the pilot phase, including removing alerts for vasopressor initiation and modifying text in the pages to facilitate patient identification. "
6953,2,"During the 48 days of the postpilot rollout phase, 15,770 ED encounters were tracked and 711 patient encounters were included in the active monitoring cohort. "
6954,2,"In total, 634 pages were sent at a rate of 0.98 per attending physician shift. "
6955,2,"Overall, 38.3% (272/711) patients had at least one page. "
6956,2,"The missing bundle elements that triggered alerts included: antibiotics 41.6% (136/327), repeat lactate 32.4% (106/327), blood cultures 20.8% (68/327), and initial lactate 5.2% (17/327). "
6957,2,"Of the missing Sepsis Core Measures elements for which a page was sent, 38.2% (125/327) were successfully completed on time."
6958,3,A real-time sepsis care monitoring and alerting platform was created for the ED environment. 
6959,3,"The high proportion of patients with at least one alert suggested the significant potential for such a platform to improve care, whereas the overall number of alerts per clinician suggested a low risk of alarm fatigue. "
6960,3,The study intervention warrants a more rigorous evaluation to ensure that the added alerts lead to better outcomes for patients with sepsis.
6961,4,Public Interest in Immunity and the Justification for Intervention in the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Analysis of Google Trends Data
6962,0,The use of social big data is an important emerging concern in public health. 
6963,0,Internet search volumes are useful data that can sensitively detect trends of the public's attention during a pandemic outbreak situation.
6964,1,"To assess the level of public interest in infectious diseases during the initial days of the COVID-19 outbreak, we extracted Google search data from January 20, 2020, onward and compared them to data from March 15, 2020, which was approximately 2 months after the COVID-19 outbreak began. "
6965,1,"In order to determine whether the public became interested in the immune system, we selected coronavirus, immune, and vitamin as our final search terms."
6966,2,"The increase in the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases that occurred after January 20, 2020, had a strong positive correlation with the search volumes for the terms coronavirus (R=0.786; P<.001), immune (R=0.745; P<.001), and vitamin (R=0.778; P<.001), and the correlations between variables were all mutually statistically significant. "
6967,2,"Moreover, these correlations were confirmed on a country basis when we restricted our analyses to the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Korea. "
6968,2,Our findings revealed that increases in search volumes for the terms coronavirus and immune preceded the actual occurrences of confirmed cases.
6969,3,"Our study shows that during the initial phase of the COVID-19 crisis, the public's desire and actions of strengthening their own immune systems were enhanced. "
6970,3,"Further, in the early stage of a pandemic, social media platforms have a high potential for informing the public about potentially helpful measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and provide relevant information about immunity, thereby increasing the public's knowledge."
6971,4,Perceptions of Racially and Ethnically Diverse Women at High Risk of Breast Cancer Regarding the Use of a Web-Based Decision Aid for Chemoprevention: Qualitative Study Nested Within a Randomized Controlled Trial
6972,0,Chemopreventive agents such as selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors have proven efficacy in reducing breast cancer risk by 41% to 79% in high-risk women. 
6973,0,Women at high risk of developing breast cancer face the complex decision of whether to take selective estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer chemoprevention. 
6974,0,"RealRisks is a patient-centered, web-based decision aid (DA) designed to promote the understanding of breast cancer risk and to engage diverse women in planning a preference-sensitive course of decision making about taking chemoprevention."
6975,1,We completed enrollment to a randomized controlled trial among 300 racially and ethnically diverse women at high risk of breast cancer who were assigned to standard educational materials alone or such materials in combination with RealRisks. 
6976,1,"We conducted semistructured interviews with a subset of 21 high-risk women enrolled in the intervention arm of the randomized controlled trial who initially accessed the tool (on average, 1 year earlier) to understand how they interacted with the tool. "
6977,1,"All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and compared with digital audio recordings to ensure the accuracy of the content. "
6978,1,We used content analysis to generate themes.
6979,2,The mean age of the 21 participants was 58.5 (SD 10.1) years. 
6980,2,"The participants were 5% (1/21) Asian, 24% (5/21) Black or African American, and 71% (15/21) White; 10% (2/21) of participants were Hispanic or Latina. "
6981,2,All participants reported using RealRisks after being granted access to the DA. 
6982,2,"In total, 4 overarching themes emerged from the qualitative analyses: the acceptability of the intervention, specifically endorsed elements of the DA, recommendations for improvements, and information needs. "
6983,2,"All women found RealRisks to be acceptable and considered it to be helpful (21/21, 100%). "
6984,2,"Most women (13/21, 62%) reported that RealRisks was easy to navigate, user-friendly, and easily accessible on the web. "
6985,2,"The majority of women (18/21, 86%) felt that RealRisks improved their knowledge about breast cancer risk and chemoprevention options and that RealRisks informed their (17/21, 81%) decision about whether or not to take chemoprevention. "
6986,2,"Some women (9/21, 43%) shared recommendations for improvements, as they wanted more tailoring based on user characteristics, felt that the DA was targeting a narrow population of Hispanic or Latina by using graphic novel-style narratives, wanted more understandable terminology, and felt that the tool placed a strong emphasis on chemoprevention drugs."
6987,3,"This qualitative study demonstrated the acceptability of the RealRisks web-based DA among a diverse group of high-risk women, who provided some recommendations for improvement."
6988,4,Patient-Centered Care: Transforming the Health Care System in Vietnam With Support of Digital Health Technology
6989,0,"Over the recent decades, Vietnam has attained remarkable achievements in all areas of health care. "
6990,0,"However, shortcomings including health disparities persist particularly with a rapidly aging population. "
6991,0,"This has resulted in a shift in the disease burden from communicable to noncommunicable diseases such as dementia, cancer, and diabetes. "
6992,0,"These medical conditions require long-term care, which causes an accelerating crisis for the health sector and society. "
6993,0,The current health care system in Vietnam is unlikely to cope with these challenges.
6994,1,"We examine the applicability of a personalized and integrated Bespoke Health Care System (BHS) for Vietnam using a strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat analysis and examining the successes or failures of digital health care innovations in Vietnam. "
6995,1,We then make suggestions for successful adoption of the BHS model in Vietnam.
6996,2,The BHS model of patient-centered care empowers patients to become active participants in their own health care. 
6997,2,"Vietnam's current policy, social, technological, and economic environment favors the transition of its health care system toward the BHS model. "
6998,2,"Nevertheless, the country is in an early stage of health care digitalization. "
6999,2,The legal and regulatory system to protect patient privacy and information security is still lacking. 
7000,2,"The readiness to implement electronic medical records, a core element of the BHS, varies across health providers and clinical practices. "
7001,2,"The scarcity of empirical evidence and evaluation regarding the effectiveness and sustainability of digital health initiatives is an obstacle to the Vietnamese government in policymaking, development, and implementation of health care digitalization."
7002,3,"Implementing a personalized and integrated health care system may help Vietnam to address health care needs, reduce pressure on the health care system and society, improve health care delivery, and promote health equity. "
7003,3,"However, in order to adopt the patient-centered care system and digitalized health care, a whole-system approach in transformation and operation with a co-design in the whole span of a digital health initiative developing process are necessary."
7004,4,Reliable Prediction Models Based on Enriched Data for Identifying the Mode of Childbirth by Using Machine Learning Methods: Development Study
7005,0,"The use of artificial intelligence has revolutionized every area of life such as business and trade, social and electronic media, education and learning, manufacturing industries, medicine and sciences, and every other sector. "
7006,0,The new reforms and advanced technologies of artificial intelligence have enabled data analysts to transmute raw data generated by these sectors into meaningful insights for an effective decision-making process. 
7007,0,"Health care is one of the integral sectors where a large amount of data is generated daily, and making effective decisions based on these data is therefore a challenge. "
7008,0,"In this study, cases related to childbirth either by the traditional method of vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery were investigated. "
7009,0,Cesarean delivery is performed to save both the mother and the fetus when complications related to vaginal birth arise.
7010,1,"This study was conducted in 2 parts for identifying the mode of childbirth: first, the existing data set was enriched and second, previous medical records about the mode of delivery were investigated using machine learning algorithms and by extracting meaningful insights from unseen cases. "
7011,1,"Several prediction models were trained to achieve this objective, such as decision tree, random forest, AdaBoostM1, bagging, and k-nearest neighbor, based on original and enriched data sets."
7012,2,"The prediction models based on enriched data performed well in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, and receiver operating characteristic curves in the outcomes. "
7013,2,"Specifically, the accuracy of k-nearest neighbor was 84.38%, that of bagging was 83.75%, that of random forest was 83.13%, that of decision tree was 81.25%, and that of AdaBoostM1 was 80.63%. "
7014,2,"Enrichment of the data set had a good impact on improving the accuracy of the prediction process, which supports maternity care practitioners in making decisions in critical cases."
7015,3,"Our study shows that enriching the data set improves the accuracy of the prediction process, thereby supporting maternity care practitioners in making informed decisions in critical cases. "
7016,3,"The enriched data set used in this study yields good results, but this data set can become even better if the records are increased with real clinical data."
7017,4,Quality and Adoption of COVID-19 Tracing Apps and Recommendations for Development: Systematic Interdisciplinary Review of European Apps
7018,0,Simulation study results suggest that COVID-19 contact tracing apps have the potential to achieve pandemic control. 
7019,0,"Concordantly, high app adoption rates were a stipulated prerequisite for success. "
7020,0,Early studies on potential adoption were encouraging. 
7021,0,"Several factors predicting adoption rates were investigated, especially pertaining to user characteristics. "
7022,0,"Since then, several countries have released COVID-19 contact tracing apps."
7023,1,"Eligible COVID-19 contact tracing apps were those released by national health authorities of European Union member states, former member states, and countries of the European Free Trade Association, all countries with comparable legal standards concerning personal data protection and app use voluntariness. "
7024,1,The Mobile App Rating Scale was used to assess app quality. 
7025,1,"An interdisciplinary team, consisting of two health and two human-computer interaction scientists, independently conducted Mobile App Rating Scale ratings. "
7026,1,"To investigate associations between app quality and adoption rates and infection rates, Bayesian linear regression analyses were conducted."
7027,2,"We discovered 21 national COVID-19 contact tracing apps, all demonstrating high quality overall and high-level functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. "
7028,2,"However, the average app adoption rate of 22.9% (SD 12.5%) was below the level recommended by simulation studies. "
7029,2,"Lower levels of engagement-oriented app design were detected, with substantial variations between apps. "
7030,2,"By regression analyses, the best-case adoption rate was calculated by assuming apps achieve the highest ratings. "
7031,2,"The mean best-case adoption rates for engagement and overall app quality were 39.5% and 43.6%, respectively. "
7032,2,Higher adoption rates were associated with lower cumulative infection rates. 
7033,2,"Overall, we identified 5 feature categories (symptom assessment and monitoring, regularly updated information, individualization, tracing, and communication) and 14 individual features that contributed to higher app quality. "
7034,2,"These 14 features were a symptom checker, a symptom diary, statistics on COVID-19, app use, public health instructions and restrictions, information of burden on health care system, assigning personal data, regional updates, control over tracing activity, contact diary, venue check-in, chats, helplines, and app-sharing capacity."
7035,3,"European national health authorities have generally released high quality COVID-19 contact tracing apps, with regard to functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. "
7036,3,"However, the app's engagement-oriented design generally was of lower quality, even though regression analyses results identify engagement as a promising optimization target to increase adoption rates. "
7037,3,"Associations between higher app adoption and lower infection rates are consistent with simulation study results, albeit acknowledging that app use might be part of a broader set of protective attitudes and behaviors for self and others. "
7038,3,Various features were identified that could guide further engagement-enhancing app development.
7039,4,Information-Seeking Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic Across the United States: Longitudinal Analysis of Google Trends Data
7040,0,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people's lives at unprecedented speed and scale, including how they eat and work, what they are concerned about, how much they move, and how much they can earn. "
7041,0,"Traditional surveys in the area of public health can be expensive and time-consuming, and they can rapidly become outdated. "
7042,0,The analysis of big data sets (such as electronic patient records and surveillance systems) is very complex. 
7043,0,"Google Trends is an alternative approach that has been used in the past to analyze health behaviors; however, most existing studies on COVID-19 using these data examine a single issue or a limited geographic area. "
7044,0,"This paper explores Google Trends as a proxy for what people are thinking, needing, and planning in real time across the United States."
7045,1,"We analyzed searches on 38 terms related to COVID-19, falling into six themes: social and travel; care seeking; government programs; health programs; news and influence; and outlook and concerns. "
7046,1,"We generated data sets at the national level (covering January 1, 2016, to April 15, 2020) and state level (covering January 1 to April 15, 2020). "
7047,1,"Methods used include trend analysis of US search data; geographic analyses of the differences in search popularity across US states from March 1 to April 15, 2020; and principal component analysis to extract search patterns across states."
7048,2,"The data showed high demand for information, corresponding with increasing searches for coronavirus linked to news sources regardless of the ideological leaning of the news source. "
7049,2,Changes in information seeking often occurred well in advance of action by the federal government. 
7050,2,The popularity of searches for unemployment claims predicted the actual spike in weekly claims. 
7051,2,"The increase in searches for information on COVID-19 care was paralleled by a decrease in searches related to other health behaviors, such as urgent care, doctor's appointments, health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. "
7052,2,"Finally, concerns varied across the country; some search terms were more popular in some regions than in others."
7053,3,COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last pandemic faced by the United States. 
7054,3,Our research holds important lessons for both state and federal governments in a fast-evolving situation that requires a finger on the pulse of public sentiment. 
7055,3,We suggest strategic shifts for policy makers to improve the precision and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and recommend the development of a real-time dashboard as a decision-making tool.
7056,4,Experiences and Factors Affecting Usage of an eHealth Tool for Self-Management Among People With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Qualitative Study
7057,0,Self-management strategies are regarded as highly prioritized in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment guidelines. 
7058,0,"However, individual and structural barriers lead to a staggering amount of people with COPD that are not offered support for such strategies, and new approaches are urgently needed to circumvent these barriers. "
7059,0,A promising way of delivering health services such as support for self-management strategies is the use of eHealth tools. 
7060,0,"However, there is a lack of knowledge about the usage of, and factors affecting the use of, eHealth tools over time in people with COPD."
7061,1,"The eHealth tool included information on evidence-based self-management treatment for people with COPD, including texts, pictures, videos as well as interactive components such as a step registration function with automatized feedback. "
7062,1,"In addition to the latter, automated notifications of new content and pedometers were used as triggers to increase usage. "
7063,1,"After having access to the tool for 3 months, 16 individuals (12 women) with COPD were individually interviewed. "
7064,1,"At 12 months' access to the tool, 7 (5 women) of the previous 16 individuals accepted a second individual interview. "
7065,1,Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. 
7066,1,"User frequency was considered in the analysis, and participants were divided into users and nonusers/seldom users depending on the number of logins and minutes of usage per month."
7067,2,"Three main categories, namely, ambiguous impact, basic conditions for usage, and approaching capability emerged from the analysis, which, together with their subcategories, reflect the participants' experiences of using the eHealth tool. "
7068,2,"Nonusers/seldom users (median 1.5 logins and 1.78 minutes spent on the site per month) reported low motivation, a higher need for technical support, a negative view about the disease and self-management, and had problematic health literacy as measured by the Communicative and Critical Health Literacy Scale (median [range] 154 [5-2102]). "
7069,2,"Users (median 10 logins and 43 minutes per month) felt comfortable with information technology (IT) tools, had a positive view on triggers, and had sufficient health literacy (median [range] 5 [5-1400]). "
7070,2,Benefits including behavior changes were mainly expressed after 12 months had passed and mainly among users.
7071,3,"Findings of this study indicate that the level of motivation, comfortability with IT tools, and the level of health literacy seem to affect usage of an eHealth tool over time. "
7072,3,"Besides, regarding behavioral changes, gaining benefits from the eHealth tool seems reserved for the users and specifically after 12 months, thus suggesting that eHealth tools can be suitable media for supporting COPD-specific self-management skills, although not for everyone or at all times. "
7073,3,These novel findings are of importance when designing new eHealth tools as well as when deciding on whether or not an eHealth tool might be appropriate to use if the goal is to support self-management among people with COPD.
7074,4,Investigating the Use of Electronic Well-being Diaries Completed Within a Psychoeducation Program for University Students: Longitudinal Text Analysis Study
7075,0,"Psychoeducation has the potential to support students experiencing distress and help meet the demand for support; however, there is a need to understand how these programs are experienced. "
7076,0,"Web-based diaries are a useful activity for psychoeducation because of their therapeutic benefits, ability to capture naturalistic data relevant to well-being, and appropriateness for text analysis methods."
7077,1,The Science of Happiness course was administered to 154 undergraduate students in a university setting (the United Kingdom). 
7078,1,Diaries were collected from the students for 9 weeks. 
7079,1,Baseline well-being data were collected using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS). 
7080,1,"The percentage of negative and positive emotion words used in diaries (emotional tone) and use of words from five life domains (social, work, money, health, and leisure) were calculated using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015 software. "
7081,1,"Random effects (generalized least squares) regression models were estimated to examine whether time, diary characteristics, demographics, and baseline well-being predict the emotional tone of diaries."
7082,2,"A total of 149 students participated in the diary study, producing 1124 individual diary entries. "
7083,2,"Compliance with the diary task peaked in week 1 (n=1041, 92.62%) and was at its lowest in week 3 (n=807, 71.81%). "
7084,2,"Compared with week 1, diaries were significantly more positive in their emotional tone during week 5 (mean difference 23.90, 95% CI 16.89-30.90) and week 6 (mean difference 26.62, 95% CI 19.35-33.88) when students were tasked with writing about gratitude and their strengths. "
7085,2,"Across weeks, moderate and high baseline SWEMWBS scores were associated with a higher percentage of positive emotion words used in diaries (increases compared with students scoring low in SWEMWBS were 5.03, 95% CI 0.08-9.98 and 7.48, 95% CI 1.84-13.12, respectively). "
7086,2,"At week 1, the diaries of students with the highest levels of baseline well-being (82.92, 95% CI 73.08-92.76) were more emotionally positive on average than the diaries of students with the lowest levels of baseline well-being (59.38, 95% CI 51.02-67.73). "
7087,2,Diaries largely focused on the use of social words. 
7088,2,"The emotional tone of diary entries was positively related to the use of leisure (3.56, 95% CI 2.28-4.85) and social words (0.74, 95% CI 0.21-1.27), and inversely related to the use of health words (-1.96, 95% CI -3.70 to -0.22)."
7089,3,We found evidence for short-term task-specific spikes in the emotional positivity of web-based diary entries and recommend future studies examine the possibility of long-term impacts on the writing and well-being of students. 
7090,3,"With student well-being strategies in mind, universities should value and encourage leisure and social activities."
7091,4,Gender Disparity in the Authorship of Biomedical Research Publications During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Observational Study
7092,0,Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically and persist today. 
7093,0,"For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking. "
7094,0,"However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare, elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. "
7095,0,"Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors of scientific publications."
7096,1,This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. 
7097,1,"We investigated the proportion of male and female researchers who published scientific papers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data from biomedical preprint servers and selected Springer-Nature journals. "
7098,1,We used the ordinary least squares regression model to estimate the expected proportions over time by correcting for temporal trends. 
7099,1,"We also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the results."
7100,2,"A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. "
7101,2,"The acquired data set consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. "
7102,2,"The proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field during the pandemic dropped by 9.1%, on average, across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean y(est)=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35; standard error of the estimate, S-est=0.007; standard error of the observation, sigma(x)=0.004). "
7103,2,"The impact was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female scientists in the first author position dropped by 28% (y(est)=0.39; y=0.28; S-est=0.007; sigma(x)=0.007). "
7104,2,"When looking at the last authors, the proportion of women dropped by 7.9%, on average (y(est)=0.25; y=0.23; S-est=0.005; sigma(x)=0.003), while the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8% (y(est)=0.25; y=0.21; S-est=0.005; sigma(x)=0.007). "
7105,2,"Further, by geocoding authors' affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35% in some cases."
7106,3,Our findings document a decrease in the number of publications by female authors in the biomedical field during the global pandemic. 
7107,3,"This effect was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. "
7108,3,This sudden increase in the gender gap was persistent across the 10 countries with the highest number of researchers. 
7109,3,These results should be used to inform the scientific community of this worrying trend in COVID-19 research and the disproportionate effect that the pandemic has had on female academics.
7110,4,Echo Chamber Effect in Rumor Rebuttal Discussions About COVID-19 in China: Social Media Content and Network Analysis Study
7111,0,The dissemination of rumor rebuttal content on social media is vital for rumor control and disease containment during public health crises. 
7112,0,"Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination networks and users' cognition as well as decision-making and interaction behaviors."
7113,1,"We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. "
7114,1,"Using content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals' attitudes when retweeting or commenting on others' tweets. "
7115,1,"Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. "
7116,1,"Based on the results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive judgments. "
7117,1,"Finally, we examined users' interaction content from three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking and sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber effect."
7118,2,"Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. "
7119,2,"Our results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and sharing, and incivility. "
7120,2,"We found that online users' information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility."
7121,3,"Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on interaction content. "
7122,3,"Based on these findings, we provide several suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal."
7123,4,Predicting Public Uptake of Digital Contact Tracing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results From a Nationwide Survey in Singapore
7124,0,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid increase in the amount of information about the disease and SARS-CoV-2 on the internet. "
7125,0,"If the language used in video messages is not clear or understandable to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people with a high school degree or less, this can cause confusion and result in information gaps among DHH people during a health emergency."
7126,1,This is a cross-sectional survey study on DHH people's perceptions about COVID-19 (N=475). 
7127,1,"Items pertaining to COVID-19 knowledge were administered to US deaf adults from April 17, 2020, to May 1, 2020, via a bilingual American Sign Language/English online survey platform."
7128,2,"The sample consisted of 475 DHH adults aged 18-88 years old, with 74% (n=352) identifying as White and 54% (n=256) as female. "
7129,2,About 88% (n=418) of the sample felt they knew most things or a lot about physical distancing. 
7130,2,This figure dropped to 72% (n=342) for the question about the effectiveness of physical distancing in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and 70% (n=333) for the question about the contagiousness of an infected person without symptoms. 
7131,2,Education and a knowledge of the effectiveness of physical distancing significantly predicted knowledge about the contagiousness of an asymptomatic individual. 
7132,2,"Race, gender, and age did not emerge as significant predictors."
7133,3,This results of this study point to the strong connection between education and coronavirus-related knowledge. 
7134,3,Education-related disparities can be remedied by making information fully accessible and easily understood during emergencies and pandemics.
7135,4,Effects of COVID-19 Emergency Alert Text Messages on Practicing Preventive Behaviors: Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey in South Korea
7136,0,Sending emergency messages via mobile phone text messaging can be a promising communication tool to rapidly disseminate information and promote preventive behavior among the public during epidemic outbreaks. 
7137,0,"The battle to overcome COVID-19 is not yet over; thus, it is essential that the public practices preventive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19."
7138,1,"A cross-sectional web-based survey comprising 990 participants was conducted over 3 days (March 25-27, 2020). "
7139,1,A multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the sociodemographic factors that might influence the behavior of reading emergency alert text messages. 
7140,1,A hierarchical linear regression model estimated the associations between reading emergency alert text messages for each precautionary behavior practiced against COVID-19. 
7141,1,"Additionally, the indirect effects of reading the text messages on each precautionary behavior via psychological factors (ie, perceived risk and response efficacy) were calculated. "
7142,1,All data were weighted according to the 2019 Korea census data.
7143,2,"Overall, 49.2% (487/990) of the participants reported that they always read emergency alert text messages and visited the linked website to obtain more information. "
7144,2,"Factors such as female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% CI 1.28-2.21) and older age (30-39 years: OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.25-3.28; 40-49 years: OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.80-4.47; 50-59 years: OR 3.19, 95% CI 2.01-5.06; 60 years and above: OR 3.12, 95% CI 2.00-4.86 versus 18-29 years) were identified to be associated with a higher frequency of reading the text messages. "
7145,2,"Participants who always read the text messages practiced wearing facial masks (beta=.074, P=.01) more frequently than those who did not. "
7146,2,"In terms of social distancing, participants who reported they always read the text messages avoided crowded places (beta=.078, P=.01) and canceled or postponed social gatherings (beta=.103, P<.001) more frequently than those who did not read the text messages. "
7147,2,"Furthermore, reading text messages directly and indirectly affected practicing precautionary behaviors, as the mediation effect of response efficacy between reading text messages and practicing preventive behaviors was significant."
7148,3,Our findings suggest that emergency alert text messages sent to individuals' mobile phones are timely and effective strategies for encouraging preventive behavior in public. 
7149,3,"Sending emergency alert text messages to provide the public with accurate and reliable information could be positively considered by the health authorities, which might reduce the negative impact of infodemics."
7150,4,Adequacy of Web-Based Activities as a Substitute for In-Person Activities for Older Persons During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Survey Study
7151,0,"Senior centers and other types of clubs provide activities for older adults to address boredom, social isolation, and loneliness. "
7152,0,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of these activities have been cancelled. "
7153,0,A limited range of web-based activities have been offered as alternatives. 
7154,0,"However, the effectiveness of these web-based group activities for older adults has scarcely been researched."
7155,1,"In this telephone survey, we interviewed 105 older adults in Israel who had been offered the opportunity to participate in web-based activities after routine activities closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. "
7156,1,"Of the total sample, 49/105 (46.7%) participated in the activities and 56/105 (53.3%) did not. "
7157,1,"We inquired about the respondents' background characteristics, satisfaction with the activities, and reasons for participation or nonparticipation."
7158,2,The respondents who participated in the web-based activities tended to be highly satisfied with at least some of them. 
7159,2,"They rated the enjoyment derived from the content of the activity as the most important motivator, followed by maintaining a routine and by enjoying the group and the presence of others. "
7160,2,"Over 50% of the participants (28/49, 57%) wished to continue with the exercise programming after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 41% (20/49) wished to continue with the web-based lectures. "
7161,2,Participants were more likely to report partaking in alternative activities than nonparticipants (P=.04). 
7162,2,"The most common reasons cited by nonparticipants were being unaware of the web-based program (24/56, 43%) despite a notification having been sent to the entire sample, lack of interest in the content (18/56, 32%), and technical issues (13/56, 23%), such as not owning or being able to fully use a computer. "
7163,2,"Both participants and nonparticipants were interested in a wide range of topics, with many being very particular about the topics they wished to access. "
7164,2,Approximately half expressed willingness to pay for access; those who were willing to pay tended to have more years of education (P=.03).
7165,3,Our findings suggest a need for web-based activities for countering boredom and feelings of isolation. 
7166,3,"The main factors that influence the use, efficacy, and sustainability of online activities are access, motivational and need-fulfilling factors, and whether the activities are sufficiently tailored to individuals' preferences and abilities. "
7167,3,"Challenges in substituting in-person services are promoting social relationships that are currently not sufficiently incorporated into most web-based programs, accommodating a wider range of topics, and increasing the accessibility of current programs to older adults, especially those who are homebound, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic."
7168,4,Virtual Reality Relaxation for Patients With a Psychiatric Disorder: Crossover Randomized Controlled Trial
7169,0,Virtual reality (VR) relaxation is a promising mental health intervention that may be an effective tool for stress reduction but has hardly been tested in clinical trials with psychiatric patients. 
7170,0,We developed an easy-to-use VR self-management relaxation tool (VRelax) with immersive 360 degrees nature videos and interactive animated elements.
7171,1,"A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 50 patients receiving ambulatory treatment for anxiety, psychotic, depressive, or bipolar disorder. "
7172,1,Participants were randomly assigned to start with VRelax or standard relaxation and used both interventions for 10 days at home. 
7173,1,They completed 8 visual analog scales of momentary negative and positive affective states before and after each session. 
7174,1,Global perceived stress and psychiatric symptoms were measured before and after both intervention periods. 
7175,1,Treatment effects were analyzed with multilevel mixed model regression analyses and 2-way analysis of variance.
7176,2,Both VRelax and standard relaxation exercises led to a statistically significant immediate improvement of all negative and positive affective states. 
7177,2,"Compared to standard relaxation, VRelax resulted in a significantly greater reduction of total negative affective state (change 16.2% versus 21.2%; t(1684)=-2.02, 95% CI -18.70 to -0.28; P=.04). "
7178,2,"Specifically, VRelax had a stronger beneficial effect on momentary anxiety (t(1684)=-3.24, 95% CI -6.86 to -1.69), sadness (t(1684)=-2.32, 95% CI -6.51 to -0.55), and cheerfulness (t(1684)=2.35, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.75). "
7179,2,There were no significant differences between short-term effects of the two treatments on global perceived stress and symptoms.
7180,3,"If the results of this trial are replicated and extended, VRelax may provide a much-needed, effective, easy-to-use self-management relaxation intervention to enhance psychiatric treatments."
7181,4,Development and Implementation of a Decision Support System to Improve Control of Hypertension and Diabetes in a Resource-Constrained Area in Brazil: Mixed Methods Study
7182,0,"The low levels of control of hypertension and diabetes mellitus are a challenge that requires innovative strategies to surpass barriers of low sources, distance, and quality of health care."
7183,1,"This mixed methods study is a substudy of HealthRise Brazil Project, a multinational study designed to implement pilot programs to improve screening, diagnosis, management, and control of hypertension and diabetes among underserved communities. "
7184,1,"Following the identification of gaps in usual care, a team of clinicians established the software functional requirements. "
7185,1,"Recommendations from evidence-based guidelines were reviewed and organized into a decision algorithm, which bases the CDSS reminders and suggestions. "
7186,1,"Following pretesting and expert panel assessment, pilot testing was conducted in a quasi-experimental study, which included 34 primary care units of 10 municipalities in a resource-constrained area in Brazil. "
7187,1,"A Likert-scale questionnaire evaluating perceived feasibility, usability, and utility of the application and professionals' satisfaction was applied after 6 months. "
7188,1,"In the end-line assessment, 2 focus groups with primary care physicians and nurses were performed."
7189,2,A total of 159 reminders and suggestions were created and implemented for the CDSS. 
7190,2,"At the 6-month assessment, there were 1939 patients registered in the application database and 2160 consultations were performed by primary care teams. "
7191,2,"Of the 96 health care professionals who were invited for the usability assessment, 26% (25/96) were physicians, 46% (44/96) were nurses, and 28% (27/96) were other health professionals. "
7192,2,"The questionnaire included 24 items on impressions of feasibility, usability, utility, and satisfaction, and presented global Cronbach a of .93. "
7193,2,"As for feasibility, all professionals agreed (median scores of 4 or 5) that the application could be used in primary care settings and it could be easily incorporated in work routines, but physicians claimed that the application might have caused significant delays in daily routines. "
7194,2,"As for usability, overall evaluation was good and it was claimed that the application was easy to understand and use. "
7195,2,"All professionals agreed that the application was useful (score 4 or 5) to promote prevention, assist treatment, and might improve patient care, and they were overall satisfied with the application (median scores between 4 and 5). "
7196,2,"In the end-line assessment, there were 4211 patients (94.82% [3993/4211] with hypertension and 24.41% [1028/4211] with diabetes) registered in the application's database and 7960 consultations were performed by primary health care teams. "
7197,2,The 17 participants of the focus groups were consistent to affirm they were very satisfied with the CDSS.
7198,3,"The CDSS was applicable in the context of primary health care settings in low-income regions, with good user satisfaction and potential to improve adherence to evidence-based practices."
7199,4,Perceived Electronic Health Record Usability as a Predictor of Task Load and Burnout Among US Physicians: Mediation Analysis
7200,0,Electronic health record (EHR) usability and physician task load both contribute to physician professional burnout. 
7201,0,The association between perceived EHR usability and workload has not previously been studied at a national level. 
7202,0,Better understanding these interactions could give further information as to the drivers of extraneous task load.
7203,1,A secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey of US physicians from all specialties was conducted from October 2017 to March 2018. 
7204,1,"Among the 1250 physicians invited to respond to the subsurvey analyzed here, 848 (67.8%) completed it. "
7205,1,EHR usability was assessed with the System Usability Scale (SUS; range: 0-100). 
7206,1,"Provider task load (PTL) was assessed using the mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, and effort required subscales of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (range: 0-400). "
7207,1,Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory.
7208,2,The mean scores were 46.1 (SD 22.1) for SUS and 262.5 (SD 71.7) for PTL. 
7209,2,"On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, relationship status, medical specialty, practice setting, hours worked per week, and number of nights on call per week, physician-rated EHR usability was associated with PTL, with each 1-point increase in SUS score (indicating more favorable) associated with a 0.57-point decrease in PTL score (P<.001). "
7210,2,"On mediation analysis, higher SUS score was associated with lower PTL score, which was associated with lower odds of burnout."
7211,3,"A strong association was observed between EHR usability and workload among US physicians, with more favorable usability associated with less workload. "
7212,3,"Both outcomes were associated with the odds of burnout, with task load acting as a mediator between EHR usability and burnout. "
7213,3,Improving EHR usability while decreasing task load has the potential to allow practicing physicians more working memory for medical decision making and patient communication.
7214,4,Social Media Insights Into US Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Analysis of Twitter Data
7215,0,The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented mitigation efforts that disrupted the daily lives of millions. 
7216,0,"Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a challenge to the world's mental health and health care systems. "
7217,0,"Considering that traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our population's mental health. "
7218,0,Many people in the United States now use social media platforms such as Twitter to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. 
7219,0,"This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field to understand personal well-being."
7220,1,"We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps. "
7221,1,"First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. "
7222,1,"Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n=354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. "
7223,1,"Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool."
7224,2,LDA topics generated in the early months of the data set corresponded to major COVID-19-specific events. 
7225,2,"However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted toward US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. "
7226,2,"Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. "
7227,2,"Finally, VADER sentiment analysis scores of user timelines were initially high and stable but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March."
7228,3,Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. 
7229,3,"Increased use rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. "
7230,3,"However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media use on mental health, social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term for many individuals. "
7231,3,"Thus, considering the overburdened US mental health care structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts."
7232,4,Effective Control of COVID-19 in South Korea: Cross-Sectional Study of Epidemiological Data
7233,0,"South Korea is one of the few countries that has succeeded in flattening the curve of new COVID-19 cases and avoiding a second outbreak by implementing multiple strategies, ranging from an individual level to the population level."
7234,1,"We designed a cross-sectional study of epidemiological data published by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2020. "
7235,1,"We analyzed detailed epidemiological information of COVID-19 cases, including the number of confirmed cases and resulting deaths."
7236,2,"As of October 1, 2020, a total of 23,889 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 415 deaths were reported in South Korea. "
7237,2,"In this paper, we present data on the epidemiological characteristics and transmission of the disease and discuss how the South Korean government, health care providers, and society responded to the COVID-19 outbreak."
7238,3,Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in South Korea and the government's successful efforts in managing the spread of the disease can provide important insights to other countries dealing with the ongoing pandemic.
7239,4,Improving Provision of Preanesthetic Information Through Use of the Digital Conversational Agent MyAnesth: Prospective Observational Trial
7240,0,"Due to time limitations, the preanesthetic consultation (PAC) is not the best time for patients to integrate information specific to their perioperative care pathway."
7241,1,"We conducted a prospective, monocentric, comparative study using a before-and-after design. "
7242,1,"In phase 1, a 9-item self-reported anesthesia knowledge test (Delphi method) was administered to patients before and after their PAC (control group: PAC group). "
7243,1,"In phase 2, the study was repeated immediately after the implementation of a digital conversational agent, MyAnesth (@+PAC group). "
7244,1,Patients' satisfaction and their representations for anesthesia were also assessed using a Likert scale and the Abric method of hierarchized evocation.
7245,2,"A total of 600 tests were distributed; 205 patients and 98 patients were included in the PAC group and @+PAC group, respectively. "
7246,2,"Demographic characteristics and mean scores on the 9-point preinformation test (PAC group: 4.2 points, 95% CI 3.9-4.4; @+PAC: 4.3 points, 95% CI 4-4.7; P=.37) were similar in the two groups. "
7247,2,"The mean score after receiving information was better in the @+PAC group than in the PAC group (6.1 points, 95% CI 5.8-6.4 points versus 5.2 points, 95% CI 5.0-5.4 points, respectively; P<.001), with an added value of 0.7 points (95% CI 0.3-1.1; P<.001). "
7248,2,"Among the respondents in the @+PAC group, 82% found the information to be clear and appropriate, and 74% found it easily accessible. "
7249,2,"Before receiving information, the central core of patients' representations for anesthesia was focused on the fear of being put to sleep and thereafter on caregiver skills and comfort."
7250,3,The implementation of our digital conversational agent in addition to the PAC improved patients' knowledge about their perioperative care pathway. 
7251,3,"This innovative audiovisual support seemed clear, adapted, easily accessible, and reassuring. "
7252,3,Future studies should focus on adapting both the content and delivery of a digital conversational agent for the PAC in order to maximize its benefit to patients.
7253,4,A Mobile- and Web-Based Health Intervention Program for Diabetes and Prediabetes Self-Management (BetaMe/Melon): Process Evaluation Following a Randomized Controlled Trial
7254,0,Technology-assisted self-management programs are increasingly recommended to patients with long-term conditions such as diabetes. 
7255,0,"However, there are a number of personal and external factors that affect patients' abilities to engage with and effectively utilize such programs. "
7256,0,"A randomized controlled trial of a multi-modal online program for diabetes self-management (BetaMe/Melon) was conducted in a primary care setting, and a process evaluation was completed at the end of the study period."
7257,1,"Process evaluation data were collected for intervention arm participants from 3 sources: (1) the mobile/web platform (to identify key usage patterns over the 16-week core program), (2) an online questionnaire completed during the final study assessment, and (3) interviews conducted with a subset of participants following the study period. "
7258,1,"Participants were classified as ""actively engaged"" if any usage data was recorded for the participant (in any week), and patterns were reported by age, gender, ethnicity, and diabetes/prediabetes status. "
7259,1,The online questionnaire asked participants about the usefulness of the program and whether they would recommend BetaMe/Melon to others according to a 5-point Likert Scale. 
7260,1,"Of 23 invited participants, 18 participated in a digitally recorded, semistructured telephone interview. "
7261,1,Interview data were thematically analyzed.
7262,2,"Out of the 215 participants, 198 (92%) received an initial health coaching session, and 160 (74%) were actively engaged with the program at some point during the 16-week core program. "
7263,2,"Engagement varied by demographic, with women, younger participants, and ethnic majority populations having higher rates of engagement. "
7264,2,Usage steadily declined from 50% at Week 0 to 23% at Week 15. 
7265,2,"Participants ranked component usefulness as education resources (63.7%), health coaches (59.2%), goal tracking (48.8%), and online peer support (42.1%). "
7266,2,"Although 53% agreed that the program was easy to use, 64% would recommend the program to others. "
7267,2,"Interview participants found BetaMe/Melon useful overall, with most identifying beneficial outcomes such as increased knowledge, behavioral changes, and weight loss. "
7268,2,"Barriers to engagement were program functionality, internet connectivity, incomplete delivery of all program components, and participant motivation. "
7269,2,Participants suggested a range of improvements to the BetaMe/Melon program.
7270,3,"The program was generally well received by participants; active engagement was initially high, although it declined steadily Maintaining participant engagement over time, individualizing programs, and addressing technical barriers are important to maximize potential health benefits from online diabetes self-management programs."
7271,4,Adoption of Digital Technologies in Health Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review of Early Scientific Literature
7272,0,The COVID-19 pandemic is favoring digital transitions in many industries and in society as a whole. 
7273,0,Health care organizations have responded to the first phase of the pandemic by rapidly adopting digital solutions and advanced technology tools.
7274,1,"We conducted a systematic review of early COVID-19-related literature (from January 1 to April 30, 2020) by searching MEDLINE and medRxiv with appropriate terms to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to the pandemic. "
7275,1,"We extracted study characteristics such as the paper title, journal, and publication date, and we categorized the retrieved papers by the type of technology and patient needs addressed. "
7276,1,We built a scoring rubric by cross-classifying the patient needs with the type of technology. 
7277,1,"We also extracted information and classified each technology reported by the selected articles according to health care system target, grade of innovation, and scalability to other geographical areas."
7278,2,"The search identified 269 articles, of which 124 full-text articles were assessed and included in the review after screening. "
7279,2,"Most of the selected articles addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention. "
7280,2,We report that most of these digital solutions and innovative technologies have been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. 
7281,2,"In particular, within the reviewed articles, we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. "
7282,2,"Digital technologies are also useful for prevention and surveillance measures, such as contact-tracing apps and monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. "
7283,2,Fewer scientific contributions address the use of digital technologies for lifestyle empowerment or patient engagement.
7284,3,"In the field of diagnosis, digital solutions that integrate with traditional methods, such as AI-based diagnostic algorithms based both on imaging and clinical data, appear to be promising. "
7285,3,"For surveillance, digital apps have already proven their effectiveness; however, problems related to privacy and usability remain. "
7286,3,"For other patient needs, several solutions have been proposed, such as telemedicine or telehealth tools. "
7287,3,"These tools have long been available, but this historical moment may actually be favoring their definitive large-scale adoption. "
7288,3,"It is worth taking advantage of the impetus provided by the crisis; it is also important to keep track of the digital solutions currently being proposed to implement best practices and models of care in future and to adopt at least some of the solutions proposed in the scientific literature, especially in national health systems, which have proved to be particularly resistant to the digital transition in recent years."
7289,4,"Social Media Use, eHealth Literacy, Disease Knowledge, and Preventive Behaviors in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Study on Chinese Netizens"
7290,0,"Since its outbreak in January 2020, COVID-19 has quickly spread worldwide and has become a global pandemic. "
7291,0,"Social media platforms have been recognized as important tools for health-promoting practices in public health, and the use of social media is widespread among the public. "
7292,0,"However, little is known about the effects of social media use on health promotion during a pandemic such as COVID-19."
7293,1,"A national web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted by a proportionate probability sampling among 802 Chinese internet users (""netizens"") in February 2020. "
7294,1,"Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and hierarchical multiple regressions were employed to examine and explore the relationships among all the variables."
7295,2,"Almost half the 802 study participants were male (416, 51.9%), and the average age of the participants was 32.65 years. "
7296,2,"Most of the 802 participants had high education levels (624, 77.7%), had high income ><yen>5000 (US $736.29) (525, 65.3%), were married (496, 61.8%), and were in good health (486, 60.6%). "
7297,2,"The average time of social media use was approximately 2 to 3 hours per day (mean 2.34 hours, SD 1.11), and the most frequently used media types were public social media (mean score 4.49/5, SD 0.78) and aggregated social media (mean score 4.07/5, SD 1.07). "
7298,2,"Social media use frequency (beta=.20, P<.001) rather than time significantly predicted preventive behaviors for COVID-19. "
7299,2,"Respondents were also equipped with high levels of disease knowledge (mean score 8.15/10, SD 1.43) and eHealth literacy (mean score 3.79/5, SD 0.59). "
7300,2,"Disease knowledge (beta=.11, P=.001) and eHealth literacy (beta=.27, P<.001) were also significant predictors of preventive behaviors. "
7301,2,"Furthermore, eHealth literacy (P=.038) and disease knowledge (P=.03) positively moderated the relationship between social media use frequency and preventive behaviors, while eHealth literacy (beta=.07) affected this relationship positively and disease knowledge (beta=-.07) affected it negatively. "
7302,2,Different social media types differed in predicting an individual's preventive behaviors for COVID-19. 
7303,2,"Aggregated social media (beta=.22, P<.001) was the best predictor, followed by public social media (beta=.14, P<.001) and professional social media (beta=.11, P=.002). "
7304,2,"However, official social media (beta=.02, P=.597) was an insignificant predictor."
7305,3,Social media is an effective tool to promote behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among the public. 
7306,3,Health literacy is essential for promotion of individual health and influences the extent to which the public engages in preventive behaviors during a pandemic. 
7307,3,Our results not only enrich the theoretical paradigm of public health management and health communication but also have practical implications in pandemic control for China and other countries.
7308,4,Evaluation of a Heart Failure Telemonitoring Program Through a Microsimulation Model: Cost-Utility Analysis
7309,0,"Heart failure (HF) is a major public health issue in Canada that is associated with high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates and high financial and social burdens. "
7310,0,Telemonitoring (TM) has been shown to improve all-cause mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with HF. 
7311,0,The Medly program is a TM intervention integrated as standard of care at a large Canadian academic hospital for ambulatory patients with HF that has been found to improve patient outcomes. 
7312,0,"However, the cost-effectiveness of the Medly program is yet to be determined."
7313,1,"Using a microsimulation model, individual patient data were simulated over a 25-year time horizon to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between the Medly program and standard care for patients with HF treated in the ambulatory care setting. "
7314,1,"Data were sourced from a Medly Program Evaluation study and literature to inform model parameters, such as Medly's effectiveness in reducing mortality and hospitalizations, health care and intervention costs, and model transition probabilities. "
7315,1,Scenario analyses were conducted in relation to HF severity and TM deployment models. 
7316,1,One-way deterministic effectiveness analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to explore the impact on the results of uncertainty in model parameters.
7317,2,"The Medly program was associated with an average total cost of Can $102,508 (US $77,626) per patient and total QALYs of 5.51 per patient compared with the average cost of Can $97,497 (US $73,831) and QALYs of 4.95 per patient in the Standard Care Group. "
7318,2,"This led to an incremental cost of Can $5011 (US $3794) and incremental QALY of 0.566, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Can $8850 (US $6701)/QALY. "
7319,2,Cost-effectiveness improved in relation to patients with advanced HF and with deployment models in which patients used their own equipment. 
7320,2,"Baseline and alternative scenarios consistently showed probabilities of cost-effectiveness greater than 85% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of Can $50,000 (US $37,718). "
7321,2,"Although the results showed some sensitivity to assumptions about effectiveness parameters, the intervention was found to remain cost-effective."
7322,3,The Medly program for patients with HF is cost-effective compared with standard care using commonly reported willingness-to-pay thresholds. 
7323,3,"This study provides evidence for decision makers on the use of TM for HF, supports the use of a nurse-led model of TM that embeds clinically validated algorithms, and informs the use of economic modeling for future evaluations of early-stage health informatics technology."
7324,4,Research Participants Perspectives on Using an Electronic Portal for Engagement and Data Collection: Focus Group Results From a Large Epidemiologic Cohort
7325,0,"Epidemiologic cohort studies have begun to leverage electronic research participant portals to facilitate data collection, integrate wearable technologies, lower costs, and engage participants. "
7326,0,"However, little is known about the acceptability of portal use by research participants."
7327,1,"CPS-3 participants were stratified based on sex, race and ethnicity, age, and cancer status, and randomly invited to participate. "
7328,1,Focus groups used an exploratory case design with semistructured guides to prompt discussion. 
7329,1,"Using a constant comparison technique, transcripts were assigned codes to identify themes."
7330,2,"Participants (31/59, 52% women; 52/59, 88% White/non-Latinx) were favorably disposed toward using a research participant portal to take surveys, communicate with the study staff, and upload data. "
7331,2,Most participants indicated that a portal would be beneficial and convenient but expressed concerns over data safety. 
7332,2,Participants stressed the importance of an easy-to-use and trustworthy portal that is compatible with mobile devices.
7333,3,"In addition to being beneficial to researchers, portals may also benefit participants as long as the portals are secure and simple. "
7334,3,Participants believe that portals can provide convenient ways to report data and remain connected to the study.
7335,4,"Promoting Safe Injection Practices, Substance Use Reduction, Hepatitis C Testing, and Overdose Prevention Among Syringe Service Program Clients Using a Computer-Tailored Intervention: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial"
7336,0,"Syringe service programs (SSPs) are safe, highly effective programs for promoting health among people who inject drugs. "
7337,0,"However, resource limitations prevent the delivery of a full package of prevention services to many clients in need. "
7338,0,Computer-tailored interventions may represent a promising approach for providing prevention information to people who inject drugs in resource-constrained settings.
7339,1,"Using a social network-based recruitment strategy, we recruited clients of an established SSP in Wisconsin and peers from their social networks. "
7340,1,Participants completed a computerized baseline survey and were then randomly assigned to receive the Hep-Net intervention. 
7341,1,"Components of the intervention included an overall risk synthesis, participants' selection of a behavioral goal, and an individualized risk reduction exercise. "
7342,1,Individuals were followed up 3 months later to assess their behavior change. 
7343,1,"The effect of Hep-Net on receiving an HCV screening test, undergoing Narcan training, reducing the frequency of drug use, and sharing drug equipment was assessed. "
7344,1,The individual's readiness to change each behavior was also examined.
7345,2,"From 2014 to 2015, a total of 235 people who injected drugs enrolled into the Hep-Net study. "
7346,2,"Of these, 64.3% (151/235) completed the follow-up survey 3-6 months postenrollment. "
7347,2,"Compared with the control group, individuals who received the Hep-Net intervention were more likely to undergo HCV testing (odds ratio [OR] 2.23, 95% CI 1.05-4.74; P=.04) and receive Narcan training (OR 2.25, 95% CI 0.83-6.06; P=.11), and they shared drug equipment less frequently (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.55-0.65; P<.001). "
7348,2,"Similarly, individuals who received the intervention were more likely to advance in their stage of readiness to change these 3 behaviors. "
7349,2,"However, intervention participants did not appear to reduce the frequency of drug use or increase their readiness to reduce drug use more than control participants, despite the fact that the majority of the intervention participants selected this as the primary goal to focus on after participation in the baseline survey."
7350,3,"Implementing computer-based risk reduction interventions in SSPs may reduce harms associated with the sharing of injection equipment and prevent overdose deaths; however, brief computerized interventions may not be robust enough to overcome the challenges associated with reducing and ceasing drug use when implemented in settings centered on the delivery of prevention services."
7351,4,Accelerating Innovation in Health Care: Insights From a Qualitative Inquiry Into United Kingdom and United States Innovation Centers
7352,0,Digital health innovations are being prioritized on international policy agendas in the hope that they will help to address the existing health system challenges.
7353,1,"We conducted qualitative case studies consisting of semistructured, audio-recorded interviews with decision makers and center staff in 6 innovation centers. "
7354,1,"We also conducted nonparticipant observations of meetings and center tours, where we took field notes. "
7355,1,Qualitative data were analyzed initially within and then across cases facilitated by QSR International's NVivo software.
7356,2,"The centers had different institutional arrangements, including university-associated institutes or innovation laboratories, business accelerators or incubators, and academic health science partnership models. "
7357,2,"We conducted interviews with 34 individuals, 1 group interview with 3 participants, and observations of 4 meetings. "
7358,2,"Although the centers differed significantly in relation to their mission, structure, and governance, we observed key common characteristics. "
7359,2,"These included high-level leadership support and incentives to engage in innovation activities, a clear mission to address identified gaps within their respective organizational and health system settings, physical spaces that facilitated networking through open-door policies, flat managerial structures characterized by new organizational roles for which boundary spanning was key, and a wider innovation ecosystem that was strategically and proactively engaged with the center facilitating external partnerships."
7360,3,"Although innovation in health care settings is unpredictable, we offer insights that may help those establishing innovation centers. "
7361,3,"The key in this respect is the ability to support different kinds of innovations at different stages through adequate support structures, including the development of new career pathways."
7362,4,Excess Patient Visits for Cough and Pulmonary Disease at a Large US Health System in the Months Prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Time-Series Analysis
7363,0,Accurately assessing the regional activity of diseases such as COVID-19 is important in guiding public health interventions. 
7364,0,Leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor outpatient clinical encounters may lead to the identification of emerging outbreaks.
7365,1,"A retrospective observational cohort was identified from a large US health system with 3 hospitals, over 180 clinics, and 2.5 million patient encounters annually. "
7366,1,"Data from patient encounters from July 1, 2014, to February 29, 2020, were included. "
7367,1,Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time-series models were used to evaluate if the observed winter 2019/2020 rates were higher than the forecast 95% prediction intervals. 
7368,1,The estimated excess number of visits and hospitalizations in winter 2019/2020 were calculated compared to previous seasons.
7369,2,"The percentage of patients presenting with an EHR reason for visit containing the word ""cough"" to clinics exceeded the 95% prediction interval the week of December 22, 2019, and was consistently above the 95% prediction interval all 10 weeks through the end of February 2020. "
7370,2,"Similar trends were noted for emergency department visits and hospitalizations starting December 22, 2019, where observed data exceeded the 95% prediction interval in 6 and 7 of the 10 weeks, respectively. "
7371,2,"The estimated excess over the 3-month 2019/2020 winter season, obtained by either subtracting the maximum or subtracting the average of the five previous seasons from the current season, was 1.6 or 2.0 excess visits for cough per 1000 outpatient visits, 11.0 or 19.2 excess visits for cough per 1000 emergency department visits, and 21.4 or 39.1 excess visits per 1000 hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure, respectively. "
7372,2,"The total numbers of excess cases above the 95% predicted forecast interval were 168 cases in the outpatient clinics, 56 cases for the emergency department, and 18 hospitalized with acute respiratory failure."
7373,3,A significantly higher number of patients with respiratory complaints and diseases starting in late December 2019 and continuing through February 2020 suggests community spread of SARS-CoV-2 prior to established clinical awareness and testing capabilities. 
7374,3,This provides a case example of how health system analytics combined with EHR data can provide powerful and agile tools for identifying when future trends in patient populations are outside of the expected ranges.
7375,4,Intention to use Medical Apps Among Older Adults in the Netherlands: Cross-Sectional Study
7376,0,The increasing health service demand driven by the aging of the global population calls for the development of modes of health service delivery that are less human resource-intensive. 
7377,0,Electronic health (eHealth) and medical apps are expected to play an important role in this development. 
7378,0,"Although evidence shows mobile medical apps might be effective in improving the care, self-management, self-efficacy, health-related behavior, and medication adherence of older adults, little is known about older adults' intention to use these technologies when needed, or the factors influencing this intention."
7379,1,Data was collected using questionnaires. 
7380,1,The factors selected from the literature have been validated using Cronbach alpha and tested for significance using logistic regressions.
7381,2,Almost half (49.7%) of the included older adults reported no intention to use medical apps. 
7382,2,"Adjusted logistic regression analysis per factor showed that the factors Attitude toward use (odds ratio [OR] 8.50), Perceived usefulness (OR 5.25), Perceived ease of use (OR 4.22), Service availability (OR 3.46), Sense of control (OR 3.40), Self-perceived effectiveness (OR 2.69), Facilities (OR 2.45), Personal innovativeness (OR 2.08), Social relationships (OR 1.79), Subjective norm (OR 1.48), and Feelings of anxiety (OR 0.62) significantly influenced the intention to use mobile medical apps among older adults, whereas the factor Finance (OR 0.98) did not. "
7383,2,"When considered together, a controlled multivariate logistic regression yielded high explained variances of 0.542 (Cox-Snell R-2) and 0.728 (Nagelkerke R-2)."
7384,3,The high odds ratios and explained variance indicate that the factors associated with the intention to use medical apps are largely understood and the most important factors have been identified. 
7385,3,"To advance the evidence base, experimental controlled research should investigate the causality between the factors, intention to use, and actual use. "
7386,3,"For this purpose, our evidence suggests that policies designed to improve Attitude toward use appear most effective, followed by policies addressing Perceived usefulness, Perceived ease of use, Service availability, and Sense of control."
7387,4,"Compensatory Social Networking Site Use, Family Support, and Depression Among College Freshman: Three-Wave Panel Study"
7388,0,"Freshmen were found to use social networking sites (SNS) as a useful medium to effectively adjust to college life, which hints at a tendency to resort to SNS for social compensation. "
7389,0,"However, the compensatory use of SNS is usually problematic."
7390,1,A 3-wave panel sample of freshmen (N=1137) is used to examine the moderated mediation model.
7391,2,"We found that introversion at Wave 1 positively predicted compensatory use of SNS at Wave 2 and subsequently increased depression at Wave 3 (unstandardized B=0.07, SE 0.02, P<.001, 95% CI 0.04-0.10; unstandardized B=0.09, SE 0.01, P<.001, 95% CI 0.06-0.12). "
7392,2,"The moderated mediation model further examined the buffering role of perceived family support within the link between introversion and compensatory SNS use (index=0.0031, SE 0.0015, 95% CI 0.0003-0.0062). "
7393,2,"Unexpectedly, we found that family support in Wave 1 decreased compensatory SNS use for less introverted freshmen in Wave 2 and further decreased depression in Wave 3."
7394,3,"Unexpectedly, our findings uncover an enhancing effect, rather than a buffering effect, of family support by embedding its effect within the relationship between introversion and compensatory SNS use. "
7395,3,Appreciating the differences in the casual pathways for freshmen with different levels of introversion clarifies how SNS affect young adults' lives.
7396,4,Effectiveness of Mobile Health Interventions Promoting Physical Activity and Lifestyle Interventions to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk Among Individuals With Metabolic Syndrome: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
7397,0,"Physical activity and lifestyle interventions, such as a healthy diet, have been proven to be effective approaches to manage metabolic syndrome. "
7398,0,"However, these interventions require great commitment from patients and clinicians owing to their economic costs, time consumption, and lack of immediate results."
7399,1,"PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SPORTdiscus databases were searched for experimental studies evaluating cardiometabolic risk indicators among individuals with metabolic syndrome who were included in technology-assisted physical activity and lifestyle interventions. "
7400,1,"Effect sizes, pooled mean changes, and their respective 95% CIs were calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird method. "
7401,1,"Outcomes included the following clinical and biochemical parameters: body composition (waist circumference [WC] and BMI), blood pressure (systolic blood pressure [SBP] and diastolic blood pressure [DBP]), glucose tolerance (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] and glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA(1c)]), and lipid profile (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], and triglycerides)."
7402,2,A total of nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. 
7403,2,"Owing to the scarcity of studies, only pooled mean pre-post changes in the intervention groups were estimated. "
7404,2,"Significant mean changes were observed for BMI (-1.70 kg/m2, 95% CI -3.20 to -0.20; effect size: -0.46; P=.03), WC (-5.77 cm, 95% CI -9.76 to -1.77; effect size: -0.54; P=.005), SBP (-7.33 mmHg, 95% CI -13.25 to -1.42; effect size: -0.43; P=.02), DBP (-3.90 mmHg, 95% CI -7.70 to -0.11; effect size: -0.44; P=.04), FPG (-3.65 mg/dL, 95% CI -4.79 to -2.51; effect size: -0.39; P<.001), and HDL-C (4.19 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.43-5.95; effect size: 0.23; P<.001)."
7405,3,"Overall, mobile-based health interventions aimed at promoting physical activity and healthy lifestyle changes had a strong positive effect on cardiometabolic risk indicators among individuals with metabolic syndrome. "
7406,3,"Nevertheless, further research is required to compare this approach with usual care in order to support the incorporation of these technologies in health systems."
7407,4,Causal Effect of Honorary Titles on Physicians Service Volumes in Online Health Communities: Retrospective Study
7408,0,An OHC online health community (OHC) is an interactive platform for virtual communication between patients and physicians. 
7409,0,"Patients can typically search, seek, and share their experience and rate physicians, who may be involved in giving advice. "
7410,0,"Some OHC providers provide incentives in form of honorary titles to encourage the web-based involvement of physicians, but it is unclear whether the award of honorary titles has an impact on their consultation volume in an OHC."
7411,1,"We acquired the targeted samples based on treatment, namely, physicians with an honorary title or not and outcomes measured before and after the award of the 2 subgroups. "
7412,1,A regression discontinuity design was applied to investigate the impact of the honorary titles incentive as a treatment in an OHC. 
7413,1,There was a sharply discontinuous effect of treatment on physicians' online health service performance. 
7414,1,The experimental data set consisted of 346 physicians in the treatment group (with honorary titles). 
7415,1,"Applying the propensity score matching method, the same size of physicians (n=346) was matched and selected as the control group."
7416,2,A sharp discontinuity was found at the time of the physician receiving the honorary title. 
7417,2,The results showed that the parametric estimates of the coefficient were significantly positively (P<.001) associated with monthly home page views. 
7418,2,The jump in the monthly volumes of home page views was much sharper than that of the monthly consultations.
7419,3,The changes in the volumes of monthly consultations and home page views reflect the differential treatment effect of honorary titles on physicians' service volumes. 
7420,3,The effect of the incentive policy with honorary titles is objectively estimated from both the perspective of online and offline medical services in an OHC. 
7421,3,"Being named with honorary titles significantly multiplied monthly home page views, yet it did not significantly impact monthly consultations. "
7422,3,This may be because consultation capacity is limited by the physician's schedule for consultations.
7423,4,"Detection of Suicidal Ideation on Social Media: Multimodal, Relational, and Behavioral Analysis"
7424,0,Suicide risk assessment usually involves an interaction between doctors and patients. 
7425,0,"However, a significant number of people with mental disorders receive no treatment for their condition due to the limited access to mental health care facilities; the reduced availability of clinicians; the lack of awareness; and stigma, neglect, and discrimination surrounding mental disorders. "
7426,0,"In contrast, internet access and social media usage have increased significantly, providing experts and patients with a means of communication that may contribute to the development of methods to detect mental health issues among social media users."
7427,1,"We characterized users based on their writings, posting patterns, relations with other users, and images posted. "
7428,1,We also evaluated statistical and deep learning approaches to handle multimodal data for the detection of users with signs of suicidal ideation (suicidal ideation risk group). 
7429,1,Our methods were evaluated over a dataset of 252 users annotated by clinicians. 
7430,1,"To evaluate the performance of our models, we distinguished 2 control groups: users who make use of suicide-related vocabulary (focused control group) and generic random users (generic control group)."
7431,2,We identified significant statistical differences between the textual and behavioral attributes of each of the control groups compared with the suicidal ideation risk group. 
7432,2,"At a 95% CI, when comparing the suicidal ideation risk group and the focused control group, the number of friends (P=.04) and median tweet length (P=.04) were significantly different. "
7433,2,The median number of friends for a focused control user (median 578.5) was higher than that for a user at risk (median 372.0). 
7434,2,"Similarly, the median tweet length was higher for focused control users, with 16 words against 13 words of suicidal ideation risk users. "
7435,2,"Our findings also show that the combination of textual, visual, relational, and behavioral data outperforms the accuracy of using each modality separately. "
7436,2,"We defined text-based baseline models based on bag of words and word embeddings, which were outperformed by our models, obtaining an increase in accuracy of up to 8% when distinguishing users at risk from both types of control users."
7437,3,"The types of attributes analyzed are significant for detecting users at risk, and their combination outperforms the results provided by generic, exclusively text-based baseline models. "
7438,3,"After evaluating the contribution of image-based predictive models, we believe that our results can be improved by enhancing the models based on textual and relational features. "
7439,3,These methods can be extended and applied to different use cases related to other mental disorders.
7440,4,Mapping of Health Literacy and Social Panic Via Web Search Data During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency: Infodemiological Study
7441,0,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a type of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus that was discovered in 2019. 
7442,0,"As of May 6, 2020, 84,407 cases and 4643 deaths have been confirmed in China The Chinese population has expressed great concern since the COVID-19 outbreak. "
7443,0,"Meanwhile, an average of 1 billion people per day are using the Baidu search engine to find COVID-19-related health information."
7444,1,We conducted an infodemiological study to analyze web search data volumes related to COVID-19. 
7445,1,"Using Baidu Index data, we assessed the search frequencies of specific search terms in Baidu to describe the impact of COVID-19 on public health, psychology, behaviors, lifestyles, and social policies (from February 11, 2020, to March 17, 2020)."
7446,2,The search frequency related to COVID-19 has increased significantly since February 11th. 
7447,2,"Our heat maps demonstrate that citizens in Wuhan, Hubei Province, express more concern about COVID-19 than citizens from other cities since the outbreak first occurred in Wuhan. "
7448,2,"Wuhan citizens frequently searched for content related to ""medical help,"" ""protective materials,"" and ""pandemic progress."" Web searches for ""return to work"" and ""go back to school"" have increased eight-fold compared to the previous month. "
7449,2,"Searches for content related to ""closed community and remote office"" have continued to rise, and searches for ""remote office demand"" have risen by 663% from the previous quarter. "
7450,2,"Employees who have returned to work have mainly engaged in the following web searches: ""return to work and prevention measures,"" ""return to work guarantee policy,"" and ""time to return to work."" Provinces with large, educated populations (eg, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong) have been focusing on ""online education"" whereas medium-sized cities have been paying more attention to ""online medical care."""
7451,3,"Our findings suggest that web search data may reflect changes in health literacy, social panic, and prevention and control policies in response to COVID-19."
7452,4,Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage of Deidentified Records Within a Public Health Surveillance System: Evaluation Study
7453,0,The Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS) was established to monitor national testing and test outcomes for blood-borne viruses (BBVs) and sexually transmissible infections (STIs) in key populations. 
7454,0,"ACCESS extracts deidentified data from sentinel health services that include general practice, sexual health, and infectious disease clinics, as well as public and private laboratories that conduct a large volume of BBV/STI testing. "
7455,0,"An important attribute of ACCESS is the ability to accurately link individual-level records within and between the participating sites, as this enables the system to produce reliable epidemiological measures."
7456,1,"Although ACCESS data are deidentified, we created two gold-standard datasets where the true match status could be confirmed in order to compare against record linkage results arising from different approaches of the GRHANITE Linkage Tool. "
7457,1,"We reported sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values where possible and estimated specificity by comparing a history of HIV and hepatitis C antibody results for linked EMRs."
7458,2,"Sensitivity ranged from 96% to 100%, and specificity was 100% when applying the GRHANITE Linkage Tool to a small gold-standard dataset of 3700 clinical medical records. "
7459,2,"Medical records in this dataset contained a very high level of data completeness by having the name, date of birth, post code, and Medicare number available for use in record linkage. "
7460,2,"In a larger gold-standard dataset containing 86,538 medical records across clinics and pathology services, with a lower level of data completeness, sensitivity ranged from 94% to 95% and estimated specificity ranged from 91% to 99% in 4 of the 6 different record linkage approaches."
7461,3,This study's findings suggest that the GRHANITE Linkage Tool can be used to link deidentified patient records accurately and can be confidently used for public health surveillance in systems such as ACCESS.
7462,4,Simulator Pre-Screening of Underprepared Drivers Prior to Licensing On-Road Examination: Clustering of Virtual Driving Test Time Series Data
7463,0,A large Midwestern state commissioned a virtual driving test (VDT) to assess driving skills preparedness before the on-road examination (ORE). 
7464,0,"Since July 2017, a pilot deployment of the VDT in state licensing centers (VDT pilot) has collected both VDT and ORE data from new license applicants with the aim of creating a scoring algorithm that could predict those who were underprepared."
7465,1,"We analyzed an initial dataset that comprised 4308 drivers who completed both the VDT and the ORE, in which 1096 (25.4%) drivers went on to fail the ORE. "
7466,1,We studied 2 different approaches to constructing feature sets to use as input to ML algorithms: the standard method of reducing the time series data to a set of manually defined variables that summarize driving behavior and a novel approach using time series clustering. 
7467,1,We then fed these representations into different ML algorithms to compare their ability to predict a driver's ORE outcome (pass/fail).
7468,2,The new method using time series clustering performed similarly compared with the standard method in terms of overall accuracy for predicting pass or fail outcome (76.1% vs 76.2%) and area under the curve (0.656 vs 0.682). 
7469,2,"However, the time series clustering slightly outperformed the standard method in differentially predicting failure on the ORE. "
7470,2,"The novel clustering method yielded a risk ratio for failure of 3.07 (95% CI 2.75-3.43), whereas the standard variables method yielded a risk ratio for failure of 2.68 (95% CI 2.41-2.99). "
7471,2,"In addition, the time series clustering method with logistic regression produced the lowest ratio of false alarms (those who were predicted to fail but went on to pass the ORE; 27.2%)."
7472,3,"Our results provide initial evidence that the clustering method is useful for feature construction in classification tasks involving time series data when resources are limited to create multiple, domain-relevant variables."
7473,4,Continuous Monitoring of Vital Signs in the General Ward Using Wearable Devices: Randomized Controlled Trial
7474,0,"Wearable devices can be used for continuous patient monitoring in the general ward, increasing patient safety. "
7475,0,Little is known about the experiences and expectations of patients and health care professionals regarding continuous monitoring with these devices.
7476,1,"In this randomized controlled trial, 90 patients admitted to the internal medicine and surgical wards of a university hospital in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to continuous vital sign monitoring using VM or HP and a control group. "
7477,1,Users' experiences and expectations were addressed using semistructured interviews. 
7478,1,"Nurses, physician assistants, and medical doctors were also interviewed. "
7479,1,Interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. 
7480,1,Psychological distress was assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. 
7481,1,The System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of both devices.
7482,2,"A total of 60 patients, 20 nurses, 3 physician assistants, and 6 medical doctors were interviewed. "
7483,2,We identified 47 positive and 30 negative effects and 19 facilitators and 36 barriers for the use of VM and HP. 
7484,2,"Frequently mentioned topics included earlier identification of clinical deterioration, increased feelings of safety, and VM lines and electrodes. "
7485,2,No differences related to psychological distress and usability were found between randomization groups or devices.
7486,3,"Both devices were well received by most patients and health care professionals, and the majority of them encouraged the idea of monitoring vital signs continuously in the general ward. "
7487,3,"This comprehensive overview of barriers and facilitators of using wireless devices may serve as a guide for future researchers, developers, and health care institutions that consider implementing continuous monitoring in the ward."
7488,4,Reliability of Smartphone for Diffusion-Weighted Imaging-Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Scores in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients: Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study
7489,0,High-quality neuroimages can be viewed using a medical app installed on a smartphone. 
7490,0,"Although interdevice agreement between smartphone and desktop PC monitor was found to be favorable for evaluating computed tomography images, there are no interdevice agreement data for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)."
7491,1,The ischemic change in the DWI of consecutive patients with acute stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory was graded by 2 vascular neurologists using the Join smartphone app and a desktop PC monitor. 
7492,1,The vascular neurologists were blinded to all patient information. 
7493,1,Each image was categorized as either Diffusion-Weighted Imaging-Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Scores (DWI-ASPECTS) >= 7 or DWI-ASPECTS <7 according to the Japanese Society for Neuroendovascular Therapy. 
7494,1,We analyzed interdevice agreement and interrater agreement with respect to DWI-ASPECTS. 
7495,1,Elapsed interpretation time was compared between DWI-ASPECTS evaluated by the Join smartphone app and a desktop PC monitor.
7496,2,We analyzed the images of 111 patients (66% male; median age=69 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission=4). 
7497,2,"Interdevice agreement regarding DWI-ASPECTS between the smartphone and the desktop PC monitor was favorable (vascular neurologist 1: kappa=0.777, P<.001, vascular neurologist 2: kappa=0.787, P<.001). "
7498,2,"Interrater agreement was also satisfactory for the smartphone (kappa=0.710, P<.001) and the desktop PC monitor (kappa=0.663, P<.001). "
7499,2,Median elapsed interpretation time was similar between the smartphone and the desktop PC monitor (vascular neurologist 1: 1.7 min vs 1.6 min; P=.64); vascular neurologist 2: 2.4 min vs 2.0 min; P=.14).
7500,3,The use of a smartphone app enables vascular neurologists to estimate DWI-ASPECTS accurately and rapidly. 
7501,3,The Join medical smartphone app shows great promise in the management of acute stroke.
7502,4,COVID-19-Related Information Sources and the Relationship With Confidence in People Coping with COVID-19: Facebook Survey Study in Taiwan
7503,0,People obtain information on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the internet and other sources. 
7504,0,Understanding the factors related to such information sources aids health professionals in educating individuals.
7505,1,A total of 1904 participants (1270 non-health-care workers and 634 health care workers) were recruited from the Facebook advertisement. 
7506,1,"Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed."
7507,2,Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. 
7508,2,"Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. "
7509,2,"For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19. "
7510,2,The significant association between receiving information from more sources and greater self-confidence was found only in health care workers but not in non-health-care workers.
7511,3,Medical professionals should consider subgroups of the population when establishing various means to deliver information on COVID-19.
7512,4,Use of a Real-Time Locating System for Contact Tracing of Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic at an Infectious Disease Center in Singapore: Validation Study
7513,0,"In early 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged and spread by community and nosocomial transmission. "
7514,0,Effective contact tracing of potentially exposed health care workers is crucial for the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the health care setting.
7515,1,"Over a 2-day study period, all admitted patients with COVID-19, their ward locations, and the health care workers rostered to each ward were identified to determine the total number of potential contacts between patients with COVID-19 and health care workers. "
7516,1,"The numbers of staff-patient contacts determined by EMR reviews, RTLS based contact tracing, and a combination of both methods were evaluated. "
7517,1,The use of EMR-based and RTLS-based contact tracing methods was further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by health care workers.
7518,2,"Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff members), 104 (13.1%) were identified by both the RTLS and EMR, 54 (6.8%) by the RTLS alone, and 99 (12.4%) by the EMR alone; 539 (67.7%) were not identified through either method. "
7519,2,"Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and a specificity of 77.9%, while the RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 87.7%. "
7520,2,"The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either the RTLS or the EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%)."
7521,3,RTLS-based contact tracing showed higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR review. 
7522,3,"Integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing of RTLS tags remain necessary."
7523,4,Toward a Risk-Utility Data Governance Framework for Research Using Genomic and Phenotypic Data in Safe Havens: Multifaceted Review
7524,0,Research using genomic data opens up new insights into health and disease. 
7525,0,Being able to use the data in association with health and administrative record data held in safe havens can multiply the benefits. 
7526,0,"However, there is much discussion about the use of genomic data with perceptions of particular challenges in doing so safely and effectively."
7527,1,"We carried out a multifaceted review drawing upon data governance arrangements in published research, case studies of organizations working with genomic and phenotypic data, public views and expectations, and example studies using genomic and phenotypic data in combination. "
7528,1,The findings were contextualized against a backdrop of legislative and regulatory requirements and used to create recommendations.
7529,2,We proposed recommendations toward a risk-utility model with a flexible suite of controls to safeguard privacy and retain data utility for research. 
7530,2,These were presented as overarching principles aligned to the core elements in the data sharing framework produced by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health and as practical control measures distilled from published literature and case studies of operational safe havens to be applied as required at a project-specific level.
7531,3,"The recommendations presented can be used to contribute toward a proportionate data governance framework to promote the safe, socially acceptable use of genomic and phenotypic data in safe havens. "
7532,3,They do not purport to eradicate risk but propose case-by-case assessment with transparency and accountability. 
7533,3,"If the risks are adequately understood and mitigated, there should be no reason that linked genomic and phenotypic data should not be used in an anonymized form for research in safe havens."
7534,4,Chinese Publics Attention to the COVID-19 Epidemic on Social Media: Observational Descriptive Study
7535,0,"Since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media."
7536,1,"We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. "
7537,1,"ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. "
7538,1,We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. 
7539,1,We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content.
7540,2,The study has four main findings. 
7541,2,"First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. "
7542,2,"Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. "
7543,2,"Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. "
7544,2,"Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases."
7545,3,"Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies. "
7546,3,"During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. "
7547,3,We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. 
7548,3,These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.
7549,4,Artificial Intelligence-Based Differential Diagnosis: Development and Validation of a Probabilistic Model to Address Lack of Large-Scale Clinical Datasets
7550,0,Machine-learning or deep-learning algorithms for clinical diagnosis are inherently dependent on the availability of large-scale clinical datasets. 
7551,0,Lack of such datasets and inherent problems such as overfitting often necessitate the development of innovative solutions. 
7552,0,Probabilistic modeling closely mimics the rationale behind clinical diagnosis and represents a unique solution.
7553,1,Numerical values of symptom-disease associations were utilized to mathematically represent medical domain knowledge. 
7554,1,These values served as the core engine for the probabilistic model. 
7555,1,"For the given set of symptoms, the model was utilized to produce a ranked list of differential diagnoses, which was compared to the differential diagnosis constructed by a physician in a consult. "
7556,1,Practicing medical specialists were integral in the development and validation of this model. 
7557,1,Clinical vignettes (patient case studies) were utilized to compare the accuracy of doctors and the model against the assumed gold standard. 
7558,1,"The accuracy analysis was carried out over the following metrics: top 3 accuracy, precision, and recall."
7559,2,The model demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (P=.002) in diagnostic accuracy (85%) as compared to the doctors' performance (67%). 
7560,2,"This advantage was retained across all three categories of clinical vignettes: 100% vs 82% (P<.001) for highly specific disease presentation, 83% vs 65% for moderately specific disease presentation (P=.005), and 72% vs 49% (P<.001) for nonspecific disease presentation. "
7561,2,"The model performed slightly better than the doctors' average in precision (62% vs 60%, P=.43) but there was no improvement with respect to recall (53% vs 56%, P=.27). "
7562,2,"However, neither difference was statistically significant."
7563,3,The present study demonstrates a drastic improvement over previously reported results that can be attributed to the development of a stable probabilistic framework utilizing symptom-disease associations to mathematically represent medical domain knowledge. 
7564,3,"The current iteration relies on static, manually curated values for calculating the degree of association. "
7565,3,Shifting to real-world data-derived values represents the next step in model development.
7566,4,Massive Open Online Course Evaluation Methods: Systematic Review
7567,0,Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have the potential to make a broader educational impact because many learners undertake these courses. 
7568,0,"Despite their reach, there is a lack of knowledge about which methods are used for evaluating these courses."
7569,1,"We systematically searched the following databases for studies published from January 2008 to October 2018: (1) Scopus, (2) Education Resources Information Center, (3) IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) Xplore, (4) PubMed, (5) Web of Science, (6) British Education Index, and (7) Google Scholar search engine. "
7570,1,Two reviewers independently screened the abstracts and titles of the studies. 
7571,1,Published studies in the English language that evaluated MOOCs were included. 
7572,1,"The study design of the evaluations, the underlying motivation for the evaluation studies, data collection, and data analysis methods were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. "
7573,1,"The quality of the included studies was appraised using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the National Institutes of Health-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tool for cohort observational studies and for before-after (pre-post) studies with no control group."
7574,2,"The initial search resulted in 3275 studies, and 33 eligible studies were included in this review. "
7575,2,"In total, 16 studies used a quantitative study design, 11 used a qualitative design, and 6 used a mixed methods study design. "
7576,2,"In all, 16 studies evaluated learner characteristics and behavior, and 20 studies evaluated learning outcomes and experiences. "
7577,2,"A total of 12 studies used 1 data source, 11 used 2 data sources, 7 used 3 data sources, 4 used 2 data sources, and 1 used 5 data sources. "
7578,2,"Overall, 3 studies used more than 3 data sources in their evaluation. "
7579,2,"In terms of the data analysis methods, quantitative methods were most prominent with descriptive and inferential statistics, which were the top 2 preferred methods. "
7580,2,"In all, 26 studies with a cross-sectional design had a low-quality assessment, whereas RCTs and quasi-experimental studies received a high-quality assessment."
7581,3,The MOOC evaluation data collection and data analysis methods should be determined carefully on the basis of the aim of the evaluation. 
7582,3,"The MOOC evaluations are subject to bias, which could be reduced using pre-MOOC measures for comparison or by controlling for confounding variables. "
7583,3,Future MOOC evaluations should consider using more diverse data sources and data analysis methods.
7584,4,Nurse-Physician Communication Team Training in Virtual Reality Versus Live Simulations: Randomized Controlled Trial on Team Communication and Teamwork Attitudes
7585,0,Interprofessional team training is needed to improve nurse-physician communication skills that are lacking in clinical practice. 
7586,0,Using simulations has proven to be an effective learning approach for team training. 
7587,0,"Yet, it has logistical constraints that call for the exploration of virtual environments in delivering team training."
7588,1,"In June 2018, the authors implemented nurse-physician communication team training using communication tools. "
7589,1,A randomized controlled trial study was conducted with 120 undergraduate medical and nursing students who were randomly assigned to undertake team training using virtual reality or live simulations. 
7590,1,The participants from both groups were tested on their communication performances through team-based simulation assessments. 
7591,1,"Their teamwork attitudes were evaluated using interprofessional attitude surveys that were administered before, immediately after, and 2 months after the study interventions."
7592,2,The team-based simulation assessment revealed no significant differences in the communication performance posttest scores (P=.29) between the virtual and simulation groups. 
7593,2,"Both groups reported significant increases in the interprofessional attitudes posttest scores from the baseline scores, with no significant differences found between the groups over the 3 time points."
7594,3,"Our study outcomes did not show an inferiority of team training using virtual reality when compared with live simulations, which supports the potential use of virtual reality to substitute conventional simulations for communication team training. "
7595,3,Future studies can leverage the use of artificial intelligence technology in virtual reality to replace costly human-controlled facilitators to achieve better scalability and sustainability of team-based training in interprofessional education.
7596,4,Use of Rapid Online Surveys to Assess Peoples Perceptions During Infectious Disease Outbreaks: A Cross-sectional Survey on COVID-19
7597,0,"Given the extensive time needed to conduct a nationally representative household survey and the commonly low response rate of phone surveys, rapid online surveys may be a promising method to assess and track knowledge and perceptions among the general public during fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks."
7598,1,An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United States and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. 
7599,1,"Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or >= 58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or ""other""), as well as all permutations of these strata. "
7600,1,The number of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. 
7601,1,"Enrollment into the survey within each stratum was on a first-come, first-served basis. "
7602,1,"Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020."
7603,2,"A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. "
7604,2,"Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between 15,000 pound and 74,999 pound. "
7605,2,"US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively. "
7606,2,Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. 
7607,2,"However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. "
7608,2,"For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was ""highly effective"" in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. "
7609,2,"Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2."
7610,3,The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the US and UK general population. 
7611,3,"The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. "
7612,3,"More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public's knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks."
7613,4,Precourse Preparation Using a Serious Smartphone Game on Advanced Life Support Knowledge and Skills: Randomized Controlled Trial
7614,0,"In the past several years, gamified learning has been growing in popularity in various medical educational contexts including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training. "
7615,0,"Furthermore, prior work in Basic Life Support (BLS) training has demonstrated the benefits of serious games as a method for pretraining among medical students. "
7616,0,"However, there is little evidence to support these benefits with regard to Advanced Life Support (ALS) training."
7617,1,A serious game (Resus Days) was developed by a Thai physician based on global ALS clinical practice guidelines. 
7618,1,Fifth-year medical students were enrolled and randomized to either the game group or the control group. 
7619,1,"Participants in both groups attended a traditional ALS lecture, but the game group was assigned to play Resus Days for 1 hour before attending the lecture and were allowed to play as much as they wished during the training course. "
7620,1,"All students underwent conventional ALS training, and their abilities were evaluated using multiple-choice questions and with hands-on practice on a mannequin. "
7621,1,Subject attitudes and perceptions about the game were evaluated using a questionnaire.
7622,2,A total of 105 students participated in the study and were randomly assigned to either the game group (n=52) or the control group (n=53). 
7623,2,"Students in the game group performed better on the ALS algorithm knowledge posttest than those in the control group (17.22 [SD 1.93] vs 16.60 [SD 1.97], P=.01; adjusted mean difference [AMD] 0.93; 95% CI 0.21-1.66). "
7624,2,"The game group's pass rate on the skill test was also higher but not to a statistically significant extent (79% vs 66%, P=.09; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.22; 95% CI 0.89-5.51). "
7625,2,Students indicated high satisfaction with the game (9.02 [SD 1.11] out of 10).
7626,3,Engaging in game-based preparation prior to an ALS training course resulted in better algorithm knowledge scores for medical students than attending the course alone.
7627,4,Serious Gaming During Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation for Patients With Chronic Pain or Fatigue Symptoms: Mixed Methods Design of a Realist Process Evaluation
7628,0,Serious gaming could support patients in learning to cope with chronic pain or functional somatic syndromes and reduce symptom burdens.
7629,1,"Following a realist approach, process evaluations were performed before, during, and after a two-armed, natural quasi-experiment (n=275). "
7630,1,A group of patients with interfering chronic pain or fatigue symptoms received a short additional blended mindfulness-based serious gaming intervention during a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. 
7631,1,A control group only received the regular rehabilitation program. 
7632,1,"During two sessions before and one session after the experiment, expectations about serious gaming processes were discussed in focus groups with local care providers, implementers, and experts. "
7633,1,Patients participated in a survey (n=114) and in semistructured interviews (n=10). 
7634,1,"The qualitative data were used to develop tentative expectations about aspects of serious gaming that, in certain patients and circumstances, trigger mechanisms of learning and health outcome change. "
7635,1,"Hypotheses about indicative quantitative data patterns for tentative expectations were formulated before inspecting, describing, and analyzing-with regression models-routinely collected clinical outcome data. "
7636,1,An updated program theory was formulated after mixing the qualitative and quantitative results.
7637,2,Qualitative data showed that a subset of patients perceived improvement of their self-awareness in moments of daily social interactions. 
7638,2,"These results were explained by patients, who played the serious game LAKA, as a ""confrontation with yourself,"" which reflected self-discrepancies. "
7639,2,"Important characteristics of serious gaming in the study's context included innovation factors of relative advantage with experiential learning opportunity, compatibility with the treatment approach, and the limited flexibility in regard to patient preferences. "
7640,2,Perceived patient factors included age and style of coping with stress or pain. 
7641,2,"Learning perceptions could also depend on care provider role-taking and the planning and facilitating (ie, local organization) of serious gaming introduction and feedback sessions in small groups of patients. "
7642,2,"Quantitative data showed very small average differences between the study groups in self-reported depression, pain, and fatigue changes (-.07<beta<-.17, all 95% CI upper bounds <0), which were mediated by small group differences in midfulness (beta=.26, 95% CI .02-51.). "
7643,2,"Mindfulness changes were positively associated with patient involvement in serious gaming (n=114, beta=.36, p=001). "
7644,2,Acceptance of serious gaming was lower in older patients. 
7645,2,Average health outcome changes went up to a medium size in patients that reported lower active coping with stress and lower pain coping before serious gaming Mindfulness changes and gaming acceptance perceptions covaried with group structure and immediate feedback sessions after serious gaming.
7646,3,This study developed transferable insight into how and why serious gaming can facilitate additional learning about coping in order to reduce burdens of chronic pain or fatigue symptoms in certain patients and in actual treatment circumstances. 
7647,3,Future studies are needed to continue the development of this fallible theory. 
7648,3,"Such research will further support decisions about using, designing, allocating, and tailoring serious gaming to optimize important patient health benefits."
7649,4,Improvement of the Efficiency and Completeness of Neuro-Oncology Patient Referrals to a Tertiary Center Through the Implementation of an Electronic Referral System: Retrospective Cohort Study
7650,0,"Quality referrals to specialist care are key for prompt, optimal decisions about the management of patients with brain tumors."
7651,1,"We carried out a retrospective cohort study based on the review of medical records of referred adult patients, excluding follow-ups. "
7652,1,Primary outcome measures were durations of three key phases within the referral pathway and completion rates of six referral fields.
7653,2,A total of 248 patients were referred to the specialist center during the study period. 
7654,2,"Median (IQR) diagnostic imaging to referral intervals were 3 (1-5) days with eReferrals, and 9 (4-19), 19 (14-49), and 8 (4-23) days with paper proforma, paper letter, and internal referrals, respectively (P<.001). "
7655,2,"Median (IQR) referral to multidisciplinary team decision intervals were 3 (2-7), 2 (1-3), 8 (2-24), and 3 (2-6) days respectively (P=.01). "
7656,2,"For patients having surgery, median (IQR) diagnostic imaging to surgery intervals were 28 (21-41), 34 (27-51), 104 (69-143), and 32 (15-89) days, respectively (P<.001). "
7657,2,"Proportions of complete fields differed significantly by referral type in all study fields (all with Ps <.001) except for details of presentation, which were present in all referrals. "
7658,2,"All study fields were always present in eReferrals, as these are compulsory for referral submission. "
7659,2,"Depending on the data field, level of completeness in the remaining referral types ranged within 69% (65/94) to 87% (82/94), 15% (3/20) to 65% (13/20), and 22% (8/41) to 63% (26/41) in paper proforma, paper letter, and internal referrals, respectively."
7660,3,"An electronic, Web-based, service-developed specific proforma for neuro-oncology referrals performs significantly better, with shorter waiting times and greater completeness of information than other referral types. "
7661,3,A wider application of eReferrals is an important first step to streamlining specialist care pathways and providing excellent care.
7662,4,Impact of Illness on Electronic Health Use (The Seventh Tromso Study - Part 2): Population-Based Questionnaire Study
7663,0,Patients who suffer from different diseases may use different electronic health (eHealth) resources. 
7664,0,"Thus, those who plan eHealth interventions should take into account which eHealth resources are used most frequently by patients that suffer from different diseases."
7665,1,Data from the seventh survey of the Tromso Study (Tromso 7) were analyzed to determine how different diseases influence the use of different eHealth resources. 
7666,1,"Specifically, the eHealth resources considered were use of apps, search engines, video services, and social media. "
7667,1,"The analysis contained data from 21,083 participants in the age group older than 40 years. "
7668,1,"A total of 15,585 (15,585/21,083; 73.92%) participants reported to have suffered some disease, 10,604 (10,604/21,083; 50.29%) participants reported to have used some kind of eHealth resource in the last year, and 7854 (7854/21,083; 37.25%) participants reported to have used some kind of eHealth resource in the last year and suffered (or had suffered) from some kind of specified disease. "
7669,1,Logistic regression was used to determine which diseases significantly predicted the use of each eHealth resource.
7670,2,"The use of apps was increased among those individuals that (had) suffered from psychological problems (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% CI 1.23-1.56) and cardiovascular diseases (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24) and those part-time workers that (had) suffered from any of the diseases classified as others (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.35-3.32). "
7671,2,"The use of search engines for accessing health information increased among individuals who suffered from psychological problems (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.25-1.55), cancer (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11-1.44), or any of the diseases classified as other diseases (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.42). "
7672,2,"Regarding video services, their use for accessing health information was more likely when the participant was a man (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13-1.53), (had) suffered from psychological problems (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.43-2.01), or (had) suffered from other diseases (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.20-1.71). "
7673,2,"The factors associated with an increase in the use of social media for accessing health information were as follows: (had) suffered from psychological problems (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.42-1.91), working part time (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.62-2.63), receiving disability benefits (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14-1.76), having received an upper secondary school education (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.38), being a man with a high household income (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.07-2.60), suffering from cardiovascular diseases and having a high household income (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.62-8.16), and suffering from respiratory diseases while being retired (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.28-2.97)."
7674,3,Our findings show that different diseases are currently associated with the use of different eHealth resources. 
7675,3,This knowledge is useful for those who plan eHealth interventions as they can take into account which type of eHealth resource may be used for gaining the attention of the different user groups.
7676,4,The Effects of a Digital Well-Being Intervention on Patients With Chronic Conditions: Observational Study
7677,0,"Chronic conditions account for 75% of health care costs, and the impact of chronic illness is expected to grow over time. "
7678,0,"Although subjective well-being predicts better health outcomes, people with chronic conditions tend to report lower well-being. "
7679,0,"Improving well-being might mitigate costs associated with chronic illness; however, existing interventions can be difficult to access and draw from a single theoretical approach. "
7680,0,"Happify, a digital well-being intervention program drawing from multiple theoretical traditions to target well-being, has already been established as an efficacious means of improving well-being in both distressed and nondistressed users."
7681,1,"Data were obtained from Happify users, a publicly available digital well-being program accessible via website or mobile phone app. "
7682,1,"Users work on tracks addressing a specific issue (eg, conquering negative thoughts) composed of games and activities based on positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and mindfulness principles. "
7683,1,The sample included 821 users receiving at least 6 weeks' exposure to Happify (ranging from 42 to 179 days) who met other inclusion criteria. 
7684,1,"As part of a baseline questionnaire, respondents reported demographic information (age and gender) and whether they had any of the prespecified chronic conditions: arthritis, diabetes, insomnia, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, psoriasis, eczema, or some other condition (450 reported a chronic condition, whereas 371 did not). "
7685,1,"Subjective well-being was assessed with the Happify Scale, a 9-item measure of positive emotionality and life satisfaction. "
7686,1,"To evaluate changes in well-being over time, a mixed effects linear regression model was fit for subjective well-being, controlling for demographics and platform usage."
7687,2,"At baseline, users with a chronic condition had significantly lower subjective well-being (mean 38.34, SD 17.40) than users without a chronic condition (mean 43.65, SD 19.13). "
7688,2,"However, change trajectories for users with or without a chronic condition were not significantly different; both groups experienced equivalent improvements in well-being. "
7689,2,"We also found an effect for time from baseline (b=0.071; SE=0.010; P<.01) and number of activities completed (b=0.03; SE=0.009; P<.01), and a 2-way interaction between number of activities completed and time from baseline (b=0.0002; SE=0.00006; P<.01), such that completing more activities and doing so over increasingly longer periods produced improved well-being scores."
7690,3,Data from this study support the conclusion that users with a chronic condition experienced significant improvement over time. 
7691,3,"Despite reporting lower subjective well-being on the whole, their change trajectory while using Happify was equivalent to those without a chronic condition. "
7692,3,"Consistent with past research, users who completed more activities over a longer period showed the most improvement. "
7693,3,"In short, the presence of a chronic condition did not prevent users from showing improved well-being when using Happify."
7694,4,"Patient-Reported Outcomes in Online Communications on Statins, Memory, and Cognition: Qualitative Analysis Using Online Communities"
7695,0,"In drug development clinical trials, there is a need for balance between restricting variables by setting eligibility criteria and representing the broader patient population that may use a product once it is approved. "
7696,0,"Similarly, although recent policy initiatives focusing on the inclusion of historically underrepresented groups are being implemented, barriers still remain. "
7697,0,These limitations of clinical trials may mask potential product benefits and side effects. 
7698,0,"To bridge these gaps, online communication in health communities may serve as an additional population signal for drug side effects."
7699,1,"Researchers utilized user-generated content on Inspire, looking at over 11 million posts across Inspire. "
7700,1,Posts were written by patients and caregivers belonging to a variety of communities on Inspire. 
7701,1,"After identifying these posts, researchers used NLP and hands-on linguistic analysis to draw and expand upon correlations among statin use, memory, and cognition."
7702,2,"NLP analysis of posts identified statistical correlations between statin users and the discussion of memory impairment, which were not observed in control groups. "
7703,2,"NLP found that, out of all members on Inspire, 3.1% had posted about memory or cognition. "
7704,2,"In a control group of those who had posted about TNF inhibitors, 6.2% had also posted about memory and cognition. "
7705,2,"In comparison, of all those who had posted about a statin medication, 22.6% (P<.001) also posted about memory and cognition. "
7706,2,"Furthermore, linguistic analysis of a sample of posts provided themes and context to these statistical findings. "
7707,2,"By looking at posts from statin users about memory, four key themes were found and described in detail in the data: memory loss, aphasia, cognitive impairment, and emotional change."
7708,3,Correlations from this study point to a need for further research on the impact of statins on memory and cognition. 
7709,3,"Furthermore, when using nontraditional datasets, such as online communities, NLP and linguistic methodologies broaden the population for identifying side-effect signals. "
7710,3,"For side effects such as those on memory and cognition, where self-reporting may be unreliable, these methods can provide another avenue to inform patients, providers, and the Food and Drug Administration."
7711,4,Relating Instructional Design Components to the Effectiveness of Internet-Based Mindfulness Interventions: A Critical Interpretive Synthesis
7712,0,"Internet-based mindfulness interventions are a promising approach to address challenges in the dissemination and implementation of mindfulness interventions, but it is unclear how the instructional design components of such interventions are associated with intervention effectiveness."
7713,1,The critical interpretive synthesis method was applied. 
7714,1,"In phase 1, a strategic literature review was conducted to generate hypotheses for the relationship between the effectiveness of internet-based mindfulness interventions and the instructional design components of those interventions. "
7715,1,"In phase 2, the literature review was extended to systematically explore and revise the hypotheses from phase 1."
7716,2,A total of 18 studies were identified in phase 1; 14 additional studies were identified in phase 2. 
7717,2,"Of the 32 internet-based mindfulness interventions, 18 were classified as more effective, 11 as less effective, and only 3 as ineffective. "
7718,2,The effectiveness of the interventions increased with the level of support provided by the instructional design components. 
7719,2,The main difference between effective and ineffective interventions was the presence of just-in-time information in the form of reminders. 
7720,2,"More effective interventions included more supportive information (scores: 1.91 in phases 1 and 2) than less effective interventions (scores: 1.00 in phase 1 and 1.80 in phase 2), more part-task practice (scores: 1.18 in phase 1 and 1.60 in phase 2) than less effective interventions (scores: 0.33 in phase 1 and 1.40 in phase 2), and provided more just-in-time information (scores: 1.35 in phase 1 and 1.67 in phase 2) than less effective interventions (scores: 0.83 in phase 1 and 1.60 in phase 2). "
7721,2,"The average duration of more effective, less effective, and ineffective interventions differed for the studies of phase 1, with more effective interventions taking up more time (7.45 weeks) than less effective (4.58 weeks) or ineffective interventions (3 weeks). "
7722,2,"However, this difference did not extend to the studies of phase 2, with comparable average durations of effective (5.86 weeks), less effective (5.6 weeks), and ineffective (7 weeks) interventions."
7723,3,"Our results suggest that to be effective, internet-based mindfulness interventions must contain 4 instructional design components: formal learning tasks, supportive information, part-task practice, and just-in-time information. "
7724,3,The effectiveness of the interventions increases with the level of support provided by each of these instructional design components.
7725,4,Performance of Fetal Medicine Foundation Software for Pre-Eclampsia Prediction Upon Marker Customization: Cross-Sectional Study
7726,0,There is a pioneer algorithm developed by Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) to predict pre-eclampsia on the basis of maternal characteristics combined with biophysical and biochemical markers. 
7727,0,"The Afro-Caribbean ethnicity is the second risk factor, in magnitude, found in populations tested by FMF, which was not confirmed in a Brazilian scenario."
7728,1,"It was a cross-sectional observational study, with secondary evaluation of data from FMF first trimester screening tests of singleton pregnancies. "
7729,1,"Risk scores were calculated from maternal characteristics and biophysical markers, and they were presented as the risk for early pre-eclampsia (PE34) and preterm pre-eclampsia (PE37). "
7730,1,"The following steps were followed: (1) identification of women characterized as black ethnicity; (2) calculation of early and preterm pre-eclampsia risk, reclassifying them as white, which generated a new score; (3) comparison of the proportions of women categorized as high risk between the original and new scores; (4) construction of the receiver operator characteristic curve; (5) calculation of the area under the curve, sensitivity, and false positive rate; and (6) comparison of the area under the curve, sensitivity, and false positive rate of the original with the new risk by chi-square test."
7731,2,"A total of 1531 cases were included in the final sample, with 219 out of 1531 cases (14.30; 95% CI 12.5-16.0) and 182 out of 1531 cases (11.88%; 95% CI 10.3-13.5) classified as high risk for pre-eclampsia development, originally and after recalculating the new risk, respectively. "
7732,2,"The comparison of FMF2012 predictive model performance between the originally estimated risks and the estimated new risks showed that the difference was not significant for sensitivity and area under the curve, but it was significant for false positive rate."
7733,3,We concluded that black ethnicity classification of Brazilian pregnant women by FMF2012 algorithm increases the false positive rate. 
7734,3,Suppressing ethnicity effect did not improve the test sensitivity. 
7735,3,"By modifying demographic characteristics, it is possible to improve some performance aspects of clinical prediction tests."
7736,4,Smartphone Apps to Support Coordinated Specialty Care for Prodromal and Early Course Schizophrenia Disorders: Systematic Review
7737,0,"Demand for mental health services, especially for clinical high-risk and early psychosis, has increased, creating a need for new solutions to increase access to and quality of care. "
7738,0,"Smartphones and mobile technology are potential tools to support coordinated specialty care for early psychosis, given their potential to augment the six core roles of care: case management and team leadership, recovery-oriented psychotherapy, medication management, support for employment and education, coordination with primary care services, and family education and support. "
7739,0,"However, the services smartphones are actually offering specifically for coordinated specialty care and the level of evidence are unknown."
7740,1,"A systematic literature search was conducted on August 16 and 17, 2019, using the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, and PsycINFO electronic databases. "
7741,1,The eligible studies were reviewed and screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
7742,2,"The search uncovered 388 unique results, of which 32 articles met the initial inclusion criteria; 21 eligible studies on 16 unique app platforms were identified. "
7743,2,"Feasibility studies showed a high user engagement and interest among patients, monitoring studies demonstrated a correlation between app assessments and clinical outcomes, and intervention studies indicated that these apps have the potential to advance care. "
7744,2,Eighteen studies reported on app use for the case management roles of coordinated specialty care. 
7745,2,"No app studies focused on employment and education, coordination with primary care services, and family education and support."
7746,3,"Although the published literature on smartphone apps for prodromal and first-episode psychosis is small, it is growing exponentially and holds promise to augment both monitoring and interventions. "
7747,3,"Although the research results and protocols for app studies are not well aligned with all coordinated specialty care roles today, high rates of adoption and feasibility suggest the potential for future efforts. "
7748,3,These results will be used to develop coordinated specialty care-specific app evaluation scales and toolkits.
7749,4,Automatically Appraising the Credibility of Vaccine-Related Web Pages Shared on Social Media: A Twitter Surveillance Study
7750,0,"Tools used to appraise the credibility of health information are time-consuming to apply and require context-specific expertise, limiting their use for quickly identifying and mitigating the spread of misinformation as it emerges."
7751,1,"Sampling from 143,003 unique vaccine-related Web pages shared on Twitter between January 2017 and March 2018, we used a 7-point checklist adapted from validated tools and guidelines to manually appraise the credibility of 474 Web pages. "
7752,1,"These were used to train several classifiers (random forests, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks) using the text from a Web page to predict whether the information satisfies each of the 7 criteria. "
7753,1,"Estimating the credibility of all other Web pages, we used the follower network to estimate potential exposures relative to a credibility score defined by the 7-point checklist."
7754,2,"The best-performing classifiers were able to distinguish between low, medium, and high credibility with an accuracy of 78% and labeled low-credibility Web pages with a precision of over 96%. "
7755,2,"Across the set of unique Web pages, 11.86% (16,961 of 143,003) were estimated as low credibility and they generated 9.34% (1.64 billion of 17.6 billion) of potential exposures. "
7756,2,The 100 most popular links to low credibility Web pages were each potentially seen by an estimated 2 million to 80 million Twitter users globally.
7757,3,"The results indicate that although a small minority of low-credibility Web pages reach a large audience, low-credibility Web pages tend to reach fewer users than other Web pages overall and are more commonly shared within certain subpopulations. "
7758,3,An automatic credibility appraisal tool may be useful for finding communities of users at higher risk of exposure to low-credibility vaccine communications.
7759,4,Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Integrated in Routine Clinical Care: Implementation Study
7760,0,"In a clinical trial, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (I-CBT) embedded in stepped care was established as noninferior to face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). "
7761,0,"However, treatment effects observed in clinical trials may not necessarily be retained after implementation."
7762,1,I-CBT was implemented in five mental health care centers (MHCs) with nine treatment sites throughout the Netherlands. 
7763,1,"All patients with CFS were offered I-CBT, followed by face-to-face CBT if still severely fatigued or disabled after I-CBT. "
7764,1,"Outcomes were the Checklist Individual Strength, physical and social functioning (Short-Form 36), and limitations in daily functioning according to the Work and Social Adjustment Scale. "
7765,1,The change scores (pre to post stepped care) were compared with a benchmark: stepped care from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing this treatment format. 
7766,1,We calculated correlations of therapists' attitudes toward manualized treatment and eHealth with reduction of fatigue severity.
7767,2,"Overall, 100 CFS patients were referred to the centers. "
7768,2,"Of them, 79 started with I-CBT, 20 commenced directly with face-to-face CBT, and one did not start at all. "
7769,2,"After I-CBT, 48 patients met step-up criteria; of them, 11 stepped up to face-to-face CBT. "
7770,2,"Increase in physical functioning (score of 13.4), social functioning (20.4), and reduction of limitations (10.3) after stepped care delivered in routine clinical care fell within the benchmarks of the RCT (95% CIs: 12.8-17.6; 25.2-7.8; and 7.4-9.8, respectively). "
7771,2,Reduction of fatigue severity in the MHCs was smaller (12.6) than in the RCT (95% CI 13.2-16.5). 
7772,2,"After I-CBT only, reduction of fatigue severity (13.2) fell within the benchmark of I-CBT alone (95% CI 11.1-14.2). "
7773,2,Twenty therapists treated between one and 18 patients. 
7774,2,Therapists were divided into two groups: one with the largest median reduction of fatigue and one with the smallest. 
7775,2,Patients treated by the first group had a significantly larger reduction of fatigue severity (15.7 vs 9.0; t=2.42; P=.02). 
7776,2,There were no (statistically significant) correlations between therapists' attitudes and reduction in fatigue.
7777,3,This study is one of the first to evaluate stepped care with I-CBT as a first step in routine clinical care. 
7778,3,"Although fatigue severity and disabilities were reduced, reduction of fatigue severity appeared smaller than in the clinical trial. "
7779,3,Further development of the treatment should aim at avoiding dropout and encouraging stepping up after I-CBT with limited results. 
7780,3,Median reduction of fatigue severity varied largely between therapists. 
7781,3,Further research will help understand the role of therapists' attitudes in treatment outcome.
7782,4,The Importance of Systematically Reporting and Reflecting on eHealth Development: Participatory Development Process of a Virtual Reality Application for Forensic Mental Health Care
7783,0,"The use of electronic health (eHealth) technologies in practice often is lower than expected, mostly because there is no optimal fit among a technology, the characteristics of prospective users, and their context. "
7784,0,"To improve this fit, a thorough systematic development process is recommended. "
7785,0,"However, more knowledge about suitable development methods is necessary to create a tool kit that guides researchers in choosing development methods that are appropriate for their context and users. "
7786,0,"In addition, there is a need for reflection on the existing frameworks for eHealth development to be able to constantly improve them."
7787,1,"In the development process, multiple methods were used to operationalize the first 2 phases of the CeHRes Roadmap: the contextual inquiry and value specification. "
7788,1,"To summarize the most relevant information for the goals of this study, the following information was extracted per method: (1) research goal, (2) explanation of the method used, (3) main results, (4) main conclusions, and (5) lessons learned about the method."
7789,2,Information on 10 methods used is presented in a structured manner. 
7790,2,"These 10 methods were stakeholder identification, project team composition, focus groups, literature study, semistructured interviews, idea generation with scenarios, Web-based questionnaire, value specification, idea generation with prototyping, and a second round of interviews. "
7791,2,"The lessons learned showed that although each method added new insights to the development process, not every method appeared to be the most appropriate for each research goal."
7792,3,"Reflection on the methods used pointed out that brief methods with concrete examples or scenarios fit the forensic psychiatric patients the best, among other things, because of difficulties with abstract reasoning and low motivation to invest much time in participating in research. "
7793,3,Formulating clear research questions based on a model's underlying principles and composing a multidisciplinary project team with prospective end users appeared to be important in this study. 
7794,3,The research questions supported the project team in keeping the complex development processes structured and prevented tunnel vision. 
7795,3,"With regard to the CeHRes Roadmap, continuous stakeholder involvement and formative evaluations were evaluated as strong points. "
7796,3,A suggestion to further improve the Roadmap is to explicitly integrate the use of domain-specific theories and models. 
7797,3,"To create a tool kit with a broad range of methods for eHealth development and further improve development models, studies that report and reflect on development processes in a consistent and structured manner are needed."
7798,4,Why Do Data Users Say Health Care Data Are Difficult to Use? A Cross-Sectional Survey Study
7799,0,There has been significant effort in attempting to use health care data. 
7800,0,"However, laws that protect patients' privacy have restricted data use because health care data contain sensitive information. "
7801,0,"Thus, discussions on privacy laws now focus on the active use of health care data beyond protection. "
7802,0,"However, current literature does not clarify the obstacles that make data usage and deidentification processes difficult or elaborate on users' needs for data linking from practical perspectives."
7803,1,We conducted a cross-sectional online survey. 
7804,1,"To recruit people who have used health care data, we publicized the promotion campaign and sent official documents to an academic society encouraging participation in the online survey."
7805,2,"In total, 128 participants responded to the online survey; 10 participants were excluded for either inconsistent responses or lack of demand for health care data. "
7806,2,"Finally, 118 participants' responses were analyzed. "
7807,2,"The majority of participants worked in general hospitals or universities (62/118, 52.5% and 51/118, 43.2%, respectively, multiple-choice answers). "
7808,2,"More than half of participants responded that they have a need for clinical data (82/118, 69.5%) and public data (76/118, 64.4%). "
7809,2,"Furthermore, 85.6% (101/118) of respondents conducted deidentification measures when using data, and they considered rigid social culture as an obstacle for deidentification (28/101, 27.7%). "
7810,2,"In addition, they required data linking (98/118, 83.1%), and they noted deregulation and data standardization to allow access to health care data linking (33/98, 33.7% and 38/98, 38.8%, respectively). "
7811,2,There were no significant differences in the proportion of responded data needs and linking in groups that used health care data for either public purposes or commercial purposes.
7812,3,"This study provides a cross-sectional view from a practical, user-oriented perspective on the kinds of data users want to utilize, efforts and difficulties in deidentification processes, and the needs for data linking. "
7813,3,"Most users want to use clinical and public data, and most participants conduct deidentification processes and express a desire to conduct data linking. "
7814,3,Our study confirmed that they noted regulation as a primary obstacle whether their purpose is commercial or public. 
7815,3,A legal system based on both data utilization and data protection needs is required.
7816,4,Identifying Key Target Audiences for Public Health Campaigns: Leveraging Machine Learning in the Case of Hookah Tobacco Smoking
7817,0,Hookah tobacco smoking (HTS) is a particularly important issue for public health professionals to address owing to its prevalence and deleterious health effects. 
7818,0,Social media sites can be a valuable tool for public health officials to conduct informational health campaigns. 
7819,0,Current social media platforms provide researchers with opportunities to better identify and target specific audiences and even individuals. 
7820,0,"However, we are not aware of systematic research attempting to identify audiences with mixed or ambivalent views toward HTS."
7821,1,We prospectively collected tweets related to HTS from January to June 2016. 
7822,1,"We double-coded sentiment for a subset of approximately 5000 randomly sampled tweets for sentiment toward HTS and used these data to train a machine learning classifier to assess the remaining approximately 556,000 HTS-related Twitter posts. "
7823,1,"Natural language processing software was used to extract linguistic features (ie, language-based covariates). "
7824,1,The data were processed by machine learning tools and algorithms using R. 
7825,1,"Finally, we used the results to identify individuals who, because they had consistently posted both positive and negative content, might be ambivalent toward HTS and represent an ideal audience for intervention."
7826,2,"There were 561,960 HTS-related tweets: 373,911 were classified as positive and 183,139 were classified as negative. "
7827,2,"A set of 12,861 users met a priori criteria indicating that they posted both positive and negative tweets about HTS."
7828,3,"Sentiment analysis can allow researchers to identify audience segments on social media that demonstrate ambiguity toward key public health issues, such as HTS, and therefore represent ideal populations for intervention. "
7829,3,Using large social media datasets can help public health officials to preemptively identify specific audience segments that would be most receptive to targeted campaigns.
7830,4,Virtual Patient Simulations in Health Professions Education: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis by the Digital Health Education Collaboration
7831,0,Virtual patients are interactive digital simulations of clinical scenarios for the purpose of health professions education. 
7832,0,There is no current collated evidence on the effectiveness of this form of education.
7833,1,We performed a systematic review on the effectiveness of virtual patient simulations in pre- and postregistration health professions education following Cochrane methodology. 
7834,1,We searched 7 databases from the year 1990 up to September 2018. 
7835,1,No language restrictions were applied. 
7836,1,We included randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized trials. 
7837,1,"We independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and then compared the information in pairs. "
7838,1,We contacted study authors for additional information if necessary. 
7839,1,All pooled analyses were based on random-effects models.
7840,2,A total of 51 trials involving 4696 participants met our inclusion criteria. 
7841,2,"Furthermore, 25 studies compared virtual patients with traditional education, 11 studies investigated virtual patients as blended learning, 5 studies compared virtual patients with different forms of digital education, and 10 studies compared different design variants. "
7842,2,"The pooled analysis of studies comparing the effect of virtual patients to traditional education showed similar results for knowledge (standardized mean difference [SMD]=0.11, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.39, I-2=74%, n=927) and favored virtual patients for skills (SMD=0.90, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32, I-2=88%, n=897). "
7843,2,Studies measuring attitudes and satisfaction predominantly used surveys with item-by-item comparison. 
7844,2,Trials comparing virtual patients with different forms of digital education and design variants were not numerous enough to give clear recommendations. 
7845,2,Several methodological limitations in the included studies and heterogeneity contributed to a generally low quality of evidence.
7846,3,"Low to modest and mixed evidence suggests that when compared with traditional education, virtual patients can more effectively improve skills, and at least as effectively improve knowledge. "
7847,3,"The skills that improved were clinical reasoning, procedural skills, and a mix of procedural and team skills. "
7848,3,"We found evidence of effectiveness in both high-income and low-and middle-income countries, demonstrating the global applicability of virtual patients. "
7849,3,Further research should explore the utility of different design variants of virtual patients.
7850,4,Use and Understanding of Anonymization and De-Identification in the Biomedical Literature: Scoping Review
7851,0,The secondary use of health data is central to biomedical research in the era of data science and precision medicine. 
7852,0,"National and international initiatives, such as the Global Open Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (GO FAIR) initiative, are supporting this approach in different ways (eg, making the sharing of research data mandatory or improving the legal and ethical frameworks). "
7853,0,Preserving patients' privacy is crucial in this context. 
7854,0,De-identification and anonymization are the two most common terms used to refer to the technical approaches that protect privacy and facilitate the secondary use of health data. 
7855,0,"However, it is difficult to find a consensus on the definitions of the concepts or on the reliability of the techniques used to apply them. "
7856,0,"A comprehensive review is needed to better understand the domain, its capabilities, its challenges, and the ratio of risk between the data subjects' privacy on one side, and the benefit of scientific advances on the other."
7857,1,"Based on a scoping review protocol designed a priori, MEDLINE was searched for publications discussing de-identification or anonymization and published between 2007 and 2017. "
7858,1,The search was restricted to MEDLINE to focus on the life sciences community The screening process was performed by two reviewers independently.
7859,2,"After searching 7972 records that matched at least one search term, 135 publications were screened and 60 full-text articles were included. "
7860,2,"(1) Terminology: Definitions of the terms de-identification and anonymization were provided in less than half of the articles (29/60, 48%). "
7861,2,"When both terms were used (41/60, 68%), their meanings divided the authors into two equal groups (19/60, 32%, each) with opposed views. "
7862,2,"The remaining articles (3/60, 5%) were equivocal. "
7863,2,"(2) Backgrounds and locations: Research groups were based predominantly in North America (31/60, 52%) and in the European Union (22/60, 37%). "
7864,2,"The authors came from 19 different domains; computer science (91/248, 36.7%), biomedical informatics (47/248, 19.0%), and medicine (38/248, 15.3%) were the most prevalent ones. "
7865,2,(3) Purpose: The main reason declared for applying these techniques is to facilitate biomedical research. 
7866,2,"(4) Limitations: Progress is made on specific techniques but, overall, limitations remain numerous. "
7867,2,"(5) Legal and ethical aspects: Differences exist between nations in the definitions, approaches, and legal practices. "
7868,2,"(6) Recommendations: The combination of organizational, legal, ethical, and technical approaches is necessary to protect health data."
7869,3,Interest is growing for privacy-enhancing techniques in the life sciences community. 
7870,3,"This interest crosses scientific boundaries, involving primarily computer science, biomedical informatics, and medicine. "
7871,3,The variability observed in the use of the terms de-identification and anonymization emphasizes the need for clearer definitions as well as for better education and dissemination of information on the subject. 
7872,3,The same observation applies to the methods. 
7873,3,"Several legislations, such as the American Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), regulate the domain Using the definitions they provide could help address the variable use of these two concepts in the research community."
7874,4,Discovering Clinical Information Models Online to Promote Interoperability of Electronic Health Records: A Feasibility Study of OpenEHR
7875,0,Clinical information models (CIMs) enabling semantic interoperability are crucial for electronic health record (EHR) data use and reuse. 
7876,0,"Dual model methodology, which distinguishes the CIMs from the technical domain, could help enable the interoperability of EHRs at the knowledge level. "
7877,0,How to help clinicians and domain experts discover CIMs from an open repository online to represent EHR data in a standard manner becomes important.
7878,1,We proposed a graphical retrieval method and validated its feasibility using an online CIM repository: openEHR Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM). 
7879,1,"First, we represented CIMs (archetypes) using an extended Bayesian network. "
7880,1,"Then, an inference process was run in the network to discover relevant archetypes. "
7881,1,"In the evaluation, we defined three retrieval tasks (medication, laboratory test, and diagnosis) and compared our method with three typical retrieval methods (BM25F, simple Bayesian network, and CKM), using mean average precision (MAP), average precision (AP), and precision at 10 (P@10) as evaluation metrics."
7882,2,We downloaded all available archetypes from the CKM. 
7883,2,"Then, the graphical model was applied to represent the archetypes as a four-level clinical resources network. "
7884,2,"The network consisted of 5513 nodes, including 3982 data element nodes, 504 concept nodes, 504 duplicated concept nodes, and 523 archetype nodes, as well as 9867 edges. "
7885,2,"The results showed that our method achieved the best MAP (MAP=0.32), and the AP was almost equal across different retrieval tasks (AP=0.35, 0.31, and 0.30, respectively). "
7886,2,"In the diagnosis retrieval task, our method could successfully identify the models covering ""diagnostic reports,"" ""problem list,"" ""patients background,"" ""clinical decision,"" etc, as well as models that other retrieval methods could not find, such as ""problems and diagnoses."""
7887,3,The graphical retrieval method we propose is an effective approach to meet the uncertainty of finding CIMs. 
7888,3,"Our method can help clinicians and domain experts identify CIMs to represent EHR data in a standard manner, enabling EHR data to be exchangeable and interoperable."
7889,4,"Credibility, Accuracy, and Comprehensiveness of Internet-Based Information About Low Back Pain: A Systematic Review"
7890,0,"Low back pain (LBP) affects millions of people worldwide, and misconceptions about effective treatment options for this condition are very common. "
7891,0,"Websites sponsored by organizations recognized as trustworthy by the public, such as government agencies, hospitals, universities, professional associations, health care organizations and consumer organizations are an important source of health information for many people. "
7892,0,"However, the content of these websites regarding treatment recommendations for LBP has not been fully evaluated."
7893,1,"We conducted a systematic review of websites from government agencies, hospitals, universities, professional associations, health care organizations and consumer organizations. "
7894,1,We conducted searches on Google. 
7895,1,Treatment recommendations were coded based on the 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and the 2017 American College of Physicians guideline on LBP. 
7896,1,"Primary outcomes were credibility of the website (4-item Journal of the American Medical Association benchmark), accuracy (proportion of website treatment recommendations that were appropriate), and comprehensiveness of website treatment recommendations (proportion of guideline treatment recommendations that were appropriately covered by a website)."
7897,2,We included 79 websites from 6 English-speaking countries. 
7898,2,"In terms of credibility, 31% (25/79) of the websites clearly disclosed that they had been updated after the publication of the NICE guidelines. "
7899,2,Only 43.28% (487/1125) website treatment recommendations were judged as accurate. 
7900,2,Comprehensiveness of treatment recommendations correctly covered by websites was very low across all types of LBP. 
7901,2,"For acute LBP, an average of 28% (4/14) guideline recommendations were correctly covered by websites. "
7902,2,"Websites for radicular LBP were the least comprehensive, correctly covering an average of 16% (2.3/14) recommendations."
7903,3,"Noncommercial freely accessible websites demonstrated low credibility standards, provided mostly inaccurate information, and lacked comprehensiveness across all types of LBP."
7904,4,Using Machine Learning to Derive Just-In-Time and Personalized Predictors of Stress: Observational Study Bridging the Gap Between Nomothetic and Ideographic Approaches
7905,0,Investigations into person-specific predictors of stress have typically taken either a population-level nomothetic approach or an individualized ideographic approach. 
7906,0,Nomothetic approaches can quickly identify predictors but can be hindered by the heterogeneity of these predictors across individuals and time. 
7907,0,Ideographic approaches may result in more predictive models at the individual level but require a longer period of data collection to identify robust predictors.
7908,1,Data collected in a 1-year observational study of 79 participants performing low levels of exercise were used. 
7909,1,Physical activity was continuously and objectively monitored by actigraphy. 
7910,1,Perceived stress was recorded by participants via daily ecological momentary assessments on a mobile app. 
7911,1,"Environmental variables including daylight time, temperature, and precipitation were retrieved from the public archives. "
7912,1,"Using these environmental, actigraphy, and mobile assessment data, we built machine learning models to predict individual stress ratings using linear, decision tree, and neural network techniques employing nomothetic and ideographic approaches. "
7913,1,The accuracy of the approaches for predicting individual stress ratings was compared based on classification errors.
7914,2,"Across the group of patients, an individual's recent history of stress ratings was most heavily weighted in predicting a future stress rating in the nomothetic recurrent neural network model, whereas environmental factors such as temperature and daylight, as well as duration and frequency of bouts of exercise, were more heavily weighted in the ideographic models. "
7915,2,The nomothetic recurrent neural network model was the highest performing nomothetic model and yielded 72% accuracy for an 80%/20% train/test split. 
7916,2,"Using the same 80/20 split, the ideographic models yielded 75% accuracy. "
7917,2,"However, restricting ideographic models to participants with more than 50 valid days in the training set, with the same 80/20 split, yielded 85% accuracy."
7918,3,"We conclude that for some applications, nomothetic models may be useful for yielding higher initial performance while still surfacing personalized predictors of stress, before switching to ideographic models upon sufficient data collection."
7919,4,Offline Digital Education for Medical Students: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis by the Digital Health Education Collaboration
7920,0,"Medical schools in low-and middle-income countries are facing a shortage of staff, limited infrastructure, and restricted access to fast and reliable internet. "
7921,0,"Offline digital education may be an alternative solution for these issues, allowing medical students to learn at their own time and pace, without the need for a network connection."
7922,1,We carried out a systematic review of the literature by following the Cochrane methodology. 
7923,1,We searched seven major electronic databases from January 1990 to August 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster RCTs. 
7924,1,"Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. "
7925,1,"We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations criteria."
7926,2,"We included 36 studies with 3325 medical students, of which 33 were RCTs and three were cluster RCTs. "
7927,2,"The interventions consisted of software programs, CD-ROMs, PowerPoint presentations, computer-based videos, and other computer-based interventions. "
7928,2,"The pooled estimate of 19 studies (1717 participants) showed no significant difference between offline digital education and traditional learning groups in terms of students' postintervention knowledge scores (standardized mean difference=0.11, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.32; small effect size; low-quality evidence). "
7929,2,"Meta-analysis of four studies found that, compared with traditional learning, offline digital education improved medical students' postintervention skills (standardized mean difference=1.05, 95% CI 0.15-1.95; large effect size; low-quality evidence). "
7930,2,We are uncertain about the effects of offline digital education on students' attitudes and satisfaction due to missing or incomplete outcome data. 
7931,2,"Only four studies estimated the costs of offline digital education, and none reported changes in accessibility or availability of such education or in the adverse effects. "
7932,2,The risk of bias was predominantly high in more than half of the included studies. 
7933,2,"The overall quality of the evidence was low (for knowledge, skills, attitudes, and satisfaction) due to the study limitations and inconsistency across the studies."
7934,3,Our findings suggest that offline digital education is as effective as traditional learning in terms of medical students' knowledge and may be more effective than traditional learning in terms of medical students' skills. 
7935,3,"However, there is a need to further investigate students' attitudes and satisfaction with offline digital education as well as its cost-effectiveness, changes in its accessibility or availability, and any resulting unintended/adverse effects."
7936,4,The Role of Frontline Leaders in Building Health Professional Support for a New Patient Portal: Survey Study
7937,0,Effective leadership and change management are thought to contribute to the successful implementation of health information technology innovations. 
7938,0,"However, limited attention has been paid to the role of frontline leaders in building health professional support for new technical innovations."
7939,1,Data were collected through an online survey of 2067 health professionals and 401 frontline leaders working in 44 units from 14 health organizations in Finland. 
7940,1,The participating organizations run a joint self-care and digital value services project developing a new patient portal for self-management. 
7941,1,The survey was conducted before the piloting and implementation of the patient portal.
7942,2,"The frontline leaders' perception of vision clarity had the strongest association with their own support for the portal (beta=.40, P<.001). "
7943,2,"Results also showed an association between leaders' view of organizational readiness and their support (ss=.15, P=.04). "
7944,2,"The leaders' positive perceptions of the quality of informing about the patient portal was associated with both leaders' own (beta=.16, P=.02) and subordinate health professionals' support for the portal (beta=.08, P<. "
7945,2,001). 
7946,2,"Furthermore, professional participation in the planning of the portal was positively associated with their support (beta=.57, P<.001)."
7947,3,"Findings suggest that assuring good informing, communicating a clear vision to frontline leaders, and acknowledging organizational readiness for change can increase health professional support for electronic health (eHealth) services in the pre-implementation phase. "
7948,3,Results highlight the role of frontline leaders in engaging professionals in the planning and implementation of eHealth services and in building health professionals' positive attitudes toward the implementation of eHealth services.
7949,4,Health-Related Internet Usage and Design Feature Preference for E-Mental Health Programs Among Men and Women
7950,0,Major depressive episodes (MDEs) are prevalent in the workplace and affect workers' health and productivity. 
7951,0,"Therefore, there is a pressing need for innovation in the prevention of MDEs in the workplace. "
7952,0,Electronic mental (e-mental) health programs are a cost-effective approach toward the self-management of stress and emotional issues. 
7953,0,"E-mental health dropout rate, MDE prevalence, and symptoms greatly vary by sex and age. "
7954,0,"Thus, the development and implementation of e-mental health programs for the prevention of MDEs need to be examined through a sex and age lens to enhance program use and effectiveness."
7955,1,Household residents across Canada were contacted using the random digit dialing method. 
7956,1,500 women and 511 men who were 18 years and older and who were at high risk of having MDEs were interviewed. 
7957,1,"Internet use was assessed using questions from the 2012 Canadian Internet Use Survey conducted by Statistics Canada, and preferred design features of e-mental health program questions were developed by the BroMatters team members. "
7958,1,The proportions of likely use of specific features of e-mental health programs in women were estimated and compared with those in men using chi-square tests. 
7959,1,The comparisons were made overall and by age groups.
7960,2,"Men (181/511, 35.4%) and women (211/500, 42.2%) differed significantly in their likelihood of using an e-mental health program. "
7961,2,"Compared with men (307/489, 62.8%), women (408/479, 85.2%) were more likely to use the internet for medical or health-related information. "
7962,2,"Women were more likely to use the following design features: practices and exercises to help reduce symptoms of stress and depression (350/500, 70.7%), a self-help interactive program that provides information about stress and work problems (302/500, 61.8%), the ability to ask questions and receive answers from mental health professionals via email or text message (294/500, 59.9%), and to receive printed materials by mail (215/500, 43.4%). "
7963,2,"Men preferred to receive information in a video game format (156/511, 30.7%). "
7964,2,"Younger men (46/73, 63%) and younger women (49/60, 81%) were more likely to access a program through a mobile phone or an app, and younger men preferred having access to information in a video game format."
7965,3,Factors such as sex and age influenced design feature preferences for an e-mental health program. 
7966,3,"Working women who are at high risk for MDEs preferred interactive programs incorporating practice and exercise for reducing stress, quality information about work stress, and some guidance from professionals. "
7967,3,This suggests that sex and age should be taken into account when designing e-mental health programs to meet the needs of individuals seeking help via Web-based mental health programs and to enhance their use.
7968,4,Digital Problem-Based Learning in Health Professions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis by the Digital Health Education Collaboration
7969,0,"The use of digital education in problem-based learning, or digital problem-based learning (DPBL), is increasingly employed in health professions education. "
7970,0,"DPBL includes purely digitally delivered as well as blended problem-based learning, wherein digital and face-to-face learning are combined."
7971,1,We used the gold-standard Cochrane methods to conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 
7972,1,"We included studies that compared the effectiveness of DPBL with traditional learning methods or other forms of digital education in improving health professionals' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and satisfaction. "
7973,1,"Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. "
7974,1,"We contacted study authors for additional information, if necessary. "
7975,1,We used the random-effects model in the meta-analyses.
7976,2,Nine RCTs involving 890 preregistration health professionals were included. 
7977,2,Digital technology was mostly employed for presentation of problems. 
7978,2,"In three studies, PBL was delivered fully online. "
7979,2,"Digital technology modalities spanned online learning, offline learning, virtual reality, and virtual patients. "
7980,2,The control groups consisted of traditional PBL and traditional learning. 
7981,2,"The pooled analysis of seven studies comparing the effect of DPBL and traditional PBL reported little or no difference in postintervention knowledge outcomes (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.19, 95% CI 0.00-0.38). "
7982,2,"The pooled analysis of three studies comparing the effect of DPBL to traditional learning on postintervention knowledge outcomes favored DPBL (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.14-1.19). "
7983,2,"For skill development, the pooled analysis of two studies comparing DPBL to traditional PBL favored DPBL (SMD 0.30, 95% CI 0.07-0.54). "
7984,2,Findings on attitudes and satisfaction outcomes were mixed. 
7985,2,The included studies mostly had an unclear risk of bias.
7986,3,Our findings suggest that DPBL is as effective as traditional PBL and more effective than traditional learning in improving knowledge. 
7987,3,DPBL may be more effective than traditional learning or traditional PBL in improving skills. 
7988,3,Further studies should evaluate the use of digital technology for the delivery of other PBL components as well as PBL overall.
7989,4,Patient-Level Prediction of Cardio-Cerebrovascular Events in Hypertension Using Nationwide Claims Data
7990,0,Prevention and management of chronic diseases are the main goals of national health maintenance programs. 
7991,0,"Previously widely used screening tools, such as Health Risk Appraisal, are restricted in their achievement this goal due to their limitations, such as static characteristics, accessibility, and generalizability. "
7992,0,"Hypertension is one of the most important chronic diseases requiring management via the nationwide health maintenance program, and health care providers should inform patients about their risks of a complication caused by hypertension."
7993,1,"We used a 12-year longitudinal dataset of the nationwide sample cohort, which contains the data of 514,866 patients and allows tracking of patients' medical history across all health care providers in Korea (N= 51,920). "
7994,1,"To ensure the generalizability of our models, we conducted an external validation using another national sample cohort dataset, comprising one million different patients, published by the National Health Insurance Service. "
7995,1,"From each dataset, we obtained the data of 74,535 and 59,738 patients with essential hypertension and developed machine learning models for predicting cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. "
7996,1,Six machine learning models were developed and compared for evaluating performances based on validation metrics.
7997,2,Machine learning algorithms enabled us to detect high-risk patients based on their medical history. 
7998,2,The long short-term memory-based algorithm outperformed in the within test (F1-score=. 
7999,2,"772, external test F1-score=. "
8000,2,"613), and the random forest-based algorithm of risk prediction showed better performance over other machine learning algorithms concerning generalization (within test F1-score=.757, external test F1-score=.705). "
8001,2,"Concerning the number of features, in the within test, the long short-term memory-based algorithms outperformed regardless of the number of features. "
8002,2,"However, in the external test, the random forest-based algorithm was the best, irrespective of the number of features it encountered."
8003,3,We developed and compared machine learning models predicting high-risk vascular diseases in hypertensive patients so that they may manage their blood pressure based on their risk level. 
8004,3,"By relying on the prediction model, a government can predict high-risk patients at the nationwide level and establish health care policies in advance."
8005,4,Evaluating Digital Maturity and Patient Acceptability of Real-Time Patient Experience Feedback Systems: Systematic Review
8006,0,One of the essential elements of a strategic approach to improving patients' experience is to measure and report on patients' experiences in real time. 
8007,0,"Real-time feedback (RTF) is increasingly being collected using digital technology; however, there are several factors that may influence the success of the digital system."
8008,1,"We systematically searched the following databases to identify papers that used digital systems to collect RTF: The Cochrane Library, Global Health, Health Management Information Consortium, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL. "
8009,1,"In addition, Google Scholar and gray literature were utilized. "
8010,1,"Studies were assessed on their digital maturity using a Digital Maturity Framework on the basis of the following 4 domains: capacity/resource, usage, interoperability, and impact. "
8011,1,A total score of 4 indicated the highest level of digital maturity.
8012,2,"RTF was collected primarily using touchscreens, tablets, and Web-based platforms. "
8013,2,Implementation of digital systems showed acceptable response rates and generally positive views from patients and staff. 
8014,2,Patient demographics according to RTF responses varied. 
8015,2,An overrepresentation existed in females with a white predominance and in patients aged >= 65 years. 
8016,2,"Of 13 eligible studies, none had digital systems that were deemed to be of the highest level of maturity. "
8017,2,"Three studies received a score of 3, 2, and 1, respectively. "
8018,2,Four studies scored 0 points. 
8019,2,"While 7 studies demonstrated capacity/resource, 8 demonstrated impact. "
8020,2,None of the studies demonstrated interoperability in their digital systems.
8021,3,"Patients and staff alike are willing to engage in RTF delivered using digital technology, thereby disrupting previous paper-based feedback. "
8022,3,"However, a lack of emphasis on digital maturity may lead to ineffective RTF, thwarting improvement efforts. "
8023,3,"Therefore, given the potential benefits of RTF, health care services should ensure that their digital systems deliver across the digital maturity continuum."
8024,1,The economic evaluation was performed alongside a single-blind parallel group randomized controlled trial. 
8025,1,"Participants were recruited via media, general practitioners, and mental health care institutions. "
8026,1,"In total, 288 remitted individuals with a history of recurrent depression were eligible, of whom 264 were randomly allocated to M-CT with minimal therapist support added to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. "
8027,1,"M-CT comprised 8 online lessons, and participants were advised to complete 1 lesson per week. "
8028,1,The economic evaluation was performed from a societal perspective with a 24-month time horizon. 
8029,1,"The health outcomes were number of depression-free days according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, (DSM-IV) criteria assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I disorders by blinded interviewers after 3, 12, and 24 months. "
8030,1,Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were self-assessed with the three level version of the EuroQol Five Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L). 
8031,1,Costs were assessed with the Trimbos and Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Questionnaire on Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness (TiC-P). 
8032,1,Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated and cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were displayed to assess the probability that M-CT is cost effective compared to TAU.
8033,2,Mean total costs over 24 months were (sic)8298 (US $9415) for M-CT and (sic)7296 (US $8278) for TAU. 
8034,2,"No statistically significant differences were found between M-CT and TAU regarding depression-free days and QALYs (P=.37 and P=.92, respectively). "
8035,2,"The incremental costs were (sic)179 (US $203) per depression-free day and (sic)230,816 (US $261,875) per QALY. "
8036,2,"The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves suggested that for depression-free days, high investments have to be made to reach an acceptable probability that M-CT is cost effective compared to TAU. "
8037,2,"Regarding QALYs, considerable investments have to be made but the probability that M-CT is cost effective compared to TAU does not rise above 40%."
8038,3,The results suggest that adding M-CT to TAU is not effective and cost effective compared to TAU alone. 
8039,3,Adherence rates were similar to other studies and therefore do not explain this finding. 
8040,3,"The participants scarcely booked additional therapist support, resulting in 17.3 minutes of mean total therapist support. "
8041,3,More studies are needed to examine the cost effectiveness of internet-based interventions with respect to long-term outcomes and the role and optimal dosage of therapist support. 
8042,3,"Overall, more research is needed on scalable and cost-effective interventions that can reduce the burden of recurrent MDD."
8043,4,Associations of eHealth Literacy With Health Services Utilization Among College Students: Cross-Sectional Study
8044,0,Electronic health (eHealth) literacy has become an important topic in health fields. 
8045,0,Studies have found that individuals with higher eHealth literacy are more likely to use preventive care services and to have effective interactions with their physicians. 
8046,0,"In addition, previous studies have revealed a gender difference in the utilization of physician access and outpatient services. "
8047,0,"Nevertheless, few studies have explored the effect of the three levels of eHealth literacy (functional, interactive, and critical levels) on the four aspects of health services utilization (type, site, purpose, and time interval). "
8048,0,It is unclear whether the associations between these three levels of eHealth literacy and the four aspects of health services utilization among college students are positive or negative.
8049,1,"We used the eHealth Literacy Scale, a 12-item instrument designed to measure college students' functional, interactive, and critical eHealth literacy, and the Health Services Utilization Scale, which is a 10-item instrument developed to measure the four aspects of health services utilization by college students. "
8050,1,A nationally representative sample of 489 college students in Taiwan was surveyed. 
8051,1,"We conducted multiple regression analysis to examine the associations among gender, eHealth literacy, and health services utilization."
8052,2,"The study found that being female was negatively related to the purpose aspect of health services utilization (t(487)=-2.85, P<.01). "
8053,2,"However, the R-2 value of gender on the purpose aspect was low enough to be ignored. "
8054,2,"Critical (t(484)= 2.98-4.23, P<.01) and interactive eHealth literacy (t(484)= 2.43-2.89, P<.05) were related to three aspects of the health services utilization, and functional eHealth literacy was related to the purpose aspect (t(484)=-4.99, P<.001)."
8055,3,This study showed that Taiwanese college students with interactive eHealth literacy were more likely to have a higher rate of outpatient care use. 
8056,3,"Moreover, Taiwanese college students with critical eHealth literacy were more likely to make full use of health services than those with functional eHealth literacy. "
8057,3,"Finally, the educated and age-restricted sample may attenuate gender disparities in health services utilization among Taiwanese college students."
8058,4,Promoting Psychological Well-Being at Work by Reducing Stress and Improving Sleep: Mixed-Methods Analysis
8059,0,Workplace programs designed to improve the health and psychological well-being of employees are becoming increasingly popular. 
8060,0,"However, there are mixed reports regarding the effectiveness of such programs and little analysis of what helps people to engage with such programs."
8061,1,Participation in the Virgin Pulse Global Challenge program during May to September 2016 was studied. 
8062,1,"Self-reported stress, sleep quality, productivity, and psychological well-being data were collected both pre- and postprogram. "
8063,1,Participant experience data were collected through a third final survey. 
8064,1,"However, the response rates for the last 2 surveys were only 48% and 10%, respectively. "
8065,1,"A random forest was used to estimate the probability of the completion of the last 2 surveys based on the preprogram assessment data and the demographic data for the entire sample (N=178,350). "
8066,1,The inverse of these estimated probabilities were used as weights in hierarchical linear models in an attempt to address any estimation bias caused by the low response rates. 
8067,1,"These linear models described changes in psychological well-being, stress, sleep, and productivity over the duration of the program in relation to gender and age, engagement with each of the modules, each of the program features, and participant descriptions of the Virgin Pulse Global Challenge. "
8068,1,"A 0.1% significance level was used due to the large sample size for the final survey (N=18,653)."
8069,2,"The final analysis suggested that the program is more beneficial for older people, with 2.9% greater psychological well-being improvements observed on average in the case of women than men (P<.001). "
8070,2,"With one exception, all the program modules contributed significantly to the outcome measures with the following average improvements observed: psychological well-being, 4.1%-6.0%; quality of sleep, 3.2%-6.9%; work-related stress, 1.7%-6.8%; and productivity, 1.9%-4.2%. "
8071,2,"However, only 4 of the program features were found to have significant associations with the outcome measures with the following average improvements observed: psychological well-being, 3.7%-5.6%; quality of sleep, 3.4%-6.5%; work-related stress, 4.1%-6.4%; and productivity, 1.6%-3.2%. "
8072,2,"Finally, descriptions of the Virgin Pulse Global Challenge produced 5 text topics that were related to the outcome measures. "
8073,2,"Healthy lifestyle descriptions showed a positive association with outcomes, whereas physical activity and step count tracking descriptions showed a negative association with outcomes."
8074,3,The complementary use of qualitative and quantitative survey data in a mixed-methods analysis provided rich information that will inform the development of this and other programs designed to improve employee health. 
8075,3,"However, the low response rates and the lack of a control group are limitations, despite the attempts to address these problems in the analysis."
8076,4,How Users Experience and Use an eHealth Intervention Based on Self-Regulation: Mixed-Methods Study
8077,0,"eHealth interventions show stronger effects when informed by solid behavioral change theories; for example, self-regulation models supporting people in translating vague intentions to specific actions have shown to be effective in altering health behaviors. "
8078,0,"Although these theories inform developers about which behavioral change techniques should be included, they provide limited information about how these techniques can be engagingly implemented in Web-based interventions. "
8079,0,"Considering the high levels of attrition in eHealth, investigating users' experience about the implementation of behavior change techniques might be a fruitful avenue."
8080,1,"In this study, 20 adults from the general population used the intervention for 5 weeks. "
8081,1,"Users' website data were explored, and semistructured interviews with each of the users were performed. "
8082,1,A directed content analysis was performed using NVivo Software.
8083,2,"The techniques ""providing feedback on performance,"" ""action planning,"" and ""prompting review of behavioral goals"" were appreciated by users. "
8084,2,"However, the implementation of "" barrier identification/problem solving"" appeared to frustrate users; this was also reflected by the users' website data-many coping plans were of poor quality. "
8085,2,Most users were well aware of the benefits of adopting a more active way of living and stated not to have learned novel information. 
8086,2,"However, they appreciated the provided information because it reminded them about the importance of having an active lifestyle. "
8087,2,"Furthermore, prompting users to self-monitor their behavioral change was not sufficiently stimulating to make users actually monitor their behavior."
8088,3,Iteratively involving potential end users offers guidance to optimally adapt the implementation of various behavior change techniques to the target population. 
8089,3,We recommend creating short interventions with a straightforward layout that support users in creating and evaluating specific plans for action.
8090,4,Improving Consumer Understanding of Medical Text: Development and Validation of a New SubSimplify Algorithm to Automatically Generate Term Explanations in English and Spanish
8091,0,"While health literacy is important for people to maintain good health and manage diseases, medical educational texts are often written beyond the reading level of the average individual. "
8092,0,"To mitigate this disconnect, text simplification research provides methods to increase readability and, therefore, comprehension. "
8093,0,One method of text simplification is to isolate particularly difficult terms within a document and replace them with easier synonyms (lexical simplification) or an explanation in plain language (semantic simplification). 
8094,0,"Unfortunately, existing dictionaries are seldom complete, and consequently, resources for many difficult terms are unavailable. "
8095,0,This is the case for English and Spanish resources.
8096,1,SubSimplify uses word-level parsing techniques and specialized medical affix dictionaries to identify the morphological units of a term and then source their definitions. 
8097,1,"While the underlying resources are different, Sub Simplify applies the same principles in both languages. "
8098,1,"To evaluate our approach, we used term familiarity to identify difficult terms in English and Spanish and then generated explanations for them. "
8099,1,"For each language, we extracted 400 difficult terms from two different article types (General and Medical topics) balanced for frequency. "
8100,1,"For English terms, we compared SubSimplify's explanation with the explanations from the Consumer Health Vocabulary, WordNet Synonyms and Summaries, as well as Word Embedding Vector (WEV) synonyms. "
8101,1,"For Spanish terms, we compared the explanation to WordNet Summaries and WEV Embedding synonyms. "
8102,1,"We evaluated quality, coverage, and usefulness for the simplification provided for each term. "
8103,1,Quality is the average score from two subject experts on a 1-4 Likert scale (two per language) for the synonyms or explanations provided by the source. 
8104,1,"Coverage is the number of terms for which a source could provide an explanation Usefulness is the same expert score, however, with a 0 assigned when no explanations or synonyms were available for a term."
8105,2,"SubSimplify resulted in quality scores of 1.64 for English (P<.001) and 1.49 for Spanish (P<.001), which were lower than those of existing resources (Consumer Health Vocabulary [CHV]= 2.81). "
8106,2,"However, in coverage, SubSimplify outperforms all existing written resources, increasing the coverage from 53.0% to 80.5% in English and from 20.8% to 90.8% in Spanish. "
8107,2,(P<.001). 
8108,2,"This result means that the usefulness score of Sub Simplify (1.32; (P<.001) is greater than that of most existing resources (eg, CHV = 0.169)."
8109,3,"Our approach is intended as an additional resource to existing, manually created resources. "
8110,3,"It greatly increases the number of difficult terms for which an easier alternative can be made available, resulting in greater actual usefulness."
8111,4,"Web-Based Physical Activity Intervention for Latina Adolescents: Feasibility, Acceptability, and Potential Efficacy of the Ninas Saludables Study"
8112,0,"Physical activity is markedly low in Latina adolescents, yet few physical activity interventions have been attempted in this population. "
8113,0,"Web-based interventions can incorporate theory-based components, be appealing to adolescents, and have potential for low-cost dissemination."
8114,1,"A total of 21 Latina adolescents (aged 12-18 years) who could read and write in English and were underactive (<90 min/week) participated in a 12-week, theory-informed Web-based physical activity intervention. "
8115,1,The intervention website was modified from a previous Web-based intervention for Latina adults. 
8116,1,Web content was individually tailored based on the responses to monthly questionnaires. 
8117,1,"Feasibility was measured by recruitment, retention, and adherence/ engagement, and acceptability was measured by satisfaction surveys. "
8118,1,Physical activity was measured at baseline and follow-up (12 weeks) using the 7-day physical activity recall (PAR) interview and accelerometers.
8119,2,"Baseline activity as measured by the 7-day PAR and accelerometers was 24.7 (SD 26.11) and 24.8 (SD 38.3) min/week, respectively. "
8120,2,"At 12 weeks, 19 participants (90%, 19/21) returned. "
8121,2,"Adherence and engagement with materials were low, but 72% (15/21) of the participants indicated that they were satisfied with the intervention. "
8122,2,Activity at 12 weeks increased by 58.8 (SD 11.33) min/week measured by the 7-day PAR (P<.001). 
8123,2,Accelerometer-measured activity did not increase. 
8124,2,"Activities reported at follow-up were more varied than at baseline, including some activities measured poorly by accelerometers (eg, biking and swimming). "
8125,2,Participants suggested simplifying the website and incorporating other technologies.
8126,3,Good retention and increases in self-reported activity suggest a promising approach to delivering a physical activity intervention to Latina adolescents. 
8127,3,"Incorporating other technologies, such as smartphone apps, could make the intervention more engaging, acceptable, and effective."
8128,4,Developing a Mental Health eClinic to Improve Access to and Quality of Mental Health Care for Young People: Using Participatory Design as Research Methodologies
8129,0,"Each year, many young Australians aged between 16 and 25 years experience a mental health disorder, yet only a small proportion access services and even fewer receive timely and evidence-based treatments. "
8130,0,"Today, with ever-increasing access to the Internet and use of technology, the potential to provide all young people with access (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) to the support they require to improve their mental health and well-being is promising."
8131,1,A research and development (R&D) cycle for the codesign and build of the Mental Health eClinic included several iterative PD phases: PD workshops; translation of knowledge and ideas generated during workshops to produce mockups of webpages either as hand-drawn sketches or as wireframes (simple layout of a webpage before visual design and content is added); rapid prototyping; and one-on-one consultations with end users to assess the usability of the alpha build of the Mental Health eClinic.
8132,2,"Four PD workshops were held with 28 end users (young people n=18, youth health professionals n=10) and our research team (n=8). "
8133,2,Each PD workshop was followed by a knowledge translation session. 
8134,2,"At the conclusion of this cycle, the alpha prototype was built, and one round of one-on-one end user consultation sessions was conducted (n=6; all new participants, young people n=4, youth health professionals n=2). "
8135,2,"The R&D cycle revealed the importance of five key components for the Mental Health eClinic: a home page with a visible triage system for those requiring urgent help; a comprehensive online physical and mental health assessment; a detailed dashboard of results; a booking and videoconferencing system to enable video visits; and the generation of a personalized well-being plan that includes links to evidence-based, and health professional-recommended, apps and etools."
8136,3,"The Mental Health eClinic provides health promotion, triage protocols, screening, assessment, a video visit system, the development of personalized well-being plans, and self-directed mental health support for young people. "
8137,3,It presents a technologically advanced and clinically efficient system that can be adapted to suit a variety of settings in which there is an opportunity to connect with young people. 
8138,3,"This will enable all young people, and especially those currently not able or willing to connect with face-to-face services, to receive best practice clinical services by breaking down traditional barriers to care and making health care more personalized, accessible, affordable, and available."
8139,4,Parents Experiences of Caring for Their Child at the Time of Discharge After Cardiac Surgery and During the Postdischarge Period: Qualitative Study Using an Online Forum
8140,0,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common class of birth defects, which encompasses a broad spectrum of severity ranging from relatively minor to extremely complex. "
8141,0,"Improvements in surgery and intensive care have resulted in an increasing number of infants with the most complex lesions surviving after surgery until the time of discharge from the hospital, but there remain concerns about out-of-hospital mortality, variability in how services are provided at the time of discharge and beyond, and difficulties experienced by some families in accessing care."
8142,1,"A closed online discussion group was set up via the main Facebook page of the Children's Heart Federation (CHF), a national charity offering support to children with heart disease and their families. "
8143,1,"The discussion group was advertised through the charity's webpage, and interested participants were directed to the charity's Facebook page from where they could access the closed Facebook group and respond to questions posted. "
8144,1,"The CHF moderated the forum, and the research team provided questions to be posted on the forum. "
8145,1,Responses were collated into a single transcript and subjected to thematic analysis.
8146,2,"The forum was open for 4 months, and 91 participants (mean age 35 years, range 23-58 years, 89 females, 89 parents, and 2 grandparents) submitted demographic information and were given access to the closed forum group. "
8147,2,"A common experience of isolation emerged from the data, with descriptions of how that isolation was experienced (physical, social, knowledge) and its psychological impact, together with the factors that made it worse or better. "
8148,2,Woven through this theme was the notion that parents developed expertise over time.
8149,3,The use of an online forum provided a means for eliciting data from a large number of parents regarding their experiences of caring for their child after hospital discharge following cardiac surgery. 
8150,3,"Parents engaged with the forum and were able to articulate what went well and what went less well, together with sharing their stories and supporting each other through doing so. "
8151,3,"Some parents clearly found participating in the forum a positive experience in itself, demonstrating the potential of social media as a mechanism for providing support and reducing isolation. "
8152,3,Information gained from the forum was used to shape questions for interviews with parents in a subsequent phase of the study. 
8153,3,"Furthermore, the themes identified in the online forum have contributed to identifying ways of improving the provision of care and support for parents of high-risk babies following discharge after cardiac surgery."
8154,4,"A Single-Session, Web-Based Parenting Intervention to Prevent Adolescent Depression and Anxiety Disorders: Randomized Controlled Trial"
8155,0,"Depression and anxiety disorders are significant contributors to burden of disease in young people, highlighting the need to focus preventive efforts early in life. "
8156,0,"Despite substantial evidence for the role of parents in the prevention of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders, there remains a need for translation of this evidence into preventive parenting interventions. "
8157,0,"To address this gap, we developed a single-session, Web-based, tailored psychoeducation intervention that aims to improve parenting practices known to influence the development of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders."
8158,1,"We conducted a single-blind, parallel group, superiority randomized controlled trial comparing the intervention with a 3-month waitlist control. "
8159,1,The intervention is fully automated and consists of two components: (1) completion of an online self-assessment of current parenting practices against evidence-based parenting recommendations for the prevention of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders and (2) an individually tailored feedback report highlighting each parent's strengths and areas for improvement based on responses to the self-assessment. 
8160,1,"A community sample of 349 parents, together with 327 adolescents (aged 12-15 years), were randomized to either the intervention or waitlist control condition. "
8161,1,"Parents and adolescents completed online self-reported assessments of parenting and adolescent symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline, 1-month (parent-report of parenting only), and 3-month follow-up."
8162,2,"Compared with controls, intervention group parents showed significantly greater improvement in parenting risk and protective factors from baseline to 1-month and 3-month follow-up (F2,331.22=16.36, P<.001), with a small to medium effect size at 3-month follow-up (d=0.33). "
8163,2,There were no significant effects of the intervention on adolescent-report of parenting or symptoms of depression or anxiety in the adolescents (all P>.05).
8164,3,"Findings suggest that a single-session, individually tailored, Web-based parenting intervention can improve parenting factors that are known to influence the development of depression and anxiety in adolescents. "
8165,3,"However, our results do not support the effectiveness of the intervention in improving adolescent depression or anxiety symptoms in the short-term. "
8166,3,Long-term studies are required to adequately assess the relationship between improving parenting factors and adolescent depression and anxiety outcomes. 
8167,3,"Nonetheless, this is a promising avenue for the translation of research into a low-cost, sustainable, universal prevention approach."
8168,4,Multidisciplinary Collaboration in the Treatment of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes in Primary Care: Analysis Using Process Mining
8169,0,Public health in several countries is characterized by a shortage of professionals and a lack of economic resources. 
8170,0,"Monitoring and redesigning processes can foster the success of health care institutions, enabling them to provide a quality service while simultaneously reducing costs. "
8171,0,"Process mining, a discipline that extracts knowledge from information system data to analyze operational processes, affords an opportunity to understand health care processes."
8172,1,"This paper proposes a method based on the use of process mining to identify patterns of collaboration between physician, nurse, and dietitian in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to compare these patterns with the clinical evolution of the patients within the context of primary care. "
8173,1,"Clustering is used as part of the preprocessing of data to manage the variability, and then process mining is used to identify patterns that may arise."
8174,2,"The method is applied in three primary health care centers in Santiago, Chile. "
8175,2,"A total of seven collaboration patterns were identified, which differed primarily in terms of the number of disciplines present, the participation intensity of each discipline, and the referrals between disciplines. "
8176,2,The pattern in which the three disciplines participated in the most equitable and comprehensive manner had a lower proportion of highly decompensated patients compared with those patterns in which the three disciplines participated in an unbalanced manner.
8177,3,"By discovering which collaboration patterns lead to improved outcomes, health care centers can promote the most successful patterns among their professionals so as to improve the treatment of patients. "
8178,3,Process mining techniques are useful for discovering those collaborations patterns in flexible and unstructured health care processes.
8179,4,A Mobile App to Improve Self-Management of Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes: Qualitative Realist Evaluation
8180,0,The increasing use of Web-based solutions for health prevention and promotion presents opportunities to improve self-management and adherence to guideline-based therapy for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 
8181,0,"Despite promising preliminary evidence, many users stop using Web-based solutions due to the burden of data entry, hidden costs, loss of interest, and a lack of comprehensive features. "
8182,0,Evaluations tend to focus on effectiveness or impact and fail to evaluate the nuanced variables that may interact to contribute to outcome success (or failure).
8183,1,"A qualitative realist evaluation was conducted with one-on-one, semistructured telephonic interviews completed at baseline, and again toward the end of the intervention period (3 months). "
8184,1,"Topics included participants' experiences of using the Web-based solution, barriers and facilitators of self-management, and barriers and facilitators to effective use. "
8185,1,"Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis strategies, after which the key themes were used to develop statements of the relationships between the key contextual factors, mechanisms of action, and impact on the primary outcome (glycated hemoglobin, HbA(1c))."
8186,2,"Twenty-six interviews (14 baseline, 12 follow-up) were completed with 16 participants with T2DM, and the following 3 key groups emerged: the easiest fit, the best fit, and those who failed to activate. "
8187,2,"Self-efficacy and willingness to engage with the solution facilitated improvement in HbA(1c), whereas competing priorities and psychosocial issues created barriers to engagement. "
8188,2,"Individuals with high baseline self-efficacy who were motivated, took ownership for their actions, and prioritized diabetes management were early and eager adopters of the app and recorded improvements in HbA(1c) over the intervention period. "
8189,2,"Individuals with moderate baseline self-efficacy and no competing priorities, who identified gaps in understanding of how their actions influence their health, were slow to adopt use but recorded the greatest improvements in HbA(1c). "
8190,2,The final group had low baseline self-efficacy and identified a range of psychosocial issues and competing priorities. 
8191,2,"These participants were uncertain of the benefits of using a Web-based solution to support self-management, ultimately resulting in minimal engagement and no improvement in HbA(1c)."
8192,3,"Self-efficacy, competing priorities, previous behavior change, and beliefs about Web-based solutions interact to determine engagement and impact on the clinical outcomes. "
8193,3,Considering the balance of these patient characteristics is likely to help health care providers identify individuals who are apt to benefit from a Web-based solution to support self-management of T2DM. 
8194,3,Web-based solutions could be modified to incorporate the existing screening measures to identify individuals who are at risk of suboptimal adherence to inform the provision of additional support(s) as needed.
8195,4,Pregnant Women Sharing Pregnancy-Related Information on Facebook: Web-Based Survey Study
8196,0,"Research indicates expectant and new mothers use the Internet, specifically social media, to gain information and support during the transition to parenthood. "
8197,0,"Although parents regularly share information about and photos of their child or children on Facebook, researchers have neither explored the use of Facebook to share pregnancy-related information nor investigated factors that influence such sharing."
8198,1,Pregnant women who were at least 18 years of age were recruited for participation in the study through posts and paid advertisements on Facebook and posts to professional organization listservs. 
8199,1,Individuals interested in participating were directed to a secure Web-based survey system where they completed the consent form and the survey that focused on their current pregnancy. 
8200,1,"Participants completed the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale and answered questions that assessed how often they shared pregnancy-related information on Facebook, who they shared it with, why they shared it, and what they shared."
8201,2,A total of 117 pregnant women completed the survey. 
8202,2,"Descriptive statistics indicated that the pregnancy announcement was most commonly shared (75/108, 69.4%), with most women sharing pregnancy-related information on Facebook less than monthly (52/117, 44.4%) with only family and friends (90/116, 77.6% and 91/116, 78.4%, respectively) and for the purpose of involving others or sharing the experience (62/107, 57.9%). "
8203,2,"Correlation and regression analyses showed that prenatal attachment, in general, was positively and significantly related to all aspects of sharing pregnancy-related information at the P<.05 level, with the exception of sharing because of expectations. "
8204,2,"Quality of attachment, which involves the positive feelings the woman has about her unborn child, was significantly associated with sharing to involve others or share the pregnancy (t(8),(93)= 2.654, P=.009). "
8205,2,"In contrast, after controlling for other variables, the strength or preoccupation component of prenatal attachment was significantly associated with frequency of sharing (t(8,100)=2.554, P=.01), number to types of information shared (t(8,97)=2.605, P=.01), number of groups with whom shared (t(8,99)=3.467, P=.001), and sharing to get advice (chi(2)(8)=5.339, P=.02)."
8206,3,"Pregnant women in this study used Facebook for a variety of reasons, demonstrating the use of the social media platform during pregnancy for supportive and informational purposes. "
8207,3,"Overall, the results of this study are likely to be useful to professionals who are seeking alternative methods for providing intervention, information, and support to pregnant women via social media in our technology-driven society."
8208,4,Evaluating a Web-Based Social Anxiety Intervention Among University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial
8209,0,"Treatment rates for social anxiety, a prevalent and potentially debilitating condition, remain among the lowest of all major mental disorders today. "
8210,0,"Although computer-delivered interventions are well poised to surmount key barriers to the treatment of social anxiety, most are only marginally effective when delivered as stand-alone treatments. "
8211,0,"A new, Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention called Overcome Social Anxiety was recently created to address the limitations of prior computer-delivered interventions. "
8212,0,Users of Overcome Social Anxiety are self-directed through various CBT modules incorporating cognitive restructuring and behavioral experiments. 
8213,0,"The intervention is personalized to each user's symptoms, and automatic email reminders and time limits are used to encourage adherence."
8214,1,"Following eligibility screening, participants were randomly assigned to a treatment condition or a wait-list control condition. "
8215,1,Only those assigned to the treatment condition were given access to Overcome Social Anxiety; they were asked to complete the program within 4 months. 
8216,1,"The social interaction anxiety scale (SIAS), the fear of negative evaluation scale (FNE), and the quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire-short form (Q-LES-Q-SF) were administered to participants from both conditions during baseline and 4-month follow-up lab visits."
8217,2,"Over the course of the study, participants assigned to the treatment condition experienced a significant reduction in social anxiety (SIAS: P<.001, Cohen d=0.72; FNE: P<.001, Cohen d=0.82), whereas those assigned to the control condition did not (SIAS: P=.13, Cohen d=0.26 ;FNE: P=.40, Cohen d=0.14).Additionally, a direct comparison of the average change in social anxiety in the 2 conditions over the course of the study showed that those assigned to the treatment condition experienced significantly more improvement than those assigned to the control condition (SIAS: P=.03, Cohen d=0.56; FNE: P=.001, Cohen d=0.97). "
8218,2,"Although participants assigned to the treatment condition experienced a slight increase in life satisfaction, as measured by Q-LES-Q-SF scores, and those assigned to the control condition experienced a slight decrease, these changes were not statistically significant (treatment: P=.35, Cohen d=-0.18; control: P=.30, Cohen d=0.18)."
8219,3,Our findings indicate that Overcome Social Anxiety is an effective intervention for treating symptoms of social anxiety and that it may have further utility in serving as a model for the development of new interventions. 
8220,3,"Additionally, our findings provide evidence that contemporary Web-based interventions can be sophisticated enough to benefit users even when delivered as stand-alone treatments, suggesting that further opportunities likely exist for the development of other Web-based mental health interventions."
8221,4,Perceived Threat and Internet Use Predict Intentions to Get Bowel Cancer Screening (Colonoscopy): Longitudinal Questionnaire Study
8222,0,"Many people use the Internet for health-related information search, which is known to help regulate their emotional state. "
8223,0,"However, not much is known yet about how Web-based information search together with negative emotional states (ie, threat of cancer diagnosis) relate to preventive medical treatment decisions (ie, colonoscopy intentions)."
8224,1,A longitudinal questionnaire study was conducted among healthy participants who were approaching or just entering the bowel cancer risk group (aged 45-55 years). 
8225,1,"Perceived threat of a possible (bowel) cancer diagnosis, frequency of health-related Internet use, and intentions to have a colonoscopy were assessed at 2 time points (6-month time lag between the 2 measurement points T1 and T2). "
8226,1,Multiple regression analyses were conducted to test whether threat and Internet use at T1 together predicted colonoscopy intentions at T2.
8227,2,"In line with our predictions, we found that the threat of a possible (bowel) cancer diagnosis interacted with the frequency of Internet use (both T1) to predict colonoscopy intentions (T2; B=.23, standard error [SE]=0.09, P=.01). "
8228,2,"For people who used the Internet relatively often (+1 SD), the positive relationship between threat and colonoscopy intentions was significantly stronger (B=.56, SE=0.15, P<.001) compared with participants who used the Internet less often (-1 SD; B=.17, SE=0.09, P=.07). "
8229,2,"This relationship was unique to Web-based (vs other types of) information search and independent of risk factors (eg, body mass index [BMI] and smoking)."
8230,3,The results of this study suggest that health-related Internet use can facilitate emotion-regulatory processes. 
8231,3,"People who feel threatened by a possible (bowel) cancer diagnosis reported stronger colonoscopy intentions, especially when they used the Internet often. "
8232,3,We propose that this is because people who experience threat are more likely to search for and process information that allows them to downregulate their aversive emotional state. 
8233,3,"In the present case of (bowel) cancer prevention, the most effective way to reduce threat is to get screened."
8234,4,"Reported Theory Use by Digital Interventions for Hazardous and Harmful Alcohol Consumption, and Association With Effectiveness: Meta-Regression"
8235,0,"Applying theory to the design and evaluation of interventions is likely to increase effectiveness and improve the evidence base from which future interventions are developed, though few interventions report this."
8236,1,Randomized controlled trials were extracted from a Cochrane review on digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption. 
8237,1,Reporting of theory use within these digital interventions was investigated using the theory coding scheme (TCS). 
8238,1,Reported theory use was analyzed by frequency counts and descriptive statistics. 
8239,1,Associations were analyzed with meta-regression models.
8240,2,"Of 41 trials involving 42 comparisons, half did not mention theory (50% [21/42]), and only 38% (16/42) used theory to select or develop the intervention techniques. "
8241,2,"Significant heterogeneity existed between studies in the effect of interventions on alcohol reduction (I-2=77.6%, P<.001). "
8242,2,"No significant associations were detected between reporting of theory use and intervention effectiveness in unadjusted models, though the meta-regression was underpowered to detect modest associations."
8243,3,"Digital interventions offer a unique opportunity to refine and develop new dynamic, temporally sensitive theories, yet none of the studies reported refining or developing theory. "
8244,3,"Clearer selection, application, and reporting of theory use is needed to accurately assess how useful theory is in this field and to advance the field of behavior change theories."
8245,4,Relationship Between State-Level Google Online Search Volume and Cancer Incidence in the United States: Retrospective Study
8246,0,"In the United States, cancer is common, with high morbidity and mortality; cancer incidence varies between states. "
8247,0,"Online searches reflect public awareness, which could be driven by the underlying regional cancer epidemiology."
8248,1,"We performed a population-based, retrospective study of state-level cancer incidence from 2004 through 2013 reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for breast, prostate, colon, lung, and uterine cancers and leukemia compared to Google Trends (GT) relative search volume (RSV), a metric designed by Google to allow interest in search topics to be compared between regions. "
8249,1,Participants included persons in the United States who searched for cancer terms on Google. 
8250,1,The primary measures were the correlation between annual state-level cancer incidence and RSV as determined by Spearman correlation and linear regression with RSV and year as independent variables and cancer incidence as the dependent variable. 
8251,1,Temporal associations between search activity and events raising public awareness such as cancer awareness months and cancer-related celebrity news were described.
8252,2,"At the state level, RSV was significantly correlated to incidence for breast (r=.18, P=.001), prostate (r=.27, P<.001), lung (r=.33, P<.001), and uterine cancers (r=.39, P<.001) and leukemia (r=.13, P=.003) but not colon cancer (r=.02, P=.66). "
8253,2,"After adjusting for time, state-level RSV was positively correlated to cancer incidence for all cancers: breast (P<.001, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.19), prostate (P=.38, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.22), lung (P<.001, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.46), colon (P<.001, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.17), and uterine cancers (P<.001, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.12) and leukemia (P<.001, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.03). "
8254,2,Temporal associations in GT were noted with breast cancer awareness month but not with other cancer awareness months and celebrity events.
8255,3,Cancer incidence is correlated with online search volume at the state level. 
8256,3,Search patterns were temporally associated with cancer awareness months and celebrity announcements. 
8257,3,Online searches reflect public awareness. 
8258,3,"Advancing understanding of online search patterns could augment traditional epidemiologic surveillance, provide opportunities for targeted patient engagement, and allow public information campaigns to be evaluated in ways previously unable to be measured."
8259,4,Preliminary Evidence for the Emergence of a Health Care Online Community of Practice: Using a Netnographic Framework for Twitter Hashtag Analytics
8260,0,Online communities of practice (oCoPs) may emerge from interactions on social media. 
8261,0,"These communities offer an open digital space and flat role hierarchy for information sharing and provide a strong group identity, rapid flow of information, content curation, and knowledge translation. "
8262,0,"To date, there is only a small body of evidence in medicine or health care to verify the existence of an oCoP."
8263,1,We examined social media activity in Twitter by analyzing the network centrality metrics of tweets with the #FOAMed hashtag and compared them with previously validated criteria of a community of practice (CoP).
8264,2,"The centrality analytics of the FOAM community showed concordance with aspects of a general CoP (in terms of community, domain, and practice), as well as some specific traits of a health care community, including social control, common purpose, flat hierarchy, and network-based and concrete achievement."
8265,3,This study demonstrated preliminary evidence of an oCoP focused on education and based on social media interactions. 
8266,3,Further examination of the topology of the network is needed to definitely prove the existence of an oCoP. 
8267,3,"Given that these communities result in significant knowledge translation and practice change, further research in this area appears warranted."
8268,4,Classifying Chinese Questions Related to Health Care Posted by Consumers Via the Internet
8269,0,"In question answering (QA) system development, question classification is crucial for identifying information needs and improving the accuracy of returned answers. "
8270,0,"Although the questions are domain-specific, they are asked by non-professionals, making the question classification task more challenging."
8271,1,A topic-based classification schema for health-related questions was built by manually annotating randomly selected questions. 
8272,1,The Kappa statistic was used to measure the interrater reliability of multiple annotation results. 
8273,1,"Using the above corpus, we developed a machine-learning method to automatically classify these questions into one of the following six classes: Condition Management, Healthy Lifestyle, Diagnosis, Health Provider Choice, Treatment, and Epidemiology."
8274,2,"The consumer health question schema was developed with a four-hierarchical-level of specificity, comprising 48 quaternary categories and 35 annotation rules. "
8275,2,The 2000 sample questions were coded with 2000 major codes and 607 minor codes. 
8276,2,"Using natural language processing techniques, we expressed the Chinese questions as a set of lexical, grammatical, and semantic features. "
8277,2,"Furthermore, the effective features were selected to improve the question classification performance. "
8278,2,"From the 6-category classification results, we achieved an average precision of 91.41%, recall of 89.62%, and F-1 score of 90.24%."
8279,3,"In this study, we developed an automatic method to classify questions related to Chinese health care posted by the general public. "
8280,3,It enables Artificial Intelligence ( AI) agents to understand Internet users' information needs on health care.
8281,4,Web-Based Interventions for Weight Loss or Weight Loss Maintenance in Overweight and Obese People: A Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews
8282,0,Weight loss is challenging and maintenance of weight loss is problematic. 
8283,0,Web-based programs offer good potential for delivery of interventions for weight loss or weight loss maintenance. 
8284,0,"However, the precise impact of Web-based weight management programs is still unclear."
8285,1,Electronic databases were searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses that included at least one study investigating the effect of a Web-based intervention on weight loss and/or weight loss maintenance among samples of overweight and/or obese individuals. 
8286,1,Twenty identified reviews met the inclusion criteria. 
8287,1,The Revised Assessment of Multiple SysTemAtic Reviews (R-AMSTAR) was used to assess methodological quality of reviews. 
8288,1,All included reviews were of sufficient methodological quality (R-AMSTAR score >= 22). 
8289,1,Key methodological and outcome data were extracted from each review.
8290,2,Web-based interventions for both weight loss and weight loss maintenance were more effective than minimal or control conditions. 
8291,2,"However, when contrasted with comparable non-Web-based interventions, results were less consistent across reviews."
8292,3,"Overall, the efficacy of weight loss maintenance interventions was stronger than the efficacy of weight loss interventions, but further evidence is needed to more clearly understand the efficacy of both types of Web-based interventions."
8293,4,Mental Health Mobile Apps for Preadolescents and Adolescents: A Systematic Review
8294,0,There are an increasing number of mobile apps available for adolescents with mental health problems and an increasing interest in assimilating mobile health (mHealth) into mental health services. 
8295,0,"Despite the growing number of apps available, the evidence base for their efficacy is unclear."
8296,1,"The following were systematically searched for relevant publications between January 2008 and July 2016: APA PsychNet, ACM Digital Library, Cochrane Library, Community Care Inform-Children, EMBASE, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Social Policy and Practice, Web of Science, Journal of Medical Internet Research, Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking, and OpenGrey. "
8297,1,"Abstracts were included if they described mental health apps (targeting depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, self-harm, suicide prevention, conduct disorder, eating disorders and body image issues, schizophrenia, psychosis, and insomnia) for mobile devices and for use by adolescents younger than 18 years."
8298,2,A total of 24 publications met the inclusion criteria. 
8299,2,"These described 15 apps, two of which were available to download. "
8300,2,Two small randomized trials and one case study failed to demonstrate a significant effect of three apps on intended mental health outcomes. 
8301,2,Articles that analyzed the content of six apps for children and adolescents that were available to download established that none had undergone any research evaluation. 
8302,2,Feasibility outcomes suggest acceptability of apps was good and app usage was moderate.
8303,3,"Overall, there is currently insufficient research evidence to support the effectiveness of apps for children, preadolescents, and adolescents with mental health problems. "
8304,3,"Given the number and pace at which mHealth apps are being released on app stores, methodologically robust research studies evaluating their safety, efficacy, and effectiveness is promptly needed."
8305,1,"Text mining methods using the Twitter Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) and Twitter Search API were used to collect and organize tweets from the hashtag #WhyWeTweetMH, circulated between September 2015 and November 2015. "
8306,1,Tweets were analyzed thematically to understand the key reasons for discussing mental health using the Twitter platform.
8307,2,Four overarching themes were derived from the 132 tweets collected: (1) sense of community; (2) raising awareness and combatting stigma; (3) safe space for expression; and (4) coping and empowerment. 
8308,2,"In addition, 11 associated subthemes were also identified."
8309,3,The themes derived from the content of the tweets highlight the perceived therapeutic benefits of Twitter through the provision of support and information and the potential for self-management strategies. 
8310,3,The ability to use Twitter to combat stigma and raise awareness of mental health problems indicates the societal benefits that can be facilitated via the platform. 
8311,3,The number of tweets and themes identified demonstrates the feasibility of implementing study-specific hashtags to explore research questions in the field of mental health and can be used as a basis for other health-related research.
8312,4,Assessing the Quality of Mobile Exercise Apps Based on the American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines: A Reliable and Valid Scoring Instrument
8313,0,"Regular physical activity can not only help with weight management, but also lower cardiovascular risks, cancer rates, and chronic disease burden. "
8314,0,"Yet, only approximately 20% of Americans currently meet the physical activity guidelines recommended by the US Department of Health and Human Services. "
8315,0,"With the rapid development of mobile technologies, mobile apps have the potential to improve participation rates in exercise programs, particularly if they are evidence-based and are of sufficient content quality."
8316,1,We conducted two focus groups (N=14) to elicit input for developing a preliminary 27-item scoring instruments based on the ACSM exercise prescription guidelines. 
8317,1,Three reviewers who were no sports medicine experts independently scored 28 exercise program apps using the instrument. 
8318,1,Inter- and intra-rater reliability was assessed among the 3 reviewers. 
8319,1,"An expert reviewer, a Fellow of the ACSM, also scored the 28 apps to create criterion scores. "
8320,1,Criterion validity was assessed by comparing nonexpert reviewers' scores to the criterion scores.
8321,2,"Overall, inter-and intra-rater reliability was high with most coefficients being greater than .7. "
8322,2,"Inter-rater reliability coefficients ranged from .59 to.99, and intra-rater reliability coefficients ranged from .47 to 1.00. "
8323,2,All reliability coefficients were statistically significant. 
8324,2,"Criterion validity was found to be excellent, with the weighted kappa statistics ranging from .67 to.99, indicating a substantial agreement between the scores of expert and nonexpert reviewers. "
8325,2,"Finally, all apps scored poorly against the ACSM exercise prescription guidelines. "
8326,2,"None of the apps received a score greater than 35, out of a possible maximal score of 70."
8327,3,We have developed and presented valid and reliable scoring instruments for exercise program apps. 
8328,3,"Our instrument may be useful for consumers and health care providers who are looking for apps that provide safe, progressive general exercise programs for health and fitness."
8329,4,The Effect of the General Data Protection Regulation on Medical Research
8330,0,The enactment of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will impact on European data science. 
8331,0,Particular concerns relating to consent requirements that would severely restrict medical data research have been raised.
8332,1,Analysis of ethicolegal requirements imposed by the GDPR.
8333,2,"The GDPR makes the classification of pseudonymised data as personal data clearer, although it has not been entirely resolved. "
8334,2,Biomedical research on personal data where consent has not been obtained must be of substantial public interest.
8335,3,The GDPR introduces protections for data subjects that aim for consistency across the EU. 
8336,3,The proposed changes will make little impact on biomedical data research.
8337,4,A Web-Based Physical Activity Intervention for Spanish-Speaking Latinas: A Costs and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
8338,0,Latinas report particularly low levels of physical activity and suffer from greater rates of lifestyle-related conditions such as obesity and diabetes. 
8339,0,"Interventions are needed that can increase physical activity in this growing population in a large-scale, cost-effective manner. "
8340,0,Web-based interventions may have potential given the increase in Internet use among Latinas and the scalability of Web-based programs.
8341,1,"Healthy adult Latina women (N=205) were recruited from the community and randomly assigned to receive a Spanish-language, Web-based, individually tailored physical activity intervention (intervention group) or were given access to a website with content on wellness topics other than physical activity (control group). "
8342,1,"Physical activity was measured using the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall interview and ActiGraph accelerometers at baseline, 6 months (ie, postintervention), and 12 months (ie, maintenance phase). "
8343,1,"Costs were estimated from a payer perspective and included all features necessary to implement the intervention in a community setting, including staff time (ie, wages, benefits, and overhead), materials, hardware, website hosting, and routine website maintenance."
8344,2,"At 6 months, the costs of running the intervention and control groups were US $17 and US $8 per person per month, respectively. "
8345,2,"These costs fell to US $12 and US $6 per person per month at 12 months, respectively. "
8346,2,Linear interpolation showed that intervention participants increased their physical activity by 1362 total minutes at 6 months (523 minutes by accelerometer) compared to 715 minutes for control participants (186 minutes by accelerometer). 
8347,2,"At 6 months, each minute increase in physical activity for the intervention group cost US $0.08 (US $0.20 by accelerometer) compared to US $0.07 for control participants (US $0.26 by accelerometer). "
8348,2,"Incremental cost-per-minute increases associated with the intervention were US $0.08 at 6 months and US $0.04 at 12 months (US $0.16 and US $0.08 by accelerometer, respectively). "
8349,2,Sensitivity analyses showed variations in staffing costs or intervention effectiveness yielded only modest changes in incremental costs.
8350,3,"While the Web-based physical activity intervention was more expensive than the wellness control, both were quite low cost compared to face-to-face or mail-delivered interventions. "
8351,3,Cost-effectiveness ranged markedly based on physical activity measure and was similar between the two conditions. 
8352,3,"Overall, the Web-based intervention was effective and low cost, suggesting a promising channel for increasing physical activity on a large scale in this at-risk population."
8353,4,Patient Use of Electronic Prescription Refill and Secure Messaging and Its Association With Undetectable HIV Viral Load: A Retrospective Cohort Study
8354,0,Electronic personal health records (PHRs) can support patient self-management of chronic conditions. 
8355,0,"Managing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load, through taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial to long term survival of persons with HIV. "
8356,0,Many persons with HIV have difficulty adhering to their ART over long periods of time. 
8357,0,PHRs contribute to chronic disease self-care and may help persons with HIV remain adherent to ART. 
8358,0,"Proportionally veterans with HIV are among the most active users of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) PHR, called My HealtheVet. "
8359,0,Little is known about whether the use of the PHR is associated with improved HIV outcomes in this population.
8360,1,We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the VA's electronic health record (EHR) and the PHR. 
8361,1,We identified veterans in VA care from 2009-2012 who had HIV and who used the PHR. 
8362,1,"We examined which ones had achieved the positive outcome of suppressed HIV viral load, and whether achievement of this outcome was associated with electronic prescription refill or SM. "
8363,1,"From 18,913 veterans with HIV, there were 3374 who both had a detectable viral load in 2009 and who had had a follow-up viral load test in 2012. "
8364,1,"To assess relationships between electronic prescription refill and viral control, and SM and viral control, we fit a series of multivariable generalized estimating equation models, accounting for clustering in VA facilities. "
8365,1,We adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics associated with portal use. 
8366,1,"In the initial models, the predictor variables were included in dichotomous format. "
8367,1,"Subsequently, to evaluate a potential dose-effect, the predictor variables were included as ordinal variables."
8368,2,"Among our sample of 3374 veterans with HIV who received VA care from 2009-2012, those who had transitioned from detectable HIV viral load in 2009 to undetectable viral load in 2012 tended to be older (P=.004), more likely to be white (P<.001), and less likely to have a substance use disorder, problem alcohol use, or psychosis (P=.006, P=.03, P=.004, respectively). "
8369,2,"There was a statistically significant positive association between use of electronic prescription refill and change in HIV viral load status from 2009-2012, from detectable to undetectable (OR 1.36, CI 1.11-1.66). "
8370,2,"There was a similar association between SM use and viral load status, but without achieving statistical significance (OR 1.28, CI 0.89-1.85). "
8371,2,Analyses did not demonstrate a dose-response of prescription refill or SM use for change in viral load.
8372,3,"PHR use, specifically use of electronic prescription refill, was associated with greater control of HIV. "
8373,3,Additional studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which this may be occurring.
8374,4,Applying Multiple Data Collection Tools to Quantify Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Communication on Twitter
8375,0,Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. 
8376,0,There are several vaccines that protect against strains of HPV most associated with cervical and other cancers. 
8377,0,"Thus, HPV vaccination has become an important component of adolescent preventive health care. "
8378,0,"As media evolves, more information about HPV vaccination is shifting to social media platforms such as Twitter. "
8379,0,"Health information consumed on social media may be especially influential for segments of society such as younger populations, as well as ethnic and racial minorities."
8380,1,"We collected Twitter data using 10 keywords related to HPV vaccination from August 1, 2014 to July 31, 2015. "
8381,1,Prospective data collection used the Twitter Search API and retrospective data collection used Twitter Firehose. 
8382,1,"Using a codebook to characterize tweet sentiment and content, we coded a subsample of tweets by hand to develop classification models to code the entire sample using machine learning procedures. "
8383,1,We also documented the words in the 140-character tweet text most associated with each keyword. 
8384,1,"We used chi-square tests, analysis of variance, and nonparametric equality of medians to test for significant differences in tweet characteristic by sentiment."
8385,2,"A total of 193,379 English-language tweets were collected, classified, and analyzed. "
8386,2,"Associated words varied with each keyword, with more positive and preventive words associated with ""HPV vaccine"" and more negative words associated with name-brand vaccines. "
8387,2,"Positive sentiment was the largest type of sentiment in the sample, with 75,393 positive tweets (38.99% of the sample), followed by negative sentiment with 48,940 tweets (25.31% of the sample). "
8388,2,"Positive and neutral tweets constituted the largest percentage of tweets mentioning prevention or protection (20,425/75,393, 27.09% and 6477/25,110, 25.79%, respectively), compared with only 11.5% of negative tweets (5647/48,940; P<.001). "
8389,2,"Nearly one-half (22,726/48,940, 46.44%) of negative tweets mentioned side effects, compared with only 17.14% (12,921/75,393) of positive tweets and 15.08% of neutral tweets (3787/25,110; P<.001)."
8390,3,"Examining social media to detect health trends, as well as to communicate important health information, is a growing area of research in public health. "
8391,3,Understanding the content and implications of conversations that form around HPV vaccination on social media can aid health organizations and health-focused Twitter users in creating a meaningful exchange of ideas and in having a significant impact on vaccine uptake. 
8392,3,"This area of research is inherently interdisciplinary, and this study supports this movement by applying public health, health communication, and data science approaches to extend methodologies across fields."
8393,4,Program Use and Outcome Change in a Web-Based Trauma Intervention: Individual and Social Factors
8394,0,Insight into user adherence to Web-based intervention programs and into its relationship to intervention effect is needed.
8395,1,"The sample consisted of 56 urban survivors of different trauma types and 90 rural survivors of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, who used the CMTR in 1 month on their own or guided by volunteers in a counseling center. "
8396,1,"Predictors were demographics (sex, age, highest education, marital status, and annual family income), health problems (trauma duration, posttraumatic symptoms, and depression), psychological factors (coping self-efficacy), and social factors (social functioning impairment and social support). "
8397,1,"Program use was assessed by general program usage (eg, number of visiting days) and program adherence (eg, webpages completed in modules). "
8398,1,"Outcome measures were the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Symptom Checklist 90-Depression (SCL-D), Trauma Coping Self-Efficacy scale (CSE), Crisis Support Scale (CSS), and Social Functioning Impairment questionnaire (SFI) adopted from the CMTR."
8399,2,"(1) Program use: rural participants had a larger total number of visiting days (F-1,F-144=40.50, P<.001) and visited more program modules in 1 month (chi(2)(3)=73.67, P<.001) than urban participants. "
8400,2,"(2) Predictors and program use: total number of visiting days was correlated with CSS at pretest (r=.22, P=.009), and total number of completed webpages was associated with SFI at pretest (r=.19, P=.02). "
8401,2,"Number of webpages completed in modules was correlated with all demographic, disease severity, psychological, and social factors at pretest. "
8402,2,"(3) Program use and outcomes change: in general, use of the triggers and self-talk modules showed a consistent positive association with improvement in PDS, SCL-D, SFI, and CSE. "
8403,2,"The relaxation module was associated with positive change in PDS, but with negative change in CSS and SFI. "
8404,2,"The professional help module was associated with positive change in SCL-D, but its use on the first day was associated with negative change in CSS and CSE. "
8405,2,The unhelpful coping module was associated with negative change in SFI. 
8406,2,The mastery tools module showed a consistent association with negative change in PDS and SCL-D.
8407,3,"These findings suggest that both individual (eg, demographic, health problems, psychological) and social factors (eg, social functioning, social support) should be considered when delivering Web-based interventions, particularly in collectivist cultures. "
8408,3,"Specific program adherence indicators (eg, webpages completed in each module, activity types completed), rather than general program usage indicators (eg, total number or time of visiting), should be developed to examine the effectiveness of various program modules or elements."
8409,4,What it Takes to Successfully Implement Technology for Aging in Place: Focus Groups With Stakeholders
8410,0,"There is a growing interest in empowering older adults to age in place by deploying various types of technology (ie, eHealth, ambient assisted living technology, smart home technology, and gerontechnology). "
8411,0,"However, initiatives aimed at implementing these technologies are complicated by the fact that multiple stakeholder groups are involved. "
8412,0,"Goals and motives of stakeholders may not always be transparent or aligned, yet research on convergent and divergent positions of stakeholders is scarce."
8413,1,"Mono-disciplinary focus groups were conducted with participants (n=29) representing five groups of stakeholders: older adults (6/29, 21%), care professionals (7/29, 24%), managers within home care or social work organizations (5/29, 17%), technology designers and suppliers (6/29, 21%), and policy makers (5/29, 17%). "
8414,1,Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis.
8415,2,Stakeholders considered 26 different types of technologies to be relevant for enabling independent living. 
8416,2,Only 6 out of 26 (23%) types of technology were mentioned by all stakeholder groups. 
8417,2,Care professionals mentioned fewer different types of technology than other groups. 
8418,2,"All stakeholder groups felt that the implementation of technology for aging in place can be considered a success when (1) older adults' needs and wishes are prioritized during development and deployment of the technology, (2) the technology is accepted by older adults, (3) the technology provides benefits to older adults, and (4) favorable prerequisites for the use of technology by older adults exist. "
8419,2,"While stakeholders seemed to have identical aims, several underlying differences emerged, for example, with regard to who should pay for the technology. "
8420,2,"Additionally, each stakeholder group mentioned specific steps that need to be taken to achieve successful implementation. "
8421,2,"Collectively, stakeholders felt that they need to take the leap (ie, change attitudes, change policies, and collaborate with other organizations); bridge the gap (ie, match technology with individuals and stimulate interdisciplinary education); facilitate technology for the masses (ie, work on products and research that support large-scale rollouts and train target groups on how to use technology); and take time to reflect (ie, evaluate use and outcomes)."
8422,3,"Stakeholders largely agree on the direction in which they should be heading; however, they have different perspectives with regard to the technologies that can be employed and the work that is needed to implement them. "
8423,3,Central to these issues seems to be the tailoring of technology or technologies to the specific needs of each community-dwelling older adult and the work that is needed by stakeholders to support this type of service delivery on a large scale.
8424,4,The Pros and Cons of Getting Engaged in an Online Social Community Embedded Within Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia: Survey Among Users
8425,0,Sleepio is a proven digital sleep improvement program based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. 
8426,0,"Users have the option to join an online community that includes weekly expert discussions, peer-to-peer discussion forums, and personal message walls."
8427,1,We developed an online survey and posted an invitation to the community discussion forum inviting users to participate. 
8428,1,"In addition, we sent an email invitation to 970 individuals who had previously or were currently working through the Sleepio program to participate in this study."
8429,2,"In total, 100 respondents (70/100, 70% female; mean age 51 years, range 26-82 years) completed the online survey. "
8430,2,"Most respondents had started Sleepio with chronic sleep problems (59/100, 59% up to 10 years; 35/100, 35% >10 years) and had actively engaged with the online community (85/100, 85%) had made a discussion or wall post). "
8431,2,"At the time of the survey, respondents had used Sleepio for a median of 12 weeks (range from 3 weeks to 2 years). "
8432,2,We analyzed responses to the open-ended questions using thematic analysis. 
8433,2,"This analysis revealed 5 initial drivers for engagement: (1) the desire to connect with people facing similar issues, (2) seeking personalized advice, (3) curiosity, (4) being invited by other members, and (5) wanting to use all available sleep improvement tools. "
8434,2,"Advantages of engagement included access to continuous support, a reduced sense of isolation, being part of a nonjudgmental community, personalized advice, positive comparisons with others, encouragement to keep going, and altruism. "
8435,2,"We found 5 potential disadvantages: design and navigation issues, uncertain quality of user-generated content, negative comparisons with others, excessive time commitments, and data privacy concerns. "
8436,2,"Participants related their community experiences to engagement with the Sleepio program, with many stating it had supported their efforts to improve their sleep, as well as helping with adherence and commitment to the program. "
8437,2,"Despite some concerns, members regarded the Sleepio community as a valuable resource."
8438,3,Online communities may be a useful means through which to support long-term engagement with Web-based therapy for insomnia.
8439,4,Effectiveness of a Web-Based Simulation in Improving Nurses Workplace Practice With Deteriorating Ward Patients: A Pre- and Postintervention Study
8440,0,Nurses play an important role in detecting patients with clinical deterioration. 
8441,0,"However, the problem of nurses failing to trigger deteriorating ward patients still persists despite the implementation of a patient safety initiative, the Rapid Response System. "
8442,0,A Web-based simulation was developed to enhance nurses' role in recognizing and responding to deteriorating patients. 
8443,0,"While studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the Web-based simulation on nurses' clinical performance in a simulated environment, no study has examined its impact on nurses' actual practice in the clinical setting."
8444,1,A before-and-after study was conducted on two general wards at an acute care tertiary hospital over a 14-month period. 
8445,1,"All nurses from the two study wards who undertook the Web-based simulation as part of their continuing nursing education were invited to complete questionnaires at various time points to measure their motivational reaction, knowledge, and perceived transfer of learning. "
8446,1,Clinical records on cases triggered by ward nurses from the two study wards were evaluated for frequency and types of triggers over a period of 6 months pre- and 6 months postintervention.
8447,2,"The number of deteriorating patients triggered by ward nurses in a medical general ward increased significantly (P<.001) from pre- (84/937, 8.96%) to postintervention (91/624, 14.58%). "
8448,2,"The nurses reported positively on the transfer of learning (mean 3.89, SD 0.49) from the Web-based simulation to clinical practice. "
8449,2,A significant increase (P<.001) on knowledge posttest score from pretest score was also reported. 
8450,2,"The nurses also perceived positively their motivation (mean 3.78, SD 0.56) to engage in the Web-based simulation."
8451,3,This study provides evidence on the effectiveness of Web-based simulation in improving nursing practice when recognizing and responding to deteriorating patients. 
8452,3,This educational tool could be implemented by nurse educators worldwide to address the educational needs of a large group of hospital nurses responsible for patients in clinical deterioration.
8453,4,General Practitioners Concerns About Online Patient Feedback: Findings From a Descriptive Exploratory Qualitative Study in England
8454,0,"The growth in the volume of online patient feedback, including online patient ratings and comments, suggests that patients are embracing the opportunity to review online their experience of receiving health care. "
8455,0,Very little is known about health care professionals' attitudes toward online patient feedback and whether health care professionals are comfortable with the public nature of the feedback.
8456,1,A descriptive qualitative approach using face-to-face semistructured interviews was used in this study. 
8457,1,A topic guide was developed following a literature review and discussions with key stakeholders. 
8458,1,"GPs (N=20) were recruited from Cambridgeshire, London, and Northwest England through probability and snowball sampling. "
8459,1,"Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed in NVivo using the framework method, a form of thematic analysis."
8460,2,Most participants in this study had concerns about online patient feedback. 
8461,2,"They questioned the validity of online patient feedback because of data and user biases and lack of representativeness, the usability of online patient feedback due to the feedback being anonymous, the transparency of online patient feedback because of the risk of false allegations and breaching confidentiality, and the resulting impact of all those factors on them, their professional practice, and their relationship with their patients."
8462,3,The majority of GPs interviewed had reservations and concerns about online patient feedback and questioned its validity and usefulness among other things. 
8463,3,"Based on the findings from the study, recommendations for online patient feedback website providers in England are given. "
8464,3,"These include suggestions to make some specific changes to the platform and the need to promote online patient feedback more among both GPs and health care users, which may help to reduce some of the concerns raised by GPs about online patient feedback in this study."
8465,4,Web-Based Immersive Virtual Patient Simulators: Positive Effect on Clinical Reasoning in Medical Education
8466,0,Clinical reasoning is based on the declarative and procedural knowledge of workflows in clinical medicine. 
8467,0,Educational approaches such as problem-based learning or mannequin simulators support learning of procedural knowledge. 
8468,0,Immersive patient simulators (IPSs) go one step further as they allow an illusionary immersion into a synthetic world. 
8469,0,"Students can freely navigate an avatar through a three-dimensional environment, interact with the virtual surroundings, and treat virtual patients. "
8470,0,"By playful learning with IPS, medical workflows can be repetitively trained and internalized. "
8471,0,"As there are only a few university-driven IPS with a profound amount of medical knowledge available, we developed a university-based IPS framework. "
8472,0,Our simulator is free to use and combines a high degree of immersion with in-depth medical content. 
8473,0,"By adding disease-specific content modules, the simulator framework can be expanded depending on the curricular demands. "
8474,0,"However, these new educational tools compete with the traditional teaching"
8475,1,The new module was based on the declarative and procedural learning targets of the official German medical examination regulations. 
8476,1,The module was added to our custom-made IPS named ALICE (Artificial Learning Interface for Clinical Education). 
8477,1,ALICE was evaluated on 62 third-year students.
8478,2,Students showed a high degree of motivation when using the simulator as most of them had fun using it. 
8479,2,ALICE showed positive impact on clinical reasoning as there was a significant improvement in determining the correct therapy after using the simulator. 
8480,2,ALICE positively impacted the rise in declarative knowledge as there was improvement in answering multiple-choice questions before and after simulator use.
8481,3,ALICE has a positive effect on knowledge gain and raises students' motivation. 
8482,3,It is a suitable tool for supporting clinical education in the blended learning context.
8483,4,Mobile Apps for Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review of Features and Content Quality
8484,0,"With continued increases in smartphone ownership, researchers and clinicians are investigating the use of this technology to enhance the management of chronic illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD). "
8485,0,"Smartphones can be used to deliver interventions and psychoeducation, supplement treatment, and enhance therapeutic reach in BD, as apps are cost-effective, accessible, anonymous, and convenient. "
8486,0,"While the evidence-based development of BD apps is in its infancy, there has been an explosion of publicly available apps. "
8487,0,"However, the opportunity for mHealth to assist in the self-management of BD is only feasible if apps are of appropriate quality."
8488,1,"A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and assessment of apps. "
8489,1,We searched the Australian Google Play and iOS stores for English-language apps developed for people with BD. 
8490,1,The comprehensiveness and quality of information was assessed against core psychoeducation principles and current BD treatment guidelines. 
8491,1,Management tools were evaluated with reference to the best-practice resources for the specific area. 
8492,1,"General app features, and privacy and security were also assessed."
8493,2,"Of the 571 apps identified, 82 were included in the review. "
8494,2,"Of these, 32 apps provided information and the remaining 50 were management tools including screening and assessment (n=10), symptom monitoring (n=35), community support (n=4), and treatment (n=1). "
8495,2,"Not even a quarter of apps (18/82, 22%) addressed privacy and security by providing a privacy policy. "
8496,2,"Overall, apps providing information covered a third (4/11, 36%) of the core psychoeducation principles and even fewer (2/13, 15%) best-practice guidelines. "
8497,2,"Only a third (10/32, 31%) cited their information source. "
8498,2,"Neither comprehensiveness of psychoeducation information (r=-.11, P=.80) nor adherence to best-practice guidelines (r=-.02, P=.96) were significantly correlated with average user ratings. "
8499,2,"Symptom monitoring apps generally failed to monitor critical information such as medication (20/35, 57%) and sleep (18/35, 51%), and the majority of self-assessment apps did not use validated screening measures (6/10, 60%)."
8500,3,"In general, the content of currently available apps for BD is not in line with practice guidelines or established self-management principles. "
8501,3,"Apps also fail to provide important information to help users assess their quality, with most lacking source citation and a privacy policy. "
8502,3,"Therefore, both consumers and clinicians should exercise caution with app selection. "
8503,3,"While mHealth offers great opportunities for the development of quality evidence-based mobile interventions, new frameworks for mobile mental health research are needed to ensure the timely availability of evidence-based apps to the public."
8504,4,Who Uses the Internet as a Source of Nutrition and Dietary Information? An Australian Population Perspective
8505,0,The Internet contains a plethora of nutrition information. 
8506,0,Health organizations are increasingly using the Internet to deliver population-wide health information and interventions. 
8507,0,"Effective interventions identify their target population and their needs; however, little is known about use of the Internet as a source of nutrition information."
8508,1,Data were pooled from the Western Australian Department of Health's 3-yearly Nutrition Monitoring Survey Series telephone survey between 1995 and 2012 of 7044 participants aged 18 to 64 years. 
8509,1,Outcome variables were the main sources of nutrition information used in the last year and yes/no responses to 4 suggestions to what would make it easier to eat a healthy diet. 
8510,1,Sociodemographic variables were collected.
8511,2,The proportion of respondents using the Internet for nutrition information increased from <1% in 1995-2001 to 9.1% in 2004 and 33.7% in 2012. 
8512,2,"Compared to 2004, logistic regression showed that the odds of using the Internet for this information increased significantly in 2009 (OR 2.84, 95% CI 2.07-3.88) and 2012 (OR 5.20, 95% CI 3.86-7.02, P<.001). "
8513,2,"Respondents using the Internet as a source were more likely to be female (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.60, P=.02), live in a metropolitan area (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.54, P=.03), born in countries other than Australia/UK/Ireland (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07-1.85, P=.02), more educated (university: OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.77-3.42, P<.001), and were less likely to be older (55-64 years: OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25-0.57, P<.001). "
8514,2,"The majority of respondents agreed the following information would assist them to make healthier choices: more ways to prepare healthy foods (72.0%, 95% CI 70.7-73.3), quicker ways to prepare healthy foods (79.0%, 95% CI 77.8-80.1), how to choose healthy foods (68.8%, 95% CI 67.5-70.1), and knowing more about cooking (54.7%, 95% CI 53.3-56.1). "
8515,2,"Those using the Internet for nutrition information were more likely than nonusers to want to know quicker ways to prepare healthy foods (83.0% vs 78.1%, P=.005) and information on choosing healthy foods (76.3% vs 67.3%, P<.001)."
8516,3,Use of the Internet as a main source of nutrition information has grown rapidly since 2004; one-third of Western Australian adults reported using the Internet for this purpose in 2012. 
8517,3,"Information on preparing healthy foods (ideas, quicker ways), choosing ingredients, and knowing more about cooking would make it easier to eat a healthy diet. "
8518,3,"For Internet users, emphasis should be on quicker ways and choosing ingredients. "
8519,3,These finding have implications for policy makers and practitioners and suggest that traditional health promotion tactics should continue to be used to reach the broader population.
8520,4,The Role of Social Network Technologies in Online Health Promotion: A Narrative Review of Theoretical and Empirical Factors Influencing Intervention Effectiveness
8521,0,Social network technologies have become part of health education and wider health promotion-either by design or happenstance. 
8522,0,"Social support, peer pressure, and information sharing in online communities may affect health behaviors. "
8523,0,"If there are positive and sustained effects, then social network technologies could increase the effectiveness and efficiency of many public health campaigns. "
8524,0,"Social media alone, however, may be insufficient to promote health. "
8525,0,"Furthermore, there may be unintended and potentially harmful consequences of inaccurate or misleading health information. "
8526,0,"Given these uncertainties, there is a need to understand and synthesize the evidence base for the use of online social networking as part of health promoting interventions to inform future research and practice."
8527,1,The narrative synthesis approach to literature review was used to analyze the existing evidence. 
8528,1,We searched the indexed scientific literature using keywords associated with health promotion and social networking. 
8529,1,The papers included were only those making substantial study of both social networking and health promotion-either reporting the results of the intervention or detailing evidence-based plans. 
8530,1,General papers about social networking and health were not included.
8531,2,The search identified 162 potentially relevant documents after review of titles and abstracts. 
8532,2,"Of these, 42 satisfied the inclusion criteria after full-text review. "
8533,2,Six studies described randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of online social networking within health promotion interventions. 
8534,2,"Most of the trials investigated the value of a ""social networking condition"" in general and did not identify specific features that might play a role in effectiveness. "
8535,2,"Issues about the usability and level of uptake of interventions were more common among pilot studies, while observational studies showed positive evidence about the role of social support. "
8536,2,"A total of 20 papers showed the use of theory in the design of interventions, but authors evaluated effectiveness in only 10 papers."
8537,3,More research is needed in this area to understand the actual effect of social network technologies on health promotion. 
8538,3,More RCTs of greater length need to be conducted taking into account contextual factors such as patient characteristics and types of a social network technology. 
8539,3,"Also, more evidence is needed regarding the actual usability of online social networking and how different interface design elements may help or hinder behavior change and engagement. "
8540,3,"Moreover, it is crucial to investigate further the effect of theory on the effectiveness of this type of technology for health promotion. "
8541,3,Research is needed linking theoretical grounding with observation and analysis of health promotion in online networks.
8542,4,Automated Detection of HONcode Website Conformity Compared to Manual Detection: An Evaluation
8543,0,"To earn HONcode certification, a website must conform to the 8 principles of the HONcode of Conduct In the current manual process of certification, a HONcode expert assesses the candidate website using precise guidelines for each principle. "
8544,0,"In the scope of the European project KHRESMOI, the Health on the Net (HON) Foundation has developed an automated system to assist in detecting a website's HONcode conformity. "
8545,0,Automated assistance in conducting HONcode reviews can expedite the current time-consuming tasks of HONcode certification and ongoing surveillance. 
8546,0,"Additionally, an automated tool used as a plugin to a general search engine might help to detect health websites that respect HONcode principles but have not yet been certified."
8547,1,"Using manual evaluation by HONcode senior experts as a baseline, this study compared the capability of the automated HONcode detection system to that of the HONcode senior experts. "
8548,1,A set of 27 health-related websites were manually assessed for compliance to each of the 8 HONcode principles by senior HONcode experts. 
8549,1,The same set of websites were processed by the automated system for HONcode compliance detection based on supervised machine learning. 
8550,1,The results obtained by these two methods were then compared.
8551,2,"For the privacy criterion, the automated system obtained the same results as the human expert for 17 of 27 sites (14 true positives and 3 true negatives) without noise (0 false positives). "
8552,2,"The remaining 10 false negative instances for the privacy criterion represented tolerable behavior because it is important that all automatically detected principle conformities are accurate (ie, specificity [100%] is preferred over sensitivity [58%] for the privacy criterion). "
8553,2,"In addition, the automated system had precision of at least 75%, with a recall of more than 50% for contact details (100% precision, 69% recall), authority (85% precision, 52% recall), and reference (75% precision, 56% recall). "
8554,2,The results also revealed issues for some criteria such as date. 
8555,2,"Changing the ""document"" definition (ie, using the sentence instead of whole document as a unit of classification) within the automated system resolved some but not all of them."
8556,3,"Study results indicate concordance between automated and expert manual compliance detection for authority, privacy, reference, and contact details. "
8557,3,Results also indicate that using the same general parameters for automated detection of each criterion produces suboptimal results. 
8558,3,Future work to configure optimal system parameters for each HONcode principle would improve results. 
8559,3,The potential utility of integrating automated detection of HONcode conformity into future search engines is also discussed.
8560,4,Patient Use of Email for Health Care Communication Purposes Across 14 European Countries: An Analysis of Users According to Demographic and Health-Related Factors
8561,0,"The use of the Internet for health purposes is growing steadily, yet the use of asynchronous communication tools for health care purposes remains undeveloped. "
8562,0,The introduction of email as a method of communication in health care has the potential to impact on both patients and health care professionals.
8563,1,"We conducted a secondary analysis of data ( N=14,000) collected from the online Citizens and Information Communication Technology for Health survey, a project undertaken in 2011 by the Institute for Prospective Technology Studies of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. "
8564,1,The survey was developed to understand and characterize European citizens' use of information communication technologies for health. 
8565,1,Descriptive and statistical analyses of association were used to interpret the data.
8566,2,"Denmark reported the highest level of emails sent/received ( 507/1000, 50.70%). "
8567,2,"The lowest level reported was by participants in France ( 187/1000, 18.70%). "
8568,2,"Men used email communication for health care more than women, as did respondents in the 16-24 age group and those educated to tertiary level or still within the education system. "
8569,2,"As self-reported health state worsens, the proportion of people reporting having sent or received an email within the context of health care increases. "
8570,2,"Email use, poor health, multimorbidity, and number of visits to a physician are positively correlated."
8571,3,The use of email communication within the context of European health care is extremely varied. 
8572,3,"The relationship between high email use, poor health, doctor visits, and multimorbidity is especially pertinent: provision of asynchronous communication for such groups is favored by policymakers. "
8573,3,Low reported email use by country may not necessarily reflect low interest in using email for health care: local health policies and technical infrastructures may be significant factors in the delay in implementation of alternative forms of routine health communication.
8574,4,Picture Me Smokefree: A Qualitative Study Using Social Media and Digital Photography to Engage Young Adults in Tobacco Reduction and Cessation
8575,0,"Young adults have high rates of tobacco use compared to other subpopulations, yet there are relatively few tobacco interventions specifically targeted to this group. "
8576,0,Picture Me Smokefree is an online tobacco reduction and cessation intervention for young adults that uses digital photography and social networking.
8577,1,"A total of 60 young adults ages 19-24 years who self-identified as current cigarette smokers or who had quit within the last year were recruited from across British Columbia, Canada, and participated in an online photo group on Facebook over a period of 12 consecutive weeks. "
8578,1,"A variety of data collection methods were used including tracking online activity, a brief online follow-up survey, and qualitative interviews with study participants. "
8579,1,"Data analysis involved descriptive statistics on recruitment, retention, and participation and qualitative (eg, narrative analysis, synthesis of feedback) feedback about participant engagement."
8580,2,"Findings from this study suggest good potential for Facebook as an accessible, low-cost platform for engaging young adults to reflect on the reasons for their tobacco use, the benefits of quitting or reducing, and the best strategies for tobacco reduction. "
8581,2,Young adults' frequent use of mobile phones and other mobile devices to access social networking permitted ease of access and facilitated real-time peer-to-peer support across a diverse group of participants. 
8582,2,"However, our experience of conducting the study suggests that working with young tobacco users can be accompanied by considerable recruitment, participation, and retention challenges. "
8583,2,"Our findings also pointed to differences in how young women and men engaged the photo-group intervention that should be considered, bearing in mind that in follow-up interviews participants indicated their preference for a mixed gender and ""gender neutral"" group format."
8584,3,"Tobacco interventions for youth and young adults should be embedded within the existing social networking platforms they access most frequently, rather than designing a stand-alone online prevention or intervention resource. "
8585,3,This subpopulation would likely benefit from tobacco reduction interventions that are gender-sensitive rather than gender-specific.
8586,4,Earned Media and Public Engagement With CDCs Tips From Former Smokers Campaign: An Analysis of Online News and Blog Coverage
8587,0,"In March 2012, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the first-ever paid national tobacco education campaign. "
8588,0,"At a cost of US $54 million, ""Tips from Former Smokers"" (Tips) ran for 3 months across multiple media, depicting the suffering experienced by smokers and their families in graphic detail. "
8589,0,The potential impact and reach of the Tips campaign was not limited to that achieved through paid media placements. 
8590,0,"It was also potentially extended through ""earned media"", including news and blog coverage of the campaign. "
8591,0,Such coverage can shape public understanding of and facilitate public engagement with key health issues.
8592,1,"We constructed a purposive sample of online media coverage of the CDC's 2012 Tips from Former Smokers television campaign, focusing on 14 influential and politically diverse US news outlets and policy-focused blogs. "
8593,1,We identified relevant content by combining campaign and website-specific keywords for 4 months around the campaign release. 
8594,1,"Each story was coded for content, inclusion of multimedia, and measures of audience engagement."
8595,2,"The search yielded 36 stories mentioning Tips, of which 27 were focused on the campaign. "
8596,2,"Story content between pieces was strikingly similar, with most stories highlighting the same points about the campaign's content, cost, and potential impact. "
8597,2,"We saw notable evidence of audience engagement; stories focused on Tips generated 9547 comments, 8891 Facebook ""likes"", 1027 tweets, and 505 story URL shares on Facebook. "
8598,2,"Audience engagement varied by story and site, as did the valence and relevance of associated audience comments. "
8599,2,Comments were most oppositional on CNN and most supportive on Yahoo. 
8600,2,Comment coding revealed approximately equal levels of opposition and support overall. 
8601,2,"We identified four common arguments among oppositional comments: government intrusion on personal behaviors, problematic allocation of governmental spending, questionable science, and challenges regarding campaign efficacy. "
8602,2,Supportive comments tended to convey personal stories and emotions.
8603,3,"The Tips campaign received limited coverage on either online news or blog sources, but the limited number of stories generated engagement among online audiences. "
8604,3,"In addition to the content and volume of blog and news coverage, audience comments and websites' mechanisms for sharing stories via social media are likely to determine the influence of online earned media. "
8605,3,"In order to facilitate meaningful evaluation of public health campaigns within the rapidly advancing media environment, there is a need for the public health community to build consensus regarding collection and assessment of engagement data."
8606,4,Short- and Medium-Term Efficacy of a Web-Based Computer-Tailored Nutrition Education Intervention for Adults Including Cognitive and Environmental Feedback: Randomized Controlled Trial
8607,0,"Web-based, computer-tailored nutrition education interventions can be effective in modifying self-reported dietary behaviors. "
8608,0,"Traditional computer-tailored programs primarily targeted individual cognitions (knowledge, awareness, attitude, self-efficacy). "
8609,0,Tailoring on additional variables such as self-regulation processes and environmental-level factors (the home food environment arrangement and perception of availability and prices of healthy food products in supermarkets) may improve efficacy and effect sizes (ES) of Web-based computer-tailored nutrition education interventions.
8610,1,"A randomized controlled trial was conducted with a basic (tailored intervention targeting individual cognition and self-regulation processes; n=456), plus (basic intervention additionally targeting environmental-level factors; n=459), and control (generic nutrition information; n=434) group. "
8611,1,Participants were recruited from the general population and randomly assigned to a study group. 
8612,1,"Self-reported fruit, vegetable, high-energy snack, and saturated fat intake were assessed at baseline and at 1-(T1) and 4-months (T2) postintervention using online questionnaires. "
8613,1,Linear mixed model analyses examined group differences in change over time. 
8614,1,Educational differences were examined with groupxtimexeducation interaction terms.
8615,2,"In the total sample, the basic (T1: ES=-0.30; T2: ES=-0.18) and plus intervention groups (T1: ES=-0.29; T2: ES=-0.27) had larger decreases in high-energy snack intake than the control group. "
8616,2,The basic version resulted in a larger decrease in saturated fat intake than the control intervention (T1: ES=-0.19; T2: ES=-0.17). 
8617,2,"In the risk groups, the basic version caused larger decreases in fat (T1: ES=-0.28; T2: ES=-0.28) and high-energy snack intake (T1: ES=-0.34; T2: ES=-0.20) than the control intervention. "
8618,2,The plus version resulted in a larger increase in fruit (T1: ES=0.25; T2: ES=0.37) and a larger decrease in high-energy snack intake (T1: ES=-0.38; T2: ES=-0.32) than the control intervention. 
8619,2,"For high-energy snack intake, educational differences were found. "
8620,2,Stratified analyses showed that the plus version was most effective for high-educated participants.
8621,3,"Both intervention versions were more effective in improving some of the self-reported dietary behaviors than generic nutrition information, especially in the risk groups, among both higher-and lower-educated participants. "
8622,3,"For fruit intake, only the plus version was more effective than providing generic nutrition information. "
8623,3,"Although feasible, incorporating environmental-level information is time-consuming. "
8624,3,"Therefore, the basic version may be more feasible for further implementation, although inclusion of feedback on the arrangement of the home food environment and on availability and prices may be considered for fruit and, for high-educated people, for high-energy snack intake."
8625,4,The Effect of Individual Factors on Health Behaviors Among College Students: The Mediating Effects of eHealth Literacy
8626,0,College students' health behavior is a topic that deserves attention. 
8627,0,Individual factors and eHealth literacy may affect an individual's health behaviors. 
8628,0,"The integrative model of eHealth use (IMeHU) provides a parsimonious account of the connections among the digital divide, health care disparities, and the unequal distribution and use of communication technologies. "
8629,0,"However, few studies have explored the associations among individual factors, eHealth literacy, and health behaviors, and IMeHU has not been empirically investigated."
8630,1,"The Health Behavior Scale is a 12-item instrument developed to measure college students' eating, exercise, and sleep behaviors. "
8631,1,"The eHealth Literacy Scale is a 12-item instrument designed to measure college students' functional, interactive, and critical eHealth literacy. "
8632,1,A nationally representative sample of 525 valid college students in Taiwan was surveyed. 
8633,1,"A questionnaire was administered to collect background information about participants' health status, degree of health concern, major, and the frequency with which they engaged in health-related discussions. "
8634,1,This study used Amos 6.0 to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to identify the best measurement models for the eHealth Literacy Scale and the Health Behavior Scale. 
8635,1,"We then conducted a multiple regression analysis to examine the associations among individual factors, eHealth literacy, and health behaviors. "
8636,1,"Additionally, causal steps approach was used to explore indirect (mediating) effects and Sobel tests were used to test the significance of the mediating effects."
8637,2,"The study found that perceptions of better health status (t(520)=2.14-6.12, P<.001-.03) and greater concern for health (t(520)=2.58-6.95, P<.001-.003) influenced college students' development of 3 dimensions of eHealth literacy and adoption of healthy eating, exercise, and sleep behaviors. "
8638,2,"Moreover, eHealth literacy played an intermediary role in the association between individual factors and health behaviors (Sobel test=2.09-2.72, P<.001-.03). "
8639,2,"Specifically, higher levels of critical eHealth literacy promoted students' health status and their practice of multiple positive health behaviors, including eating, exercise, and sleep behaviors."
8640,3,"Because this study showed that eHealth literacy mediates the association between individual factors and health behaviors, schools should aim to enhance students' eHealth literacy and promote their health behaviors to help them achieve high levels of critical eHealth literacy. "
8641,3,"Although some of the study's hypotheses were not supported in this study, the factors that influence health behaviors are complex and interdependent. "
8642,3,"Therefore, a follow-up study should be conducted to further explore how these factors influence one another."
8643,4,Mobile Phone Text Messaging Intervention for Cervical Cancer Screening: Changes in Knowledge and Behavior Pre-Post Intervention
8644,0,"Cervical cancer poses a significant threat to Korean American women, who are reported to have one of the highest cervical cancer mortality rates in the United States. "
8645,0,Studies consistently report that Korean American women have the lowest Pap test screening rates across US ethnic groups.
8646,1,"We developed and assessed the acceptability and feasibility of a 1-week mScreening intervention to increase knowledge of cervical cancer screening, intent to receive screening, and the receipt of a Pap test. "
8647,1,Fogg's Behavior Model was the conceptual framework that guided the development of the mScreening intervention. 
8648,1,A series of focus groups were conducted to inform the development of the intervention. 
8649,1,The messages were individually tailored for each participant and delivered to them for a 7-day period at each participant's preferred time. 
8650,1,"A quasi-experimental research design of 30 Korean American women aged 21 to 29 years was utilized with baseline, post (1 week after the completion of mScreening), and follow-up (3 months after the completion of mScreening) testing."
8651,2,Findings revealed a significant increase in participants' knowledge of cervical cancer (P<.001) and guidelines for cervical cancer screening (P=.006). 
8652,2,"A total of 23% (7/30) (95% CI 9.9-42.3) of the mScreening participants received a Pap test; 83% (25/30) of the participants expressed satisfaction with the intervention and 97% (29/30) reported that they would recommend the program to their friends, indicating excellent acceptability and feasibility of the intervention."
8653,3,This study provides evidence of the effectiveness and feasibility of the mScreening intervention. 
8654,3,Mobile technology is a promising tool to increase both knowledge and receipt of cervical cancer screening. 
8655,3,"Given the widespread usage of mobile phones among young adults, a mobile phone-based health intervention could be a low-cost and effective method of reaching populations with low cervical cancer screening rates, using individually tailored messages that cover broad content areas and overcome restrictions to place and time of delivery."
8656,4,Evaluating a Web-Based Clinical Decision Support System for Language Disorders Screening in a Nursery School
8657,0,Early and effective identification of developmental disorders during childhood remains a critical task for the international community. 
8658,0,"The second highest prevalence of common developmental disorders in children are language delays, which are frequently the first symptoms of a possible disorder."
8659,1,"This paper details the evaluation results of the ""Gades"" CDSS at a nursery school with 146 children, 12 educators, and 1 language therapist. "
8660,1,The methodology embraces two consecutive phases. 
8661,1,"The first stage involves the observation of each child's language abilities, carried out by the educators, to facilitate the evaluation of language acquisition level performed by a language therapist. "
8662,1,"Next, the same language therapist evaluates the reliability of the observed results."
8663,2,The Gades CDSS was integrated to provide the language therapist with the required clinical information. 
8664,2,The validation process showed a global 83.6% (122/146) success rate in language evaluation and a 7% (7/94) rate of non-accepted system decisions within the range of children from 0 to 3 years old. 
8665,2,The system helped language therapists to identify new children with potential disorders who required further evaluation. 
8666,2,This process will revalidate the CDSS output and allow the enhancement of early detection of language disorders in children. 
8667,2,"The system does need minor refinement, since the therapists disagreed with some questions from the CDSS knowledge base (KB) and suggested adding a few questions about speech production and pragmatic abilities. "
8668,2,"The refinement of the KB will address these issues and include the requested improvements, with the support of the experts who took part in the original KB development."
8669,3,This research demonstrated the benefit of a Web-based CDSS to monitor children's neurodevelopment via the early detection of language delays at a nursery school. 
8670,3,"Current next steps focus on the design of a model that includes pseudo auto-learning capacity, supervised by experts."
8671,4,Web-Based Intervention in Mindfulness Meditation for Reducing Residual Depressive Symptoms and Relapse Prophylaxis: A Qualitative Study
8672,0,Mindful Mood Balance (MMB) is a Web-based intervention designed to treat residual depressive symptoms and prevent relapse. 
8673,0,"MMB was designed to deliver the core concepts of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), a group treatment, which, despite its strong evidence base, faces a number of dissemination challenges."
8674,1,Qualitative content analysis was conducted via 38 exit interviews with MMB participants. 
8675,1,Study inclusion required a current PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire) score <= 12 and lifetime history >= 1 major depressive episode. 
8676,1,"Feedback was obtained on specific website components, program content, and administration as well as skills learned."
8677,2,"Codes were assigned to interview responses and organized into four main themes: MBCT Web content, MBCT Web-based group process, home practice, and evidence of concept comprehension. "
8678,2,"Within these four areas, participants highlighted the advantages and obstacles of translating and delivering MBCT in a Web-based format. "
8679,2,Adding increased support was suggested for troubleshooting session content as well as managing time challenges for completing home mindfulness practice. 
8680,2,"Participants endorsed developing affect regulation skills and identified several advantages to Web-based delivery including flexibility, reduced cost, and time commitment."
8681,3,These findings support the viability of providing MBCT online and are consistent with prior qualitative accounts derived from in-person MBCT groups. 
8682,3,"While there is certainly room for innovation in the domains of program support and engagement, the high levels of participant satisfaction indicated that MMB can significantly increase access to evidence-based psychological treatments for sub-threshold symptoms of unipolar affective disorder."
8683,4,The Use of Social Networking Sites for Public Health Practice and Research: A Systematic Review
8684,0,"Social networking sites (SNSs) have the potential to increase the reach and efficiency of essential public health services, such as surveillance, research, and communication."
8685,1,"We performed a systematic literature review of articles related to public health and SNSs using PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL to search for peer-reviewed publications describing the use of SNSs for public health research and practice. "
8686,1,We also conducted manual searches of relevant publications. 
8687,1,Each publication was independently reviewed by 2 researchers for inclusion and extracted relevant study data.
8688,2,A total of 73 articles met our inclusion criteria. 
8689,2,Most articles (n= 50) were published in the final 2 years covered by our search. 
8690,2,"In all, 58 articles were in the domain of public health research and 15 were in public health practice. "
8691,2,Only 1 study was conducted in a low-income country. 
8692,2,"Most articles (63/73, 86%) described observational studies involving users or usages of SNSs; only 5 studies involved randomized controlled trials. "
8693,2,"A large proportion (43/73, 59%) of the identified studies included populations considered hard to reach, such as young individuals, adolescents, and individuals at risk of sexually transmitted diseases or alcohol and substance abuse. "
8694,2,"Few articles (2/73, 3%) described using the multidirectional communication potential of SNSs to engage study populations."
8695,3,The number of publications about public health uses for SNSs has been steadily increasing in the past 5 years. 
8696,3,"With few exceptions, the literature largely consists of observational studies describing users and usages of SNSs regarding topics of public health interest. "
8697,3,More studies that fully exploit the communication tools embedded in SNSs and study their potential to produce significant effects in the overall population's health are needed.
8698,4,Supporting Self-Care for Families of Children With Eczema With a Web-Based Intervention Plus Health Care Professional Support: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
8699,0,"Childhood eczema, or childhood atopic dermatitis, causes significant distress to children and their families through sleep disturbance and itch. "
8700,0,The main cause of treatment failure is nonuse of prescribed treatments.
8701,1,We followed the PRECEDE-PROCEED model: regular emollient use was the target behavior we were seeking to promote and we identified potential techniques to influence this. 
8702,1,LifeGuide software was used to write the intervention website. 
8703,1,"Carers of children with eczema were invited through primary care mail-out and randomized to 3 groups: (1) website only, (2) website plus HCP support, or (3) usual care. "
8704,1,Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) scores were measured online by carer report at baseline and at 12 weeks. 
8705,1,Qualitative interviews were carried out with 13 HCPs (primarily practice nurses) and 26 participants to explore their experiences of taking part in the study.
8706,2,A total of 143 carers were recruited through 31 practices. 
8707,2,"We found a decrease of >= 2 in follow-up compared with baseline POEM score in 23 of 42 (55%) participants in the website only group, 16 of 49 (33%) in the usual care group, and 18 of 47 (38%) in the website plus HCP group. "
8708,2,"Website use data showed that 75 of 93 (81%) participants allocated to the website groups completed the core modules, but less than half used other key components (videos: 35%; regular text reminders: 39%). "
8709,2,There were no consistent differences in website use between the website only or the website plus HCP groups. 
8710,2,Qualitative feedback showed that most HCPs had initial concerns about providing support for eczema self-care because this was not a condition that they felt expert in. 
8711,2,"However, HCPs reported productive consultations and that they found it helpful to use the website in consultations, while observing that some participants seemed to need more support than others. "
8712,2,"Qualitative interviews with participants suggested that HCP support was valued highly only by a minority, generally those who were less confident in their management of eczema or less confident using the Internet."
8713,3,Our pilot trial demonstrated the potential for greater improvements in POEM scores in both website intervention groups and that a full-scale trial is feasible. 
8714,3,Such a trial would quantify the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this intervention to determine whether it should be widely promoted to families of children with newly diagnosed eczema. 
8715,3,"In this study population, HCP support was not strongly valued by participants and did not lead to better outcomes or website use than use of the Web-based intervention alone."
8716,4,Evaluation of a Novel Conjunctive Exploratory Navigation Interface for Consumer Health Information: A Crowdsourced Comparative Study
8717,0,Numerous consumer health information websites have been developed to provide consumers access to health information. 
8718,0,"However, lookup search is insufficient for consumers to take full advantage of these rich public information resources. "
8719,0,"Exploratory search is considered a promising complementary mechanism, but its efficacy has never before been rigorously evaluated for consumer health information retrieval interfaces."
8720,1,"We collected over 60,000 consumer health questions from NetWellness, one of the first consumer health websites to provide high-quality health information. "
8721,1,We designed and developed a novel conjunctive exploratory navigation interface to explore NetWellness health questions with health topics as dynamic and searchable menus. 
8722,1,"To investigate the effectiveness of CENI, we developed a second interface with keyword-based search only. "
8723,1,"A crowdsourcing comparative study was carefully designed to compare three search modes of interest: (A) the topic-navigation-based CENI, (B) the keyword-based lookup interface, and (C) either the most commonly available lookup search interface with Google, or the resident advanced search offered by NetWellness. "
8724,1,"To compare the effectiveness of the three search modes, 9 search tasks were designed with relevant health questions from NetWellness. "
8725,1,Each task included a rating of difficulty level and questions for validating the quality of answers. 
8726,1,Ninety anonymous and unique AMT workers were recruited as participants.
8727,2,"Repeated-measures ANOVA analysis of the data showed the search modes A, B, and C had statistically significant differences among their levels of difficulty (P<.001). "
8728,2,Wilcoxon signed-rank test (one-tailed) between A and B showed that A was significantly easier than B (P<.001). 
8729,2,Paired t tests (one-tailed) between A and C showed A was significantly easier than C (P<.001). 
8730,2,"Participant responses on the preferred search modes showed that 47.8% (43/90) participants preferred A, 25.6% (23/90) preferred B, 24.4% (22/90) preferred C. "
8731,2,"Participant comments on the preferred search modes indicated that CENI was easy to use, provided better organization of health questions by topics, allowed users to narrow down to the most relevant contents quickly, and supported the exploratory navigation by non-experts or those unsure how to initiate their search."
8732,3,We presented a novel conjunctive exploratory navigation interface for consumer health information retrieval and navigation. 
8733,3,Crowdsourcing permitted a carefully designed comparative search-interface evaluation to be completed in a timely and cost-effective manner with a relatively large number of participants recruited anonymously. 
8734,3,"Accounting for possible biases, our study has shown for the first time with crowdsourcing that the combination of exploratory navigation and lookup search is more effective than lookup search alone."
8735,4,Applying Computerized Adaptive Testing to the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised: Rasch Analysis of Workplace Bullying
8736,0,Workplace bullying is a prevalent problem in contemporary work places that has adverse effects on both the victims of bullying and organizations. 
8737,0,"With the rapid development of computer technology in recent years, there is an urgent need to prove whether item response theory-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT) can be applied to measure exposure to workplace bullying."
8738,1,A total of 300 nurses were recruited and responded to the 22-item Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R). 
8739,1,All NAT (or CAT-selected) items were calibrated with the Rasch rating scale model and all respondents were randomly selected for a comparison of the advantages of CAT and NAT in efficiency and precision by paired t tests and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
8740,2,The NAQ-R is a unidimensional construct that can be applied to measure exposure to workplace bullying through CAT-based administration. 
8741,2,Nursing measures derived from both tests (CAT and NAT) were highly correlated (r=.97) and their measurement precisions were not statistically different (P=.49) as expected. 
8742,2,"CAT required fewer items than NAT (an efficiency gain of 32%), suggesting a reduced burden for respondents. "
8743,2,There were significant differences in work tenure between the 2 groups (bullied and nonbullied) at a cutoff point of 6 years at 1 worksite. 
8744,2,An AUROC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.68-0.79) with logits greater than -4.2 (or >30 in summation) was defined as being highly likely bullied in a workplace.
8745,3,"With CAT-based administration of the NAQ-R for nurses, their burden was substantially reduced without compromising measurement precision."
8746,4,Understanding Usage of a Hybrid Website and Smartphone App for Weight Management: A Mixed-Methods Study
8747,0,Advancements in mobile phone technology offer huge potential for enhancing the timely delivery of health behavior change interventions. 
8748,0,"The development of smartphone-based health interventions (apps) is a rapidly growing field of research, yet there have been few longitudinal examinations of how people experience and use these apps within their day-to-day routines, particularly within the context of a hybrid Web-and app-based intervention."
8749,1,Thirteen adults were provided access to POWeR and were monitored over a 4-week period. 
8750,1,"Access to POWeR Tracker was provided in 2 alternate weeks (ie, weeks 1 and 3 or weeks 2 and 4). "
8751,1,Participants' goal engagement was measured daily via self-report. 
8752,1,Mixed effects models were used to examine change in goal engagement between the weeks when POWeR Tracker was and was not available and whether the extent of change in goal engagement varied between individual participants. 
8753,1,Usage of POWeR and POWeR Tracker was automatically recorded for each participant. 
8754,1,Telephone interviews were conducted and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis to further explore participants' experiences using POWeR and POWeR Tracker.
8755,2,"Access to POWeR Tracker was associated with a significant increase in participants' awareness of their eating (beta(1)= 0.31, P=.04) and physical activity goals (beta(1)= 0.28, P=.03). "
8756,2,The level of increase varied between individual participants. 
8757,2,"Usage data showed that participants used the POWeR website for similar amounts of time during the weeks when POWeR Tracker was (mean 29 minutes, SD 31 minutes) and was not available (mean 27 minutes, SD 33 minutes). "
8758,2,"POWeR Tracker was mostly accessed in short bursts (mean 3 minutes, SD 2 minutes) during convenient moments or moments when participants deemed the intervention content most relevant. "
8759,2,The qualitative data indicated that nearly all participants agreed that it was more convenient to access information on-the-go via their mobiles compared to a computer. 
8760,2,"However, participants varied in their views and usage of the Web-versus app-based components and the informational versus tracking tools provided by POWeR Tracker."
8761,3,This study provides evidence that smartphones have the potential to improve individuals' engagement with their health-related goals when used as a supplement to an existing online intervention. 
8762,3,The perceived convenience of mobile access to information does not appear to deter use of Web-based interventions or strengthen the impact of app access on goal engagement. 
8763,3,A mixed-methods design enabled exploration of individual variation in daily usage of the app-based tools.
8764,4,"Impact of Seasonality on Recruitment, Retention, Adherence, and Outcomes in a Web-Based Smoking Cessation Intervention: Randomized Controlled Trial"
8765,0,"Seasonal variations in smoking and quitting behaviors have been documented, with many smokers seeking cessation assistance around the start of the New Year. "
8766,0,"What remains unknown is whether smokers who are recruited to cessation treatment trials during the New Year are as motivated to quit, or as likely to enroll in a research trial, adhere to a research protocol, and benefit from a cessation intervention compared to those who are recruited during other times of the year."
8767,1,Participants were current smokers who had registered on a free Web-based cessation program (BecomeAnEX. 
8768,1,org) and were invited to participate in a clinical trial. 
8769,1,"The New Year period was defined according to a clear peak and drop in the proportion of visitors who registered on the site, spanning a 15-day period from December 26, 2012 to January 9, 2013. "
8770,1,"Two other 15-day recruitment periods during summer (July 18, 2012 to August 1, 2012) and fall (November 7, 2012 to November 21, 2012) were selected for comparison. "
8771,1,"Data were examined from 3 sources: (1) a Web-based clinical trials management system that automated the recruitment and enrollment process, (2) self-report assessments at baseline and 3 months postrandomization, and (3) online tracking software that recorded website utilization during the first 3 months of the trial."
8772,2,"Visitors to BecomeAnEX during the New Year period were more likely to register on the site than smokers who visited during summer or fall (conversion rates: 7.4%, 4.6%, 4.9%, respectively; P<.001), but there were no differences in rates of study acceptance, consent, randomization, 3-month follow-up survey completion, or cessation between the 3 periods. "
8773,2,"New Year participants were older, more educated, more likely to be employed full time, and more likely to have a relationship partner compared with participants recruited at other times during the year, but did not differ on measures of motivation and desire to quit."
8774,3,"Smokers visiting a Web-based cessation program during the New Year period were more likely to register for treatment and differ on several demographic variables, but showed similar patterns of treatment engagement, retention, follow-up, and short-term cessation outcomes compared with participants who visited the site during other periods of the year. "
8775,3,These results allay scientific concerns about recruiting participants during this time frame and are reassuring for researchers conducting Web-based cessation trials.
8776,4,Assessing the Internal and External Validity of Mobile Health Physical Activity Promotion Interventions: A Systematic Literature Review Using the RE-AIM Framework
8777,0,"Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are effective in promoting physical activity (PA); however, the degree to which external validity indicators are reported is unclear."
8778,1,"Twenty articles reflecting 15 trials published between 2000 and 2012 were identified through a systematic review process (ie, queries of three online databases and reference lists of eligible articles) and met inclusion criteria (ie, implementation of mobile technologies, target physical activity, and provide original data). "
8779,1,"Two researchers coded each article using a validated RE-AIM data extraction tool (reach, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance). "
8780,1,Two members of the study team independently abstracted information from each article (inter-rater reliability > 90%) and group meetings were used to gain consensus on discrepancies.
8781,2,The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (n=14). 
8782,2,"The average reporting across RE-AIM indicators varied by dimension (reach=53.3%, 2.67/5; effectiveness/efficacy=60.0%, 2.4/4; adoption=11.1%, 0.7/6; implementation=24.4%, 0.7/3; maintenance=0%, 0/3). "
8783,2,"While most studies described changes in the primary outcome (effectiveness), few addressed the representativeness of participants (reach) or settings (adoption) and few reported on issues related to maintenance and degree of implementation fidelity."
8784,3,This review suggests that more focus is needed on research designs that highlight and report on both internal and external validity indicators. 
8785,3,"Specific recommendations are provided to encourage future mHealth interventionists and investigators to report on representativeness, settings, delivery agents for planned interventions, the extent to which protocol is delivered as intended, and maintenance of effects at the individual or organizational level."
8786,4,For Whom Does It Work? Moderators of Outcome on the Effect of a Transdiagnostic Internet-Based Maintenance Treatment After Inpatient Psychotherapy: Randomized Controlled Trial
8787,0,Recent studies provide evidence for the effectiveness of Internet-based maintenance treatments for mental disorders. 
8788,0,"However, it is still unclear which participants might or might not profit from this particular kind of treatment delivery."
8789,1,"Using data from a randomized controlled trial (N= 400) designed to test the effectiveness of TIMT, we performed secondary analyses to identify factors moderating the effects of TIMT (intervention) when compared with those of a treatment-as-usual control condition. "
8790,1,"TIMT involved an online self-management module, asynchronous patient-therapist communication, a peer support group, and online-based progress monitoring. "
8791,1,"Participants in the control condition had unstructured access to outpatient psychotherapy, standardized outpatient face-to-face continuation treatment, and psychotropic management. "
8792,1,"Self-reports of psychopathological symptoms and potential moderators were assessed at the start of inpatient treatment (T1), at discharge from inpatient treatment/start of TIMT (T2), and at 3-month (T3) and 12-month follow-up (T4)."
8793,2,"Education level, positive outcome expectations, and diagnoses significantly moderated intervention versus control differences regarding changes in outcomes between T2 and T3. "
8794,2,Only education level moderated change differences between T2 and T4. 
8795,2,"The effectiveness of the intervention (vs control) was more pronounced among participants with a low (vs high) education level (T2-T3: B=-0.32, SE 0.16, P=.049; T2-T4: B=-0.42, SE 0.21, P=.049), participants with high (vs low) positive outcome expectations (T2-T3: B=-0.12, SE 0.05, P=.02) and participants with anxiety disorder (vs mood disorder) (T2-T3: B=-0.43, SE 0.21, P=.04). "
8796,2,"Simple slope analyses revealed that despite some subgroups benefiting less from the intervention than others, all subgroups still benefited significantly."
8797,3,"This transdiagnostic Internet-based maintenance treatment might be suitable for a wide range of participants differing in various clinical, motivational, and demographic characteristics. "
8798,3,The treatment is especially effective for participants with low education levels. 
8799,3,These findings may generalize to other Internet-based maintenance treatments.
8800,4,"Internet-Based, Culturally Sensitive, Problem-Solving Therapy for Turkish Migrants With Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial"
8801,0,"Turkish migrants living in the Netherlands have a high prevalence of depressive disorders, but experience considerable obstacles to accessing professional help. "
8802,0,Providing easily accessible Internet treatments may help to overcome these barriers.
8803,1,A two-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted. 
8804,1,"The primary outcome measure was the severity of depressive symptoms; secondary outcome measures were somatic symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, and satisfaction with the treatment. "
8805,1,"Participants were assessed online at baseline, posttest (6 weeks after baseline), and 4 months after baseline. "
8806,1,Posttest results were analyzed on the intention-to-treat sample. 
8807,1,Missing values were estimated by means of multiple imputation. 
8808,1,Differences in clinical outcome between groups were analyzed with a t test. 
8809,1,Cohen's d was used to determine the between-groups effect size at posttreatment and follow-up.
8810,2,Turkish adults (N=96) with depressive symptoms were randomized to the experimental group (n=49) or to a waitlist control group (n=47). 
8811,2,High attrition rates were found among the 96 participants of which 42% (40/96) did not complete the posttest (6 weeks) and 62% (59/96) participants did not complete the follow-up assessment at 4 months. 
8812,2,No significant difference between the experimental group and the control group was found for depression at posttest. 
8813,2,"Recovery occurred significantly more often in the experimental group (33%, 16/49) than in the control group (9%, 4/47) at posttest (P=.02). "
8814,2,"Because of the high attrition rate, a completers-only analysis was conducted at follow-up. "
8815,2,The experimental group showed significant improvement in depression compared to the control group both at posttest (P=.01) and follow-up (P=.01).
8816,3,The results of this study did not show a significant effect on the reduction of depressive symptoms. 
8817,3,"However, the effect size at posttest was high, which might be an indicator of the possible effectiveness of the intervention when assessed in a larger sample and robust trial. "
8818,3,Future research should replicate our study with adequately powered samples.
8819,4,Parents Seeking Health-Related Information on the Internet: Cross-Sectional Study
8820,0,"The Internet represents an increasingly common source of health-related information, and it has facilitated a wide range of interactions between people and the health care delivery system."
8821,1,This cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2012. 
8822,1,The sample consisted of 1544 adults aged >= 18 years selected among parents of public school students in the geographic area of Catanzaro in southern Italy. 
8823,1,A 2-stage sample design was planned. 
8824,1,"A letter summarizing the purpose of the study, an informed consent form, and a questionnaire were given to selected student to deliver to their parents. "
8825,1,"The final survey was formulated in 5 sections: (1) sociodemographic characteristics, (2) information about chronic diseases and main sources of health care information, (3) information about Internet use, (4) data about the effects of using the Internet to search for health information, and (5) knowledge and use of social networks."
8826,2,"A total of 1039 parents completed the questionnaire, with a response rate equivalent to 67.29%. "
8827,2,"Regarding health-related information types, 84.7% of respondents used the Internet to search for their own medical conditions or those of family members or relatives, 40.7% of parents reported looking for diet, body weight, or physical activity information, 29.6% searched for vaccines, 28.5% for screening programs, and 16.5% for smoking cessation tools and products. "
8828,2,"The results of the multiple logistic regression analysis showed that parents who looked for health-related information on the Internet were more likely to be female (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.05-2.25), with a high school diploma (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.02-2.81) or college degree (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.21-3.78), younger aged (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.99), with chronic conditions (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.17-3.19), not satisfied with their general practitioner's health-related information (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.38-0.97), but satisfied with information from scientific journals (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.33-2.98)."
8829,3,Our analyses provide important insights into Internet use and health information-seeking behaviors of the Italian population and contribute to the evidence base for health communication planning. 
8830,3,"Health and public health professionals should educate the public about acquiring health information online and how to critically appraise it, and provide tools to navigate to the highest-quality information. "
8831,3,The challenge to public health practice is to facilitate the health-promoting use of the Web among consumers in conjunction with their health care providers.
8832,4,Using Chat and Text Technologies to Answer Sexual and Reproductive Health Questions: Planned Parenthood Pilot Study
8833,0,"Teens and young adults in the United States are in need of sexual and reproductive health information, as evidenced by elevated rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy, and births among this population. "
8834,0,"In-person sexuality education programs are helpful, but they are unlikely to rapidly accommodate teens and young adults in a moment of crisis. "
8835,0,Evidence suggests that technologies such as instant messaging (IM) and text messaging may be effective ways to provide teens and young adults with sexual and reproductive health information. 
8836,0,"In September 2010, Planned Parenthood Federation of America launched a text and IM program designed to provide immediate answers to urgent sexual and reproductive health questions from a reliable and confidential source and to link young people to sexual and reproductive health services if needed."
8837,1,Data were collected from prechat and postchat surveys for all IM and text message conversations between September 2010 and August 2011. 
8838,1,A bivariate analysis was conducted using chi-square tests for differences in the main covariates by mode of conversation. 
8839,1,"In the multivariable analysis, logistic regression was used to identify factors that were independently associated with prechat levels of worry and changes in worry postchat."
8840,2,"A total of 32,589 conversations occurred during the program's first year. "
8841,2,"The odds of feeling very worried prechat were highest for IM users (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.43, 95% CI 1.20-1.72), users 17 years and younger (AOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.50-1.74), Latino/Hispanic users (AOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.27-1.46), and black users (AOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.30-1.50). "
8842,2,"After controlling for the study covariates, there was no significant difference in the odds of feeling better (less worried) postchat between IM and text message users. "
8843,2,"Feeling better postchat was associated with being younger (<= 17 years: AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.17-1.72; 18-24 years: AOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.42), being Latino/Hispanic (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.10-1.55), reporting that the service was very helpful (AOR 3.47, 95% CI 3.24-4.32), and asking about emergency contraception (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.61). "
8844,2,"The odds of feeling better were lowest for users with questions about STIs (AOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47-0.78)."
8845,3,"The results from the process evaluation suggest that the program was able to provide informational support to vulnerable groups, such as teens and racial minorities, in moments of particular worry. "
8846,3,Differences between the IM and text message users reveal that each mode appeals to a different population and that both are necessary to reach a diverse audience.
8847,4,Effects of Mobile Augmented Reality Learning Compared to Textbook Learning on Medical Students: Randomized Controlled Pilot Study
8848,0,"By adding new levels of experience, mobile Augmented Reality (mAR) can significantly increase the attractiveness of mobile learning applications in medical education."
8849,1,A prestudy was conducted based on a convenience sample of 10 third-year medical students. 
8850,1,"The initial emotional status was captured using the ""Profile of Mood States"" questionnaire (POMS, German variation); previous knowledge about forensic medicine was determined using a 10-item single-choice (SC) test. "
8851,1,"During the 30-minute learning period, the students were randomized into two groups: the first group consisted of pairs of students, each equipped with one iPhone with a preinstalled copy of mARble, while the second group was provided with textbook material. "
8852,1,"Subsequently, both groups were asked to once again complete the POMS questionnaire and SC test to measure changes in emotional state and knowledge gain. "
8853,1,Usability as well as pragmatic and hedonic qualities of the learning material was captured using AttrakDiff2 questionnaires. 
8854,1,Data evaluation was conducted anonymously. 
8855,1,Descriptive statistics for the score in total and the subgroups were calculated before and after the intervention. 
8856,1,The scores of both groups were tested against each other using paired and unpaired signed-rank tests. 
8857,1,An item analysis was performed for the SC test to objectify difficulty and selectivity.
8858,2,"Statistically significant, the mARble group (6/10) showed greater knowledge gain than the control group (4/10) (Wilcoxon z=2.232, P=.03). "
8859,2,The item analysis of the SC test showed a difficulty of P=0.768 (s=0.09) and a selectivity of RPB=0.2. 
8860,2,"For mARble, fatigue (z=2.214, P=.03) and numbness (z=2.07, P=.04) decreased with statistical significance when comparing pre- and post-tests. "
8861,2,"Vigor rose slightly, while irritability did not increase significantly. "
8862,2,Changes in the control group were insignificant. 
8863,2,"Regarding hedonic quality (identification, stimulation, attractiveness), there were significant differences between mARble (mean 1.179, CI -0.440 to 0.440) and the book chapter (mean -0.982, CI -0.959 to 0.959); the pragmatic quality mean only differed slightly."
8864,3,The mARble group performed considerably better regarding learning efficiency; there are hints for activating components of the mAR concept that may serve to fascinate the participants and possibly boost interest in the topic for the remainder of the class. 
8865,3,"While the small sample size reduces our study's conclusiveness, its design seems appropriate for determining the effects of interactive eLearning material with respect to emotions, learning efficiency, and hedonic and pragmatic qualities using a larger group."
8866,4,The Effectiveness of a Web-Based Personalized Feedback and Social Norms Alcohol Intervention on United Kingdom University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial
8867,0,Alcohol consumption in the student population continues to be cause for concern. 
8868,0,"Building on the established evidence base for traditional brief interventions, interventions using the Internet as a mode of delivery are being developed. "
8869,0,Published evidence of replication of initial findings and ongoing development and modification of Web-based personalized feedback interventions for student alcohol use is relatively rare. 
8870,0,The current paper reports on the replication of the initial Unitcheck feasibility trial.
8871,1,A randomized control trial with two arms (control=assessment only; intervention=fully automated personalized feedback delivered using a Web-based intervention). 
8872,1,The intervention was available week 1 through to week 15. 
8873,1,Students at a UK university who were completing a university-wide annual student union electronic survey were invited to participate in the current study. 
8874,1,"Participants (n=1618) were stratified by sex, age group, year of study, self-reported alcohol consumption, then randomly assigned to one of the two arms, and invited to participate in the current trial. "
8875,1,Participants were not blind to allocation. 
8876,1,"In total, n=1478 (n=723 intervention, n=755 control) participants accepted the invitation. "
8877,1,"Of these, 70% were female, the age ranged from 17-50 years old, and 88% were white/white British. "
8878,1,Data were collected electronically via two websites: one for each treatment arm. 
8879,1,"Participants completed assessments at weeks 1, 16, and 34. "
8880,1,"Assessment included CAGE, a 7-day retrospective drinking diary, and drinks consumed per drinking occasion."
8881,2,"The regression model predicted a monitoring effect, with participants who completed assessments reducing alcohol consumption over the final week. "
8882,2,"Further reductions were predicted for those allocated to receive the intervention, and additional reductions were predicted as the number of visits to the intervention website increased."
8883,3,"Unitcheck can reduce the amount of alcohol consumed, and the reduction can be sustained in the medium term (ie, 19 weeks after intervention was withdrawn). "
8884,3,The findings suggest self-monitoring is an active ingredient to Web-based personalized feedback.
8885,4,Tweaking and Tweeting: Exploring Twitter for Nonmedical Use of a Psychostimulant Drug (Adderall) Among College Students
8886,0,Adderall is the most commonly abused prescription stimulant among college students. 
8887,0,"Social media provides a real-time avenue for monitoring public health, specifically for this population."
8888,1,"Public-facing Twitter status messages containing the term ""Adderall"" were monitored from November 2011 to May 2012. "
8889,1,Tweets were examined for mention of side effects and other commonly abused substances. 
8890,1,Tweets from likely students containing GPS data were identified with clusters of nearby colleges and universities for regional comparison.
8891,2,"213,633 tweets from 132,099 unique user accounts mentioned ""Adderall."" The number of Adderall tweets peaked during traditional college and university final exam periods. "
8892,2,Rates of Adderall tweeters were highest among college and university clusters in the northeast and south regions of the United States. 
8893,2,"27,473 (12.9%) mentioned an alternative motive (eg, study aid) in the same tweet. "
8894,2,"The most common substances mentioned with Adderall were alcohol (4.8%) and stimulants (4.7%), and the most common side effects were sleep deprivation (5.0%) and loss of appetite (2.6%)."
8895,3,Twitter posts confirm the use of Adderall as a study aid among college students. 
8896,3,Adderall discussions through social media such as Twitter may contribute to normative behavior regarding its abuse.
8897,4,Internet-Based Photoaging Within Australian Pharmacies to Promote Smoking Cessation: Randomized Controlled Trial
8898,0,Tobacco smoking leads to death or disability and a drain on national resources. 
8899,0,The literature suggests that cigarette smoking continues to be a major modifiable risk factor for a variety of diseases and that smokers aged 18-30 years are relatively resistant to antismoking messages due to their widely held belief that they will not be lifelong smokers.
8900,1,A trial was designed with 80% power based on the effect size observed in a published pilot study; 160 subjects were recruited (80 allocated to the control group and 80 to the intervention group) from 8 metropolitan community pharmacies located around Perth city center in Western Australia. 
8901,1,All participants received standardized smoking cessation advice. 
8902,1,The intervention group participants were also digitally photoaged by using the Internet-based APRIL Face Aging software so they could preview images of themselves as a lifelong smoker and as a nonsmoker. 
8903,1,"Due to the nature of the intervention, the participants and researcher could not be blinded to the study. "
8904,1,"The main outcome measure was quit attempts at 6-month follow-up, both self-reported and biochemically validated through testing for carbon monoxide (CO), and nicotine dependence assessed via the Fagerstrm scale."
8905,2,"At 6-month follow-up, 5 of 80 control group participants (6.3%) suggested they had quit smoking, but only 1 of 80 control group participants (1.3%) consented to, and was confirmed by, CO validation. "
8906,2,"In the intervention group, 22 of 80 participants (27.5%) reported quitting, with 11 of 80 participants (13.8%) confirmed by CO testing. "
8907,2,"This difference in biochemically confirmed quit attempts was statistically significant (chi(2)(1)=9.0, P=.003). "
8908,2,A repeated measures analysis suggested the average intervention group smoking dependence score had also significantly dropped compared to control participants (P<.001). 
8909,2,These differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for small differences in gender distribution and nicotine dependence between the groups. 
8910,2,The mean cost of implementing the intervention was estimated at AU $5.79 per participant. 
8911,2,The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was AU $46 per additional quitter. 
8912,2,The mean cost that participants indicated they were willing to pay for the digital aging service was AU $20.25 (SD 15.32).
8913,3,Demonstrating the detrimental effects on facial physical appearance by using a computer-generated simulation may be both effective and cost-effective at persuading young adult smokers to quit.
8914,4,Development and Testing of a Multidimensional iPhone Pain Assessment Application for Adolescents with Cancer
8915,0,Pain is one of the most common and distressing symptoms reported by adolescents with cancer. 
8916,0,"Despite advancements in pain assessment and management research, pain due to cancer and/ or its treatments continues to be poorly managed. "
8917,0,Our research group has developed a native iPhone application (app) called Pain Squad to tackle the problem of poorly managed pain in the adolescent with cancer group. 
8918,0,"The app functions as an electronic pain diary and is unique in its ability to collect data on pain intensity, duration, location, and the impact pain has on an adolescent's life (ie, relationships, school work, sleep, mood). "
8919,0,It also evaluates medications and other physical and psychological pain management strategies used. 
8920,0,Users are prompted twice daily at configurable times to complete 20 questions characterizing their pain and the app transmits results to a database for aggregate reporting through a Web interface. 
8921,0,"Each diary entry represents a pain case filed by an adolescent with cancer and a reward system ( ie, moving up through law-enforcement team ranks, built-in videotaped acknowledgements from fictitious officers) encourages consistent use of the diary."
8922,1,"We used both low-and high-fidelity qualitative usability testing with qualitative semi-structured, audio-taped interviews and iterative cycles to design and refine the iPhone based Pain Squad app. "
8923,1,Qualitative thematic analysis of interviews using constant comparative methodology captured emergent themes related to app usability. 
8924,1,Content validity was assessed using question importance-rating surveys completed by participants. 
8925,1,Compliance and satisfaction data were collected following a 2-week feasibility trial where users were alarmed to record their pain twice daily on the app.
8926,2,Thematic analysis of usability interviews showed the app to be appealing overall to adolescents. 
8927,2,Analyses of both lowand high-fidelity testing resulted in minor revisions to the app to refine the theme and improve its usability. 
8928,2,Adolescents resoundingly endorsed the game-based nature of the app and its virtual reward system. 
8929,2,The importance of app pain diary questions was established by content validity analysis. 
8930,2,"Compliance with the app, assessed during feasibility testing, was high (mean 81%, SD 22%) and adolescents from this phase of the study found the app likeable, easy to use, and not bothersome to complete."
8931,3,A multifaceted usability approach demonstrated how the Pain Squad app could be made more appealing to children and adolescents with cancer. 
8932,3,The game-based nature and built-in reward system of the app was appealing to adolescents and may have resulted in the high compliance rates and satisfaction ratings observed during clinical feasibility testing.
8933,4,ICDTag: A Prototype for a Web-Based System for Organizing Physician-Written Blog Posts Using a Hybrid Taxonomy-Folksonomy Approach
8934,0,"Medical blogs have emerged as new media, extending to a wider range of medical audiences, including health professionals and patients to share health-related information. "
8935,0,"However, extraction of quality health-related information from medical blogs is challenging primarily because these blogs lack systematic methods to organize their posts. "
8936,0,"Medical blogs can be categorized according to their author into (1) physician-written blogs, (2) nurse-written blogs, and (3) patient-written blogs. "
8937,0,This study focuses on how to organize physician-written blog posts that discuss disease-related issues and how to extract quality information from these posts.
8938,1,"First, the design specifications for the Web-based system were identified. "
8939,1,"This system included two modules: (1) a blogging module that was implemented as one or more blogs, and (2) an aggregator module that aggregated posts from different blogs into an aggregator website. "
8940,1,"We then developed a prototype for this system in which the blogging module included two blogs, the cardiology blog and the gastroenterology blog. "
8941,1,"To analyze the usage patterns of the prototype, we conducted an experiment with data provided by cardiologists and gastroenterologists. "
8942,1,"Next, we conducted two evaluation types: (1) an evaluation of the ICDTag blog, in which the browsing functionalities of the blogging module were evaluated from the end-user's perspective using an online questionnaire, and (2) an evaluation of information quality, in which the quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed from the perspective of medical experts using an emailed questionnaire."
8943,2,Participants of this experiment included 23 cardiologists and 24 gastroenterologists. 
8944,2,Positive evaluations on the main functions and the organization of information on the ICDTag blogs were given by 18 of the participants via an online questionnaire. 
8945,2,These results supported our hypothesis that the use of a taxonomy-folksonomy structure has significant potential to improve the organization of information in physician-written blogs. 
8946,2,The quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed by 3 cardiology experts and 3 gastroenterology experts via an email questionnaire. 
8947,2,The results of this questionnaire demonstrated that the experts considered the aggregated tags and categories semantically related to the posts' content.
8948,3,This study demonstrated that applying the hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach to physician-written blogs that discuss disease-related issues has valuable potential to make these blogs a more organized and systematic medium and supports the extraction of quality information from their posts. 
8949,3,"Thus, it is worthwhile to develop more mature systems that make use of the hybrid approach to organize posts in physician-written blogs. "
8950,4,Periodic Email Prompts to Re-Use an Internet-Delivered Computer-Tailored Lifestyle Program: Influence of Prompt Content and Timing
8951,0,Adherence to Internet-delivered lifestyle interventions using multiple tailoring is suboptimal. 
8952,0,"Therefore, it is essential to invest in proactive strategies, such as periodic email prompts, to boost re-use of the intervention."
8953,1,A sample of municipality employees was invited to participate in the program. 
8954,1,All participants who decided to use the program received an email prompting them to revisit the program. 
8955,1,A 2x3 (content x timing) design was used to test manipulations of prompt content and timing. 
8956,1,"Depending on the study group participants were randomly assigned to, they received either a prompt containing standard content (an invitation to revisit the program), or standard content plus a preview of new content placed on the program website. "
8957,1,"Participants received this prompt after 2, 4, or 6 weeks. "
8958,1,"In addition to these 6 experimental conditions, a control condition was included consisting of participants who did not receive an additional email prompt. "
8959,1,Clicks on the uniform resource locator (URL) provided in the prompt and log-ins to the CT program were objectively monitored. 
8960,1,Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine whether prompt content and/or prompt timing predicted clicking on the URL and logging in to the CT program.
8961,2,"Of all program users (N=240), 206 participants received a subsequent email prompting them to revisit the program. "
8962,2,"A total of 53 participants (25.7%) who received a prompt reacted to this prompt by clicking on the URL, and 25 participants (12.1%) actually logged in to the program. "
8963,2,"There was a main effect of prompt timing; participants receiving an email prompt 2 weeks after their first visit clicked on the URL significantly more often compared with participants that received the prompt after 4 weeks (odds ratio [OR] 3.069, 95% CI 1.392-6.765, P=.005) and after 6 weeks (OR 4.471, 95% CI 1.909-10.471, P=.001). "
8964,2,"Furthermore, participants who received an email prompt 2 weeks after their first visit logged in to the program significantly more often compared to participants receiving the prompt after 6 weeks (OR 16.356, 95% CI 2.071-129.196, P=.008). "
8965,2,A trend was observed with regard to prompt content. 
8966,2,Participants receiving a prompt with additional content were more likely to log in to the program compared to participants who received a standard prompt. 
8967,2,"However, this result was not statistically significant (OR 2.286, 95% CI 0.892-5.856, P=.09)."
8968,3,The key findings suggest that boosting revisits to a CT program benefits most from relatively short prompt timing. 
8969,3,"Furthermore, a preview of new website content may be added to a standard prompt to further increase its effectiveness in persuading people to log in to the program. "
8970,4,Crowdsourced Health Research Studies: An Important Emerging Complement to Clinical Trials in the Public Health Research Ecosystem
8971,0,Crowdsourced health research studies are the nexus of three contemporary trends: 1) citizen science (non-professionally trained individuals conducting science-related activities); 2) crowdsourcing (use of web-based technologies to recruit project participants); and 3) medicine 2.0 /health 2.0 (active participation of individuals in their health care particularly using web 2.0 technologies). 
8972,0,"Crowdsourced health research studies have arisen as a natural extension of the activities of health social networks (online health interest communities), and can be researcher-organized or participant-organized. "
8973,0,"In the last few years, professional researchers have been crowdsourcing cohorts from health social networks for the conduct of traditional studies. "
8974,0,Participants have also begun to organize their own research studies through health social networks and health collaboration communities created especially for the purpose of self-experimentation and the investigation of health-related concerns.
8975,1,Crowdsourced health research studies were identified through a search of literature published from 2000 to 2011 and informal interviews conducted 2008-2011. 
8976,1,Keyword terms related to crowdsourcing were sought in Medline/PubMed. 
8977,1,Papers that presented results from human health studies that included crowdsourced populations were selected for inclusion. 
8978,1,"Crowdsourced health research studies not published in the scientific literature were identified by attending industry conferences and events, interviewing attendees, and reviewing related websites."
8979,2,"Participatory health is a growing area with individuals using health social networks, crowdsourced studies, smartphone health applications, and personal health records to achieve positive outcomes for a variety of health conditions. "
8980,2,"PatientsLikeMe and 23andMe are the leading operators of researcher-organized, crowdsourced health research studies. "
8981,2,"These operators have published findings in the areas of disease research, drug response, user experience in crowdsourced studies, and genetic association. "
8982,2,"Quantified Self, Genomera, and DIYgenomics are communities of participant-organized health research studies where individuals conduct self-experimentation and group studies. "
8983,2,Crowdsourced health research studies have a diversity of intended outcomes and levels of scientific rigor.
8984,3,Participatory health initiatives are becoming part of the public health ecosystem and their rapid growth is facilitated by Internet and social networking influences. 
8985,3,Large-scale parameter-stratified cohorts have potential to facilitate a next-generation understanding of disease and drug response. 
8986,3,"Not only is the large size of crowdsourced cohorts an asset to medical discovery, too is the near-immediate speed at which medical findings might be tested and applied. "
8987,3,Participatory health initiatives are expanding the scope of medicine from a traditional focus on disease cure to a personalized preventive approach. 
8988,3,Crowdsourced health research studies are a promising complement and extension to traditional clinical trials as a model for the conduct of health research.
8989,4,Bias in Online Recruitment and Retention of Racial and Ethnic Minority Men Who Have Sex With Men
8990,0,The Internet has become an increasingly popular venue for men who have sex with men (MSM) to meet potential sex partners. 
8991,0,"Given this rapid increase in online sex-seeking among MSM, Internet-based interventions represent an important HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) prevention strategy. "
8992,0,"Unfortunately, black and Hispanic MSM, who are disproportionately impacted by the HIV epidemic in the United States, have been underrepresented in online research studies."
8993,1,"Internet-using MSM were recruited through banner advertisements on MySpace.com targeted at men who reported in their MySpace profile their age as at least 18 and their sexual orientation as gay, bisexual, or unsure. "
8994,1,Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds stratified by race and ethnicity of the MySpace user clicking through the banner advertisement. 
8995,1,"To characterize survey retention, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models identified factors associated with survey dropout."
8996,2,"Over 30,000 MySpace users clicked on the study banner advertisements (click-through rate of 0.37%, or 30,599 clicks from 8,257,271 impressions). "
8997,2,"Black (0.36% or 6474 clicks from 1,785,088 impressions) and Hispanic (0.35% or 8873 clicks from 2,510,434 impressions) MySpace users had a lower click-through rate compared with white (0.48% or 6995 clicks from 1,464,262 impressions) MySpace users. "
8998,2,"However, black men had increased odds of click-through for advertisements displaying a black model versus a white model (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72 - 1.95), and Hispanic participants had increased odds of click-through when shown an advertisement displaying an Asian model versus a white model (adjusted OR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.62 - 1.79). "
8999,2,"Of the 9005 men who consented to participate, 6258 (69%) completed the entire survey. "
9000,2,"Among participants reporting only male sex partners, black non-Hispanic and Hispanic participants were significantly more likely to drop out of the survey relative to white non-Hispanic participants (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.6, 95% CI 1.4 - 1.8 and HR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 - 1.4, respectively). "
9001,2,"Men with a college-level of education were more likely to complete the survey than those with a high-school level of education (HR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 - 0.9), while men who self-identified as heterosexual were more likely to drop out of the survey compared with men who self-identified as gay (HR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.1 - 3.7)."
9002,3,This analysis identified several factors associated with recruitment and retention of MSM in an online survey. 
9003,3,Differential click-through rates and increased survey dropout by MSM of color indicate that methods to recruit and retain black and Hispanic MSM in Internet-based research studies are paramount. 
9004,3,"Although targeting banner advertisements to MSM of color by changing the racial/ethnic composition of the advertisements may increase click-through, decreasing attrition of these study participants once they are engaged in the survey remains a challenge."
9005,4,The Potential of Web-based Interventions for Heart Disease Self-Management: A Mixed Methods Investigation
9006,0,Existing initiatives to support patient self-management of heart disease do not appear to be reaching patients most in need. 
9007,0,Providing self-management programs over the Internet (web-based interventions) might help reduce health disparities by reaching a greater number of patients. 
9008,0,"However, it is unclear whether they can achieve this goal and whether their effectiveness might be limited by the digital divide."
9009,1,Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to explore use made of a web-based intervention over a period of 9 months. 
9010,1,"Patients with CHD, with or without home Internet access or previous experience using the Internet, were recruited from primary care centers in diverse socioeconomic and ethnic areas of North London, UK. "
9011,1,Patients without home Internet were supported in using the intervention at public Internet services.
9012,2,Only 10.6% of eligible patients chose to participate (N = 168). 
9013,2,"Participants were predominantly Caucasian well-educated men, with greater proportions of male and younger CHD patients among participants than were registered at participating primary care practices. "
9014,2,Most had been diagnosed with CHD a number of years prior to the study. 
9015,2,Relatively few had been newly diagnosed or had experienced a cardiac event in the previous 5 years. 
9016,2,Most had home Internet access and prior experience using the Internet. 
9017,2,"A greater use of the intervention was observed in older participants (for each 5-year age increase, OR 1.25 for no, low or high intervention use, 95% CI, 1.06-1.47) and in those that had home Internet access and prior Internet experience (OR 3.74, 95% CI, 1.52-9.22). "
9018,2,"Less use was observed in participants that had not recently experienced a cardiac event or diagnosis (>= 5 years since cardiac event or diagnosis; OR 0.69, 95% CI, 0.50-0.95). "
9019,2,Gender and level of education were not statistically related to level of use of the intervention. 
9020,2,Data suggest that a recent cardiac event or diagnosis increased the need for information and advice in participants. 
9021,2,"However, participants that had been diagnosed several years ago showed little need for information and support. "
9022,2,The inconvenience of public Internet access was a barrier for participants without home Internet access. 
9023,2,The use of the intervention by participants with little or no Internet experience was limited by a lack of confidence with computers and discomfort with asking for assistance. 
9024,2,It was also influenced by the level of participant need for information and by their perception of the intervention.
9025,3,"The availability of a web-based intervention, with support for use at home or through public Internet services, did not result in a large number or all types of patients with CHD using the intervention for self-management support. "
9026,3,The effectiveness of web-based interventions for patients with chronic diseases remains a significant challenge.
9027,4,"Using the Internet to Promote Health Behavior Change: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Impact of Theoretical Basis, Use of Behavior Change Techniques, and Mode of Delivery on Efficacy"
9028,0,"The Internet is increasingly utilized by researchers, health care providers, and the public to seek medical information. "
9029,0,The Internet also provides a powerful tool for public health messaging. 
9030,0,Understanding the needs of the intended audience and how they use websites is critical for website developers to provide better services to the intended users.
9031,1,"To describe and evaluate Web utilization, we collected Web usage data over an 18-month period and extracted page views, visits, referring domains, and geographic locations. "
9032,1,We used page views as the primary measure for the CFS awareness outreach effort. 
9033,1,We utilized market basket analysis and Markov chain model techniques to describe user behavior related to utilization of campaign materials and continuing medical education courses.
9034,2,"The CDC CFS website received 3,647,736 views from more than 50 countries over the 18-month period and was the 33rd most popular CDC website. "
9035,2,"States with formal Cl, S programs had higher visiting density, such as Washington, DC; Georgia; and New Jersey. "
9036,2,"Most visits (71%) were from Web search engines, with 16% from non-search-engine sites and 12% from visitors who had bookmarked the site. "
9037,2,The public awareness campaign was associated with a sharp increase and subsequent quick drop in Web traffic. 
9038,2,"Following the campaign, user interest shifted from information targeting consumer basic knowledge to information for health care professionals. "
9039,2,The market basket analysis showed that visitors preferred the 60-second radio clip public service announcement over the 30-second one. 
9040,2,Markov chain model results revealed that most visitors took the online continuing education courses in sequential order and were less likely to drop out after they reached the Introduction pages of the courses.
9041,3,The utilization of the CFS website reflects a high level of interest in the illness by visitors to the site. 
9042,3,The high utilization shows the website to be an important online resource for people seeking basic information about CFS and for those looking for professional health care and research information. 
9043,3,Public health programs should consider analytic methods to further public health by understanding the characteristics of those seeking information and by evaluating the outcomes of public health campaigns. 
9044,3,The website was an effective means to provide health information about CFS and serves as an important public health tool for community outreach.
9045,4,Feasibility and Effectiveness of Online Physical Activity Advice Based on a Personal Activity Monitor: Randomized Controlled Trial
9046,0,inactive people are often not aware of the fact that they are insufficiently active. 
9047,0,"Providing insight into their actual physical activity (PA) levels may raise awareness and could, in combination with tailored PA advice, stimulate a physically active lifestyle."
9048,2,"A total of 102 workers, 23 to 39 years old, completed the baseline measurement at the worksite. "
9049,2,"48 completed the 3-month follow up and 38 the 8-month follow-up in the intervention group, 50 completed the 3-month follow up and 42 the 8-month follow up in the control group. "
9050,2,"35 out of 48 (73%) participants in the PAM intervention group reported wearing the PAM regularly, and the PAM COACH was used almost once a week; 24 out of 46 (52%) PAM users set a personal goal, and 33 (72%) entered their favorite activities on the website. "
9051,2,Main reasons for not using these items were lack of interest or not being able to find the item on the website. 
9052,2,"The majority of PAM users (34 out of 46, 74%) read the advice, of whom 14 (39%) found it unappealing. "
9053,2,"After the 3-month intervention, no significant intervention effect was observed (adjusted difference in min/week) for sedentary behavior (beta = 10, 95% CI = -435 to 455), light-intensity PA (beta = -129, 95% CI = -337 to 79), moderate-intensity PA (beta = -13. "
9054,2,"95% CI = -89 to 63), vigorous-intensity PA (beta = -6, 95% CI= -75 to 62), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (beta = -23, 95% CI = -121 to 76). "
9055,2,No significant intervention effect was observed in the PA outcomes at the 8-month follow-up. 
9056,2,"For the determinants of PA, aerobic fitness, and body composition, no statistically significant intervention effect was observed in the total study population immediately after the 3-month intervention or the 8-month follow-up."
9057,3,The intervention appeared to be easily applicable to real-life settings. 
9058,3,The intervention was ineffective in improving PA behavior or its determinants in healthy office workers. 
9059,3,More attention should have been given to the quality and appropriateness of the tailored advice.
9060,1,"Twenty clinicians (seven doctors, nine nurses, two dieticians, and two social welfare officers) from two pediatric diabetes teams participated in the user-centered design of a local Web 2.0 portal. "
9061,1,"After completion of the design, individual semi-structured interviews were performed and data were analyzed using phenomenological methods."
9062,2,The practitioners reported a range of positive attitudes towards the introduction of a local Web 2.0 portal to their clinical practice. 
9063,2,"Most interviewees were satisfied with how the portal turned out, and a sense of community emerged during the design process and development of the portal's contents. "
9064,2,"A complementary role was suggested for the portal within the context of health practice culture, where patients and their parents would be able to learn about the disease before, between, and after scheduled contacts with their health care team. "
9065,2,"Although some professionals expected that email communication with patients and online patient information would save time during routine care, others emphasized the importance of also maintaining face-to-face communication. "
9066,2,"Online peer-to-peer communication was regarded as a valuable function; however, most clinicians did not expect that the portal would be used extensively for social networking amongst their patients. "
9067,2,"There were no major differences in attitudes between different professions or clinics, but some differences appeared in relation to work tasks."
9068,3,Experienced clinical practitioners working in diabetes teams exhibited positive attitudes towards a Web 2.0 portal tailored for young patients with type 1 diabetes and their parents. 
9069,3,"The portal included provision of third-party information, as well as practical and social means of support. "
9070,3,"The practitioners' early and active participation provides a possible explanation for these positive attitudes, The findings encourage close collaboration with all user groups when implementing Web 2.0 systems for the care of young patients with chronic diseases, particularly type 1 diabetes. "
9071,3,"The study also highlights the need for efforts to educate clinical practitioners in the use of Web publishing, social networking, and other Web 2.0 resources. "
9072,3,Investigations of attitudes towards implementing similar systems in the care of adults with chronic diseases are warranted.
9073,4,Facebook for Scientists: Requirements and Services for Optimizing How Scientific Collaborations Are Established
9074,0,"As biomedical research projects become increasingly interdisciplinary and complex, collaboration with appropriate individuals, teams, and institutions becomes ever more crucial to project success. "
9075,0,"While social networks are extremely important in determining how scientific collaborations are formed, social networking technologies have not yet been studied as a tool to help form scientific collaborations. "
9076,0,"Many currently emerging expertise locating systems include social networking technologies, but it is unclear whether they make the process of finding collaborators more efficient and effective."
9077,1,"The background research phase encompassed a thorough review of the literature, affinity diagramming, contextual inquiry, and semistructured interviews. "
9078,1,This phase yielded five themes suggestive of requirements for systems to support the formation of collaborations. 
9079,1,"In the next phase, the generative phase, we brainstormed and selected design ideas for formal concept validation with end users. "
9080,1,"Then, three related, well-validated ideas were selected for implementation and evaluation in a prototype."
9081,2,"Five main themes of systems requirements emerged: (1) beyond expertise, successful collaborations require compatibility with respect to personality, work style, productivity, and many other factors (compatibility); (2) finding appropriate collaborators requires the ability to effectively search in domains other than your own using information that is comprehensive and descriptive (communication); (3) social networks are important for finding potential collaborators, assessing their suitability and compatibility, and establishing contact with them (intermediation); (4) information profiles must be complete, correct, up-to-date, and comprehensive and allow fine-grained control over access to information by different audiences (information quality and access); (5) keeping online profiles up-to-date should require little or no effort and be integrated into the scientist's existing workflow (motivation). "
9082,2,"Based on the requirements, 16 design ideas underwent formal validation with end users. "
9083,2,"Of those, three were chosen to be implemented and evaluated in a system prototype, ""Digital vertical bar Vita"": maintaining, formatting, and semi-automated updating of biographical information; searching for experts; and building and maintaining the social network and managing document flow."
9084,3,"In addition to quantitative and factual information about potential collaborators, social connectedness, personal and professional compatibility, and power differentials also influence whether collaborations are formed. "
9085,3,Current systems only partially model these requirements. 
9086,3,"Services in Digital vertical bar Vita combine an existing workflow, maintaining and formatting biographical information, with collaboration-searching functions in a novel way. "
9087,3,"Several barriers to the adoption of systems such as Digital vertical bar Vita exist, such as potential adoption asymmetries between junior and senior researchers and the tension between public and private information. "
9088,3,Developers and researchers may consider one or more of the services described in this paper for implementation in their own expertise locating systems.
9089,1,A literature search was conducted starting from a previous review and using Medline and Google Scholar. 
9090,1,"Due to the nature of this work and the relative lack of published articles to date, the authors also relied on personal knowledge and experience of systems in use and their own assessments of systems."
9091,2,Functionality for tracking patients and detecting those lost to follow-up is described in six HIV and MDR-TB treatment projects in Africa and Latin America. 
9092,2,"Preliminary data show benefits in tracking patients who have not been prescribed appropriate drugs, those who fail to return for follow-up, and those who do not have medications picked up for them by health care workers. "
9093,2,There were also benefits seen in providing access to key laboratory data and in using this data to improve the timeliness and quality of care. 
9094,2,Follow-up was typically achieved by a combination of reports from information systems along with teams of community health care workers. 
9095,2,"New technologies such as low-cost satellite Internet access, personal digital assistants, and cell phones are helping to expand the reach of these systems."
9096,3,Effective information systems in developing countries are a recent innovation but will need to play an increasing role in supporting and monitoring HIV and MDR-TB projects as they scale up from thousands to hundreds of thousands of patients. 
9097,3,A particular focus should be placed on tracking patients from initial diagnosis to initiation of effective treatment and then monitoring them for treatment breaks or loss to follow-up. 
9098,3,More quantitative evaluations need to be performed on the impact of electronic information systems on tracking patients.
9099,1,Bivariate associations between dependent variables (computer ownership and regular computer use) and independent variables were used to build multivariable logistic models adjusted for age and site clusters.
9100,2,"Participants (N = total weighted size of 2270) were on average 51.0 (+/- 21.4) years old, primarily African American or Hispanic, and earned less than US $20000 per year. "
9101,2,"More than half owned a computer, and 42% were regular computer users. "
9102,2,"Reporting computer ownership was more likely if participants lived above the poverty level (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.39-2.25), completed high school (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.70-3.55), were in financial hardship (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.06-1.81), were employed and supervised others (OR 1.94, 95% CI = 1.08-3.46), and had multiple role responsibilities (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.31-3.61). "
9103,2,"Regular computer use was more likely if participants were non-Hispanic (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.30-2.91), lived above the poverty level (OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.90-4.24), completed high school (OR = 4.43, 95% CI = 3.04-6.46), were employed and supervised others (OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.37-4.22), felt safe in their neighborhood (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.08-2.30), and had greater social network ties (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.26-7.59)."
9104,3,"Disparities in computer ownership and use are narrowing, even among those with very low incomes; however, identifying factors that contribute to disparities in access for these groups will be necessary to ensure the efficacy of future technology-based interventions. "
9105,3,"A unique finding of our study is that it may be equally as important to consider specific social contextual factors when trying to increase access and use among low-income minorities, such as social network ties, household responsibilities, and neighborhood safety."
9106,4,"Comparing the efficacy of two Internet-based, computer-tailored smoking cessation programs: A randomized trial"
9107,0,Online computer-tailored smoking cessation programs have not yet been compared directly.
9108,1,Randomized controlled trial conducted in 2003-2004. 
9109,1,"Visitors to a smoking cessation website were randomly assigned to either an original online, interactive smoking cessation program or to a modified program. "
9110,1,"Both programs consisted of tailored, personalized counseling letters based on participants' characteristics, followed by monthly email reminders. "
9111,1,"The original program was based on psychological and addiction theory, and on preliminary research conducted in the same population. "
9112,1,"The modified program was shorter and contained more information on nicotine replacement therapy and nicotine dependence, and less information on health risks and coping strategies. "
9113,1,"In both programs, 1 month and 2 months after entering the study, participants were invited by email to answer the same tailoring questionnaire again in order to receive a second counseling letter. "
9114,1,"Participants in both programs obtained, on average, 1.2 feedback counseling letters over 2.5 months, and 84% received only 1 feedback letter. "
9115,1,"The outcome was self-reported smoking abstinence (no puff of tobacco in the previous 7 days), assessed 2.5 months after entry in the program. "
9116,1,"We report results from intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, where all non-respondents at follow-up were counted as smokers."
9117,2,"The baseline questionnaire was answered by a total of 11969 current (74%) and former (26%) smokers, and the follow-up survey by 4237 people (35%). "
9118,2,"In an ITT analysis, abstinence rates in baseline current smokers were respectively 10.9% and 8.9% (odds ratio [OR]=1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.08-1.43, P=.003) in the original and modified programs, and 25.2% and 15.7% (OR=1.81, CI 1.51-2.16, P < .001) in baseline former smokers. "
9119,2,"While we found statistically significant differences in quit rates in smokers in the contemplation stage favoring the original program (OR=1.54, CI 1.18-2.02, P=.002), no between-group differences in quit rates were observed in smokers in the precontemplation (OR=1.07, CI 0.36-3.14, P=.91) and preparation (OR=1.15, CI 0.97-1.37,P=.10) stages of change."
9120,3,"In smokers in the contemplation stage of change and in former smokers, the original program produced higher smoking abstinence rates than the modified program."
9121,4,Website quality indicators for consumers
9122,0,The rating tool DISCERN was designed for use by consumers without content expertise to evaluate the quality of health information. 
9123,0,There is some evidence that DISCERN may be a valid indicator of evidence-based website quality when applied by health professionals. 
9124,0,"However, it is not known if the tool is a valid measure of evidence-based quality when used by consumers. "
9125,0,"Since it is a lengthy instrument requiring training in its use, DISCERN may prove impractical for use by the typical consumer. "
9126,0,It is therefore important to explore the validity of other simpler potential indicators of site quality such as Google PageRank.
9127,1,This was a cross-sectional survey of depression websites using consumer and health professional raters. 
9128,1,"The main outcome measures were (1) site characteristics, (2) evidence-based quality of content as measured by evidence-based depression guidelines, (3) DISCERN scores, (4) Google PageRank, and (5) user satisfaction."
9129,2,"There was a significant association between evidence-based quality ratings and average DISCERN ratings both for consumers (r = 0.62, P = .001) and health professionals (r = 0.80, P <.00 1). "
9130,2,"Consumer and health professional DISCERN ratings were significantly correlated (r = 0.77, P <.001). "
9131,2,"The evidence-based quality score correlated with Google PageRank (r = 0.59, P=.002). "
9132,2,"However, the correlation between DISCERN scores and user satisfaction was higher than the correlation between Google PageRank and user satisfaction."
9133,3,DISCERN has potential as an indicator of content quality when used either by experts or by consumers. 
9134,3,Google PageRank shows some promise as an automatic indicator of quality.
9135,4,Comparative case study of two biomedical research collaboratories
9136,0,"Working together efficiently and effectively presents a significant challenge in large-scale, complex, interdisciplinary research projects. "
9137,0,Collaboratories are a nascent method to help meet this challenge. 
9138,0,"However, formal collaboratories in biomedical research centers are the exception rather than the rule."
9139,1,"In each collaboratory, we used semistructured interviews, surveys, and contextual inquiry to assess user needs and define the technology requirements. "
9140,1,We evaluated and selected commercial software applications by comparing their feature sets with requirements and then pilot-testing the applications. 
9141,1,Local and remote support staff cooperated in the implementation and end user training for the collaborative tools. 
9142,1,"Collaboratory staff evaluated each implementation by analyzing utilization data, administering user surveys, and functioning as participant observers."
9143,2,"The HIV/AlDS Center primarily required real-time interaction for developing projects and attracting new participants to the center; the Oral Cancer Center, on the other hand, mainly needed tools to support distributed and asynchronous work in small research groups. "
9144,2,"The HIV/AIDS Center's collaboratory included a center-wide website that also served as the launch point for collaboratory applications, such as NetMeeting, Timbuktu Conference, PlaceWare Auditorium, and iVisit. "
9145,2,The collaboratory of the Oral Cancer Center used Groove and Genesys Web conferencing. 
9146,2,"The HIV/AIDS Center was successful in attracting new scientists to HIV/AIDS research, and members used the collaboratory for developing and implementing new research studies. "
9147,2,"The Oral Cancer Center successfully supported highly distributed and asynchronous research, and the collaboratory facilitated real-time interaction for analyzing data and preparing publications."
9148,3,"The two collaboratory implementations demonstrated the feasibility of supporting biomedical research centers using off-the-shelf commercial tools, but they also identified several barriers to successful collaboration. "
9149,3,"These barriers included computing platform incompatibilities, network infrastructure complexity, variable availability of local versus remote IT support, low computer and collaborative software literacy, and insufficient maturity of available collaborative software. "
9150,3,"Factors enabling collaboratory use included collaboration incentives through funding mechanism, a collaborative versus competitive relationship of researchers, leadership by example, and tools well matched to tasks and technical progress. "
9151,3,"Integrating electronic collaborative tools into routine scientific practice can be successful but requires further research on the technical, social, and behavioral factors influencing the adoption and use of collaboratories."
9152,4,A Web-Based Distance Education Course in Nutrition in Public Health: Case study
9153,0,"Strict work timetables, personal and professional duties or an inability to be absent from home or work can all represent major constraints for those wishing to improve their professional skills. "
9154,0,"Within this context, the World Wide Web can allow people to conveniently follow distance courses from their homes."
9155,1,A Web-based distance education course in nutrition in public health was developed. 
9156,1,The methodology was an adaptation of both problem-based and task-based learning. 
9157,1,"At the end of the course an evaluation questionnaire which covered the course's contents, the educational methodology and resources, the duration and schedule, and the use of the Web as a tool for distance education was given to the students."
9158,2,"There were 83 on line registrations from 13 states, 73 of the applicants were female, 62 had a degree in nutrition and 18 were physicians. "
9159,2,"From these; eleven students from ten states were chosen: nine female nutritionists, two female physicians, and one male physician. "
9160,2,"Seven students completed the course, took and passed the final exam. "
9161,2,"Of the other four students, two failed to follow the schedule, one had health problems, and one did not obtain the minimal score for sitting the final exam. "
9162,2,"The students had a mean age of 35, and a mean of ten years in practice. "
9163,2,"They all stated that they were unable to attend a regular course, even though they felt that they needed to improve their professional skills. "
9164,2,Most of them studied seven days a week for between two and four hours a day. 
9165,2,The students also felt that their professional skills had improved and each reported having made changes in their practice as a result of their participation. 
9166,2,"The students approved of the course's contents, methodology and resources, however they were divided about its duration. "
9167,2,The Web as a tool in distance education was approved by the students. 
9168,2,If it was not for the Web they could not have taken part in a continuing education program. 
9169,2,"All students said they would attend another virtual course, if available. "
9170,2,"Even though most of them did not have difficulty adapting to the virtual environment, they did feel that an adaptation period would be of value."
9171,3,A Web-based course may be more effective than other distance education methodologies because it is more interactive and dynamic. 
9172,3,"On-line material can be constantly reviewed and updated, and the students can have the opportunity to submit commentaries or questions directly to the teaching staff. "
9173,3,A Web-based course also allows the students to go beyond the course content as they learn how to search and take advantage of the huge resources of information available on the Internet.
9174,4,Video Recording Patients for Direct Care Purposes: Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis of International Empirical Studies and UK Professional Guidance
9175,0,Video recordings of patients may offer advantages to supplement patient assessment and clinical decision-making. 
9176,0,"However, little is known about the practice of video recording patients for direct care purposes."
9177,1,"Five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and HMIC) were searched from 2012 to 2022. "
9178,1,"Eligible studies evaluated an intervention involving video recording of adult patients (>= 18 years) to support diagnosis, care, or treatment. "
9179,1,All study designs and countries of publication were included. 
9180,1,Websites of UK professional and regulatory bodies were searched to identify relevant guidance. 
9181,1,The acceptability of video recording patients was evaluated using study recruitment and retention rates and a framework synthesis of patients' and clinical staff's perspectives based on the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability by Sekhon. 
9182,1,Clinically relevant measures of impact were extracted and tabulated according to the study design. 
9183,1,"The framework approach was used to synthesize the reported ethico-legal considerations, and recommendations of professional and regulatory bodies were extracted and tabulated."
9184,2,"Of the 14,221 abstracts screened, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria. "
9185,2,"Overall, 13 guidance documents were retrieved, of which 7 were retained for review. "
9186,2,"The views of patients and clinical staff (16 studies) were predominantly positive, although concerns were expressed about privacy, technical considerations, and integrating video recording into clinical workflows; some patients were anxious about their physical appearance. "
9187,2,"The mean recruitment rate was 68.2% (SD 22.5%; range 34.2%-100%; 12 studies), and the mean retention rate was 73.3% (SD 28.6%; range 16.7%-100%; 17 studies). "
9188,2,"Regarding effectiveness (10 studies), patients and clinical staff considered video recordings to be valuable in supporting assessment, care, and treatment; in promoting patient engagement; and in enhancing communication and recall of information. "
9189,2,"Observational studies (n=5) favored video recording, but randomized controlled trials (n=5) did not demonstrate that video recording was superior to the controls. "
9190,2,"UK guidelines are consistent in their recommendations around consent, privacy, and storage of recordings but lack detailed guidance on how to operationalize these recommendations in clinical practice."
9191,3,"Video recording patients for direct care purposes appears to be acceptable, despite concerns about privacy, technical considerations, and how to incorporate recording into clinical workflows. "
9192,3,"Methodological quality prevents firm conclusions from being drawn; therefore, pragmatic trials (particularly in older adult care and the movement disorders field) should evaluate the impact of video recording on diagnosis, treatment monitoring, patient-clinician communication, and patient safety. "
9193,3,Professional and regulatory documents should signpost to practical guidance on the implementation of video recording in routine practice.
9194,4,Using Hypothesis-Led Machine Learning and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis to Identify Disease Pathways Prior to Dementia: Longitudinal Cohort Study
9195,0,Dementia development is a complex process in which the occurrence and sequential relationships of different diseases or conditions may construct specific patterns leading to incident dementia.
9196,1,"Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, data from 15,700 older people with dementia and 15,700 nondementia controls matched on age, sex, and index year (n=10,466, 67% for the training data set and n=5234, 33% for the testing data set) were retrieved for analysis. "
9197,1,"Using machine learning methods to capture specific hierarchical disease triplet clusters prior to dementia, we designed a study algorithm with four steps: (1) data preprocessing, (2) disease or symptom pathway selection, (3) model construction and optimization, and (4) data visualization."
9198,2,"Among 15,700 identified older people with dementia, 10,466 and 5234 subjects were randomly assigned to the training and testing data sets, and 6215 hierarchical disease triplet clusters with positive correlations with dementia onset were identified. "
9199,2,"We subsequently generated 19,438 features to construct prediction models, and the model with the best performance was support vector machine (SVM) with the by-group LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression method (total corresponding features=2513; accuracy=0.615; sensitivity=0.607; specificity=0.622; positive predictive value=0.612; negative predictive value=0.619; area under the curve=0.639). "
9200,2,"In total, this study captured 49 hierarchical disease triplet clusters related to dementia development, and the most characteristic patterns leading to incident dementia started with cardiovascular conditions (mainly hypertension), cerebrovascular disease, mobility disorders, or infections, followed by neuropsychiatric conditions."
9201,3,"Dementia development in the real world is an intricate process involving various diseases or conditions, their co-occurrence, and sequential relationships. "
9202,3,"Using a machine learning approach, we identified 49 hierarchical disease triplet clusters with leading roles (cardio-or cerebrovascular disease) and supporting roles (mental conditions, locomotion difficulties, infections, and nonspecific neurological conditions) in dementia development. "
9203,3,"Further studies using data from other countries are needed to validate the prediction algorithms for dementia development, allowing the development of comprehensive strategies to prevent or care for dementia in the real world."
9204,4,Effect of a Wearable Device-Based Physical Activity Intervention in North Korean Refugees: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
9205,0,Effective health interventions for North Korean refugees vulnerable to metabolic disorders are currently unelucidated.
9206,1,"We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label study on North Korean refugees aged 19-59 years between June 2020 and October 2021 with a 12-week follow-up period. "
9207,1,The participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group in a 1:1 ratio. 
9208,1,"The intervention group received individualized health counseling based on Fitbit data every 4 weeks, whereas the control group wore the Fitbit device but did not receive individualized counseling. "
9209,1,"The primary and secondary outcomes were the change in the mean daily step count and changes in the metabolic parameters, respectively."
9210,2,"The trial was completed by 52 North Korean refugees, of whom 27 and 25 were in the intervention and control groups, respectively. "
9211,2,"The mean age was 43 (SD 10) years, and 41 (78.8%) participants were women. "
9212,2,"Most participants (44/52, 95.7%) had a low socioeconomic status. "
9213,2,"After the intervention, the daily step count in the intervention group increased, whereas that in the control group decreased. "
9214,2,"However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups (+83 and -521 steps in the intervention and control groups, respectively; P=.500). "
9215,2,"The effects of the intervention were more prominent in the participants with a lower-than-average daily step count at baseline (<11,667 steps/day). "
9216,2,"After the 12-week study period, 85.7% (12/14) and 46.7% (7/15) of the participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively, had an increased daily step count (P=.05). "
9217,2,"The intervention prevented the worsening of the metabolic parameters, including BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose level, and glycated hemoglobin level, during the study period."
9218,3,The wearable device-based physical activity intervention did not significantly increase the average daily step count in the North Korean refugees in this study. 
9219,3,"However, the intervention was effective among the North Korean refugees with a lower-than-average daily step count; therefore, a large-scale, long-term study of this intervention type in an underserved population is warranted."
9220,4,"Scope, Characteristics, Behavior Change Techniques, and Quality of Conversational Agents for Mental Health and Well-Being: Systematic Assessment of Apps"
9221,0,Mental disorders cause substantial health-related burden worldwide. 
9222,0,"Mobile health interventions are increasingly being used to promote mental health and well-being, as they could improve access to treatment and reduce associated costs. "
9223,0,Behavior change is an important feature of interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being. 
9224,0,There is a need to discern the active components that can promote behavior change in such interventions and ultimately improve users' mental health.
9225,1,"The search, selection, and assessment of apps were adapted from a systematic review methodology and included a search, 2 rounds of selection, and an evaluation following predefined criteria. "
9226,1,We conducted a systematic app search of Apple's App Store and Google Play using 42matters. 
9227,1,Apps with CAs in English that uploaded or updated from January 2020 and provided interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being and the assessment or management of mental disorders were tested by at least 2 reviewers. 
9228,1,"The BCT taxonomy v1, a comprehensive list of 93 BCTs, was used to identify the specific behavior change components in CAs."
9229,2,We found 18 app-based mental health CAs. 
9230,2,"Most CAs had <1000 user ratings on both app stores (12/18, 67%) and targeted several conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression (13/18, 72%). "
9231,2,All CAs addressed >1 mental disorder. 
9232,2,"Most CAs (14/18, 78%) used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). "
9233,2,"Half (9/18, 50%) of the CAs identified were rule based (ie, only offered predetermined answers) and the other half (9/18, 50%) were artificial intelligence enhanced (ie, included open-ended questions). "
9234,2,CAs used 48 different BCTs and included on average 15 (SD 8.77; range 4-30) BCTs. 
9235,2,"The most common BCTs were 3.3 ""Social support (emotional),"" 4.1 ""Instructions for how to perform a behavior,"" 11.2 ""Reduce negative emotions,"" and 6.1 ""Demonstration of the behavior."" One-third (5/14, 36%) of the CAs claiming to be CBT based did not include core CBT concepts."
9236,3,"Mental health CAs mostly targeted various mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression, reflecting a broad intervention focus. "
9237,3,The most common BCTs identified serve to promote the self-management of mental disorders with few therapeutic elements. 
9238,3,"CA developers should consider the quality of information, user confidentiality, access, and emergency management when designing mental health CAs. "
9239,3,"Future research should assess the role of artificial intelligence in promoting behavior change within CAs and determine the choice of BCTs in evidence-based psychotherapies to enable systematic, consistent, and transparent development and evaluation of effective digital mental health interventions."
9240,4,Investigating the Role of Nutrition in Enhancing Immunity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Twitter Text-Mining Analysis
9241,0,The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the spotlight the critical role played by a balanced and healthy diet in bolstering the human immune system. 
9242,0,There is burgeoning interest in nutrition-related information on social media platforms like Twitter. 
9243,0,"There is a critical need to assess and understand public opinion, attitudes, and sentiments toward nutrition-related information shared on Twitter."
9244,1,"We gathered 71,178 nutrition-related tweets that were posted between January 01, 2020, and September 30, 2020. "
9245,1,The Correlated Explanation text mining algorithm was used to identify frequently discussed topics that users mentioned as contributing to immunity building against SARS-CoV-2. 
9246,1,We assessed the relative importance of these topics and performed a sentiment analysis. 
9247,1,We also qualitatively examined the tweets to gain a closer understanding of nutrition-related topics and food groups.
9248,2,"Text-mining yielded 10 topics that users discussed frequently on Twitter, viz proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy-related, spices and herbs, fluids, supplements, avoidable foods, and specialty diets. "
9249,2,"Supplements were the most frequently discussed topic (23,913/71,178, 33.6%) with a higher proportion (20,935/23,913, 87.75%) exhibiting a positive sentiment with a score of 0.41. "
9250,2,"Consuming fluids (17,685/71,178, 24.85%) and fruits (14,807/71,178, 20.80%) were the second and third most frequent topics with favorable, positive sentiments. "
9251,2,"Spices and herbs (8719/71,178, 12.25%) and avoidable foods (8619/71,178, 12.11%) were also frequently discussed. "
9252,2,"Negative sentiments were observed for a higher proportion of avoidable foods (7627/8619, 84.31%) with a sentiment score of -0.39."
9253,3,This study identified 10 important food groups and associated sentiments that users discussed as a means to improve immunity. 
9254,3,Our findings can help dieticians and nutritionists to frame appropriate interventions and diet programs.
9255,4,Linguistic Methodologies to Surveil the Leading Causes of Mortality: Scoping Review of Twitter for Public Health Data
9256,0,Twitter has become a dominant source of public health data and a widely used method to investigate and understand public health-related issues internationally. 
9257,0,"By leveraging big data methodologies to mine Twitter for health-related data at the individual and community levels, scientists can use the data as a rapid and less expensive source for both epidemiological surveillance and studies on human behavior. "
9258,0,"However, limited reviews have focused on novel applications of language analyses that examine human health and behavior and the surveillance of several emerging diseases, chronic conditions, and risky behaviors."
9259,1,"A literature search strategy following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extended guidelines for scoping reviews was used to search specific keywords on Twitter and public health on 5 databases: Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. "
9260,1,We reviewed the literature comprising peer-reviewed empirical research articles that included original research published in English-language journals between 2008 and 2021. 
9261,1,Key information on Twitter data being leveraged for analyzing user language to study physical and mental health and public health surveillance was extracted.
9262,2,A total of 38 articles that focused primarily on Twitter as a data source met the inclusion criteria for review. 
9263,2,"In total, two themes emerged from the literature: (1) language analysis to identify health threats and physical and mental health understandings about people and societies and (2) public health surveillance related to leading causes of mortality, primarily representing 3 categories (ie, respiratory infections, cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19). "
9264,2,"The findings suggest that Twitter language data can be mined to detect mental health conditions, disease surveillance, and death rates; identify heart-related content; show how health-related information is shared and discussed; and provide access to users' opinions and feelings."
9265,3,Twitter analysis shows promise in the field of public health communication and surveillance. 
9266,3,It may be essential to use Twitter to supplement more conventional public health surveillance approaches. 
9267,3,Twitter can potentially fortify researchers' ability to collect data in a timely way and improve the early identification of potential health threats. 
9268,3,Twitter can also help identify subtle signals in language for understanding physical and mental health conditions.
9269,4,Development of Indirect Health Data Linkage on Health Product Use and Care Trajectories in France: Systematic Review
9270,0,"European national disparities in the integration of data linkage (ie, being able to match patient data between databases) into routine public health activities were recently highlighted. "
9271,0,"In France, the claims database covers almost the whole population from birth to death, offering a great research potential for data linkage. "
9272,0,"As the use of a common unique identifier to directly link personal data is often limited, linkage with a set of indirect key identifiers has been developed, which is associated with the linkage quality challenge to minimize errors in linked data."
9273,1,"A comprehensive search for all papers published in PubMed/Medline and Embase databases up to December 31, 2022, involving linked French database focusing on health products use or care trajectories was realized. "
9274,1,"Only studies based on the use of indirect identifiers were included (ie, without a unique personal identifier available to easily link the databases). "
9275,1,A descriptive analysis of data linkage with quality indicators and adherence to the Bohensky framework for evaluating data linkage studies was also realized.
9276,2,"In total, 16 papers were selected. "
9277,2,Data linkage was performed at the national level in 7 (43.8%) cases or at the local level in 9 (56.2%) studies. 
9278,2,"The number of patients included in the different databases and resulting from data linkage varied greatly, respectively, from 713 to 75,000 patients and from 210 to 31,000 linked patients. "
9279,2,The diseases studied were mainly chronic diseases and infections. 
9280,2,"The objectives of the data linkage were multiple: to estimate the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs; n=6, 37.5%), to reconstruct the patient's care trajectory (n=5, 31.3%), to describe therapeutic uses (n=2, 12.5%), to evaluate the benefits of treatments (n=2, 12.5%), and to evaluate treatment adherence (n=1, 6.3%). "
9281,2,Registries are the most frequently linked databases with French claims data. 
9282,2,"No studies have looked at linking with a hospital data warehouse, a clinical trial database, or patient self-reported databases. "
9283,2,"The linkage approach was deterministic in 7 (43.8%) studies, probabilistic in 4 (25.0%) studies, and not specified in 5 (31.3%) studies. "
9284,2,"The linkage rate was mainly from 80% to 90% (reported in 11/15, 73.3%, studies). "
9285,2,Adherence to the Bohensky framework for evaluating data linkage studies showed that the description of the source databases for the linkage was always performed but that the completion rate and accuracy of the variables to be linked were not systematically described.
9286,3,This review highlights the growing interest in health data linkage in France. 
9287,3,"Nevertheless, regulatory, technical, and human constraints remain major obstacles to their deployment. "
9288,3,"The volume, variety, and validity of the data represent a real challenge, and advanced expertise and skills in statistical analysis and artificial intelligence are required to treat these big data."
9289,4,"Efficacy of Web-Based, Guided Self-help Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Enhanced for Binge Eating Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial"
9290,0,"Owing to the gap between treatment supply and demand, there are long waiting periods for patients with binge eating disorder, and there is an urgent need to increase their access to specialized treatment. "
9291,0,Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy-enhanced (CBT-E) may have great advantages for patients if its efficacy can be established.
9292,1,A single-blind 2-arm randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate guided self-help CBT-E according to an intention-to-treat analysis. 
9293,1,"A total of 180 patients were randomly assigned to guided self-help CBT-E (n=90, 50%) or the delayed-treatment control condition (n=90, 50%) for which guided self-help CBT-E was provided after the initial 12-week delay. "
9294,1,The primary outcome was reduction in binges. 
9295,1,"The secondary outcome was full recovery at the end of treatment, as measured using the Eating Disorder Examination during the last 4 weeks of treatment. "
9296,1,A linear mixed model analysis was performed to compare treatment outcomes at the end of treatment. 
9297,1,A second linear mixed model analysis was performed to measure between and within-group effects for up to 24 weeks of follow-up. 
9298,1,The Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire and clinical impairment assessment were conducted before and after treatment and during follow-up. 
9299,1,"In addition, dropout rates were assessed in both conditions."
9300,2,"During the last 4 weeks of treatment, objective binges reduced from an average of 19 (SD 16) to 3 (SD 5) binges, and 40% (36/90) showed full recovery in the guided self-help CBT-E group. "
9301,2,Between-group effect size (Cohen d) was 1.0 for objective binges. 
9302,2,"At follow-up, after both groups received treatment, there was no longer a difference between the groups. "
9303,2,"Of the 180 participants, 142 (78.9%) completed treatment. "
9304,2,"The overall treatment dropout appeared to be associated with gender, level of education, and number of objective binges at baseline but not with treatment condition."
9305,3,This is the first study to investigate the efficacy of guided self-help CBT-E. 
9306,3,Guided self-help CBT-E appeared to be an efficacious treatment. 
9307,3,This study's findings underscore the international guidelines recommending this type of treatment for binge eating disorder.
9308,4,Users Reactions to Announced Vaccines Against COVID-19 Before Marketing in France: Analysis of Twitter Posts
9309,0,"Within a few months, the COVID-19 pandemic had spread to many countries , had been a real challenge for health systems all around the world. "
9310,0,This unprecedented crisis has led to a surge of online discussions about potential cures for the disease. 
9311,0,"Among them, vaccines have been at the heart of the debates and have faced lack of confidence before marketing in France."
9312,1,This study was conducted in 2 phases. 
9313,1,"First, we filtered a collection of tweets related to COVID-19 available on Twitter from February 2020 to August 2020 with a set of keywords associated with vaccine mistrust using word embeddings. "
9314,1,"Second, we performed sentiment analysis using deep learning to identify the characteristics of vaccine mistrust. "
9315,1,The model was trained on a hand-labeled subset of 4548 tweets.
9316,2,"A set of 69 relevant keywords were identified as the semantic concept of the word ""vaccin"" (vaccine in French) and focused mainly on conspiracies, pharmaceutical companies , alternative treatments. "
9317,2,"Those keywords enabled us to extract nearly 350,000 tweets in French. "
9318,2,The sentiment analysis model achieved 0.75 accuracy. 
9319,2,"The model then predicted 16% of positive tweets, 41% of negative tweets, and 43% of neutral tweets. "
9320,2,This allowed us to explore the semantic concepts of positive and negative tweets and to plot the trends of each sentiment. 
9321,2,The main negative rhetoric identified from users' tweets was that vaccines are perceived as having a political purpose and that COVID-19 is a commercial argument for the pharmaceutical companies.
9322,3,Twitter might be a useful tool to investigate the arguments for vaccine mistrust because it unveils political criticism contrasting with the usual concerns on adverse drug reactions. 
9323,3,"As the opposition rhetoric is more consistent and more widely spread than the positive rhetoric, we believe that this research provides effective tools to help health authorities better characterize the risk of vaccine mistrust."
9324,4,Safety Concerns in Mobility-Assistive Products for Older Adults: Content Analysis of Online Reviews
9325,0,Older adults who have difficulty moving around are commonly advised to adopt mobility-assistive devices to prevent injuries. 
9326,0,"However, limited evidence exists on the safety of these devices. "
9327,0,"Existing data sources such as the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System tend to focus on injury description rather than the underlying context, thus providing little to no actionable information regarding the safety of these devices. "
9328,0,"Although online reviews are often used by consumers to assess the safety of products, prior studies have not explored consumer-reported injuries and safety concerns within online reviews of mobility-assistive devices."
9329,1,"Reviews concerning assistive devices were extracted from the ""assistive aid"" categories, which are typically intended for older adult use, on Amazon's US website. "
9330,1,"The extracted reviews were filtered so that only those pertaining to mobility-assistive devices (canes, gait or transfer belts, ramps, walkers or rollators, and wheelchairs or transport chairs) were retained. "
9331,1,"We conducted large-scale content analysis of these 48,886 retained reviews by coding them according to injury type (no injury, potential future injury, minor injury, and major injury) and injury pathway (device critical component breakage or decoupling; unintended movement; instability; poor, uneven surface handling; and trip hazards). "
9332,1,"Coding efforts were carried out across 2 separate phases in which the team manually verified all instances coded as minor injury, major injury, or potential future injury and established interrater reliability to validate coding efforts."
9333,2,"The content analysis provided a better understanding of the contexts and conditions leading to user injury, as well as the severity of injuries associated with these mobility-assistive devices. "
9334,2,"Injury pathways-device critical component failures; unintended device movement; poor, uneven surface handling; instability; and trip hazards-were identified for 5 product types (canes, gait and transfer belts, ramps, walkers and rollators, and wheelchairs and transport chairs). "
9335,2,"Outcomes were normalized per 10,000 posting counts (online reviews) mentioning minor injury, major injury, or potential future injury by product category. "
9336,2,"Overall, per 10,000 reviews, 240 (2.4%) described mobility-assistive equipment-related user injuries, whereas 2318 (23.18%) revealed potential future injuries."
9337,3,"This study highlights mobility-assistive device injury contexts and severities, suggesting that consumers who posted online reviews attribute most serious injuries to a defective item, rather than user misuse. "
9338,3,It implies that many mobility-assistive device injuries may be preventable through patient and caregiver education on how to evaluate new and existing equipment for risk of potential future injury.
9339,4,Automated Sleep Stages Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network From Raw and Time-Frequency Electroencephalogram Signals: Systematic Evaluation Study
9340,0,"Most existing automated sleep staging methods rely on multimodal data, and scoring a specific epoch requires not only the current epoch but also a sequence of consecutive epochs that precede and follow the epoch."
9341,1,"SleepInceptionNet is based on our systematic evaluation of the effects of different EEG preprocessing methods, EEG channels, and convolutional neural networks on automatic sleep staging performance. "
9342,1,"The evaluation was performed using polysomnography data of 883 participants (937,975 thirty-second epochs). "
9343,1,"Raw data of individual EEG channels (ie, frontal, central, and occipital) and 3 specific transformations of the data, including power spectral density, continuous wavelet transform, and short-time Fourier transform, were used separately as the inputs of the convolutional neural network models. "
9344,1,"To classify sleep stages, 7 sequential deep neural networks were tested for the 1D data (ie, raw EEG and power spectral density), and 16 image classifier convolutional neural networks were tested for the 2D data (ie, continuous wavelet transform and short-time Fourier transform time-frequency images)."
9345,2,"The best model, SleepInceptionNet, which uses time-frequency images developed by the continuous wavelet transform method from central single-channel EEG data as input to the InceptionV3 image classifier algorithm, achieved a Cohen kappa agreement of 0.705 (SD 0.077) in reference to the gold standard polysomnography."
9346,3,"SleepInceptionNet may allow real-time automated sleep staging in free-living conditions using a single-channel EEG, which may be useful for on-demand intervention or treatment during specific sleep stages."
9347,4,Web-Based Interventions for Pregnant Women With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
9348,0,"Effective management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is essential because it is one of the most prevalent diseases during pregnancy, and the consequent condition maternal hyperglycemia is closely related to considerable short- and long-term maternal and neonatal complications. "
9349,0,"Web-based interventions (WBIs), defined as therapeutic interventions offered via the web, have been implemented to assist in managing GDM owing to their advantages of high accessibility and efficiency, but findings across relevant studies are inconsistent."
9350,1,"PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched from their respective inception to November 19, 2022, to identify relevant randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. "
9351,1,The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. 
9352,1,"Where possible, the data for all outcomes were meta-analyzed using the Stata software (version 12.0; StataCorp). "
9353,1,"Overall, 3 subgroup analyses and post hoc sensitivity analyses of maternal glycemic control parameters were performed."
9354,2,"Overall, 25 publications arising from 21 randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were included. "
9355,2,"The overall meta-analyses on glycemic control parameters demonstrated that WBIs could significantly improve fasting blood glucose (standardized mean difference=-1.764, 95% CI -2.972 to -0.557; P=.004) and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (standardized mean difference=-1.433, 95% CI -2.561 to -0.304; P=.01) compared with the control group, whereas no significant effect was found on glycated hemoglobin and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose. "
9356,2,The results of the subgroup analyses indicated that mobile app-delivered interventions with a personalized format and interactive function showed more beneficial effects on maternal glycemic control. 
9357,2,"Moreover, WBIs could significantly enhance compliance with the self-monitoring of blood glucose; increase the rate of normal vaginal delivery; and decrease the chance of emergency cesarean, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and composite neonatal complications. "
9358,2,"GDM knowledge, risk perception of the disease, self-efficacy, satisfaction with care, and medical service use of the participants in the WBI group were also improved compared with the control group. "
9359,2,"However, the effectiveness of WBIs on other secondary outcomes was either nonsignificant or uncertain."
9360,3,WBIs are a promising approach to GDM management. 
9361,3,"Personalized, interactive, and mobile app-delivered interventions seem more worthy of being recommended for future clinical practice. "
9362,3,Further high-quality studies are required to verify these findings before making broad recommendations.
9363,4,Accuracy and Systematic Biases of Heart Rate Measurements by Consumer-Grade Fitness Trackers in Postoperative Patients: Prospective Clinical Trial
9364,0,"Over the recent years, technological advances of wrist-worn fitness trackers heralded a new era in the continuous monitoring of vital signs. "
9365,0,"So far, these devices have primarily been used for sports."
9366,1,"We conducted a prospective validation study with 201 patients after moderate to major surgery in a controlled setting to benchmark the accuracy of heart rate measurements in 4 consumer-grade fitness trackers (Apple Watch 7, Garmin Fenix 6 Pro, Withings ScanWatch, and Fitbit Sense) against the clinical gold standard (electrocardiography)."
9367,2,"All devices exhibited high correlation (r >= 0.95; P<.001) and concordance (r(c)>= 0.94) coefficients, with a relative error as low as mean absolute percentage error <5% based on 1630 valid measurements. "
9368,2,"We identified confounders significantly biasing the measurement accuracy, although not at clinically relevant levels (mean absolute error<5 beats per minute)."
9369,3,Consumer-grade fitness trackers appear promising in hospitalized patients for monitoring heart rate.
9370,4,Model for Predicting In-Hospital Mortality of Physical Trauma Patients Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques: Nationwide Population-Based Study in Korea
9371,0,Physical trauma-related mortality places a heavy burden on society. 
9372,0,Estimating the mortality risk in physical trauma patients is crucial to enhance treatment efficiency and reduce this burden. 
9373,0,"The most popular and accurate model is the Injury Severity Score (ISS), which is based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), an anatomical injury severity scoring system. "
9374,0,"However, the AIS requires specialists to code the injury scale by reviewing a patient's medical record; therefore, applying the model to every hospital is impossible."
9375,1,"We used the Korean National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) data set (N=778,111) compiled from over 400 hospitals between 2016 and 2019. "
9376,1,"To predict in-hospital mortality, we used the following as input features: ICD-10, patient age, gender, intentionality, injury mechanism, and emergent symptom, Alert/Verbal/Painful/Unresponsive (AVPU) scale, Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS), and procedure codes. "
9377,1,"We proposed the ensemble of deep neural networks (EDNN) via 5-fold cross-validation and compared them with other state-of-the-art machine learning models, including traditional prediction models. "
9378,1,We further investigated the effect of the features.
9379,2,"Our proposed EDNN with all features provided the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.9507, outperforming other state-of-the-art models, including the following traditional prediction models: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost; AUROC of 0.9433), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost; AUROC of 0.9331), ICD-based ISS (AUROC of 0.8699 for an inclusive model and AUROC of 0.8224 for an exclusive model), and KTAS (AUROC of 0.1841). "
9380,2,"In addition, using all features yielded a higher AUROC than any other partial features, namely, EDNN with the features of ICD-10 only (AUROC of 0.8964) and EDNN with the features excluding ICD-10 (AUROC of 0.9383)."
9381,3,"Our proposed EDNN with all features outperforms other state-of-the-art models, including the traditional diagnostic code-based prediction model and triage scale."
9382,4,Psychometric Properties of the Chinese Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale in Medical Staff: Cross-sectional Study
9383,0,"Worldwide, mental well-being is a critical issue for public health, especially among medical staff; it affects professionalism, efficiency, quality of care delivery, and overall quality of life. "
9384,0,"Nevertheless, assessing mental well-being is a complex problem."
9385,1,"A cross-sectional online survey was conducted of medical staff from 15 provinces in China from May 15 to July 15, 2020. "
9386,1,Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test the structure of the Chinese WEMWBS. 
9387,1,The Spearman correlations of the Chinese WEMWBS with the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) were used to evaluate convergent validity. 
9388,1,The Cronbach alpha and split-half reliability (lambda) represented internal consistency. 
9389,1,A graded response model was adopted for an item response theory (IRT) analysis. 
9390,1,"We report discrimination, difficulty, item characteristic curves (ICCs), and item information curves (IICs). "
9391,1,ICCs and IICs were used to estimate reliability and validity based on the IRT analysis.
9392,2,A total of 572 participants from 15 provinces in China finished the Chinese WEMWBS. 
9393,2,"The CFA showed that the 1D model was satisfactory and internal consistency reliability was excellent, with alpha=.965 and lambda=0.947, while the item-scale correlation coefficients ranged from r=0.727 to r=0.900. "
9394,2,"The correlation coefficient between the Chinese WEMWBS and the WHO-5 was significant, at r=0.746. "
9395,2,"The average variance extraction value was 0.656, and the composite reliability value was 0.964, with good aggregation validity. "
9396,2,The discrimination of the Chinese WEMWBS items ranged from 2.026 to 5.098. 
9397,2,The ICCs illustrated that the orders of the category thresholds for the 14 items were satisfactory.
9398,3,The Chinese WEMWBS showed good psychometric properties and can measure well-being in medical staff.
9399,4,eHealth in Care Coordination for Older Adults Living at Home: Scoping Review
9400,0,"The population of older adults is projected to increase, potentially resulting in more older adults living with chronic illnesses or multimorbidity. "
9401,0,Living with chronic illnesses increases the need for coordinated health care services. 
9402,0,"Older adults want to manage their illnesses themselves, and many are positive about using eHealth for care coordination (CC). "
9403,0,CC can help older adults navigate the health care system and improve information sharing.
9404,1,We used a scoping review methodology. 
9405,1,"We searched four databases-MEDLINE, CINAHL, Academic Scoping Premier, and Scopus-from 2009 to 2021 for research articles. "
9406,1,"We screened 630 records using the inclusion criteria (older adults aged >65 years, primary health care setting, description of an eHealth program or intervention or measure or experiences with the use of eHealth, and inclusion of CC or relevant activities as described in the Care Coordination Atlas). "
9407,1,The analysis of the included articles consisted of both a descriptive and thematic analysis.
9408,2,A total of 16 studies were included in this scoping review. 
9409,2,"Of these 16 studies, 12 (75%) had a quantitative design, and the samples of the included studies varied in size. "
9410,2,"The categories of eHealth used for CC among older adults living at home were electronic health records and patient portals, telehealth monitoring solutions, and telephone only. "
9411,2,"The CC activity communication was evident in all studies (16/16, 100%). "
9412,2,"The results on patient-and system-level outcomes were mixed; however, most studies (7/16, 44%) reported improved mental and physical health and reduced rehospitalization and hospital admission rates. "
9413,2,Observing changes in patients' health was a facilitator for health care professionals using eHealth in CC. 
9414,2,"When using eHealth in CC, available support to the patient, personal continuity, and a sense of security and safety were facilitators for older adults. "
9415,2,"Individual characteristics and lack of experience, confidence, and knowledge were barriers to older adults' use of eHealth. "
9416,2,Health care professionals reported barriers such as increased workload and hampered communication.
9417,3,We mapped the research literature on eHealth-enabled CC for older adults living at home. 
9418,3,We did not map the gray literature as we aimed to map the research literature (peer-reviewed research articles published in academic journals). 
9419,3,The study results showed that using eHealth to coordinate care for older adults who live at home is promising. 
9420,3,"To ensure the successful use of eHealth in CC, we recommend customized eHealth-enabled health care services for older adults, including individualized education and support."
9421,4,Emotions and Topics Expressed on Twitter During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Kingdom: Comparative Geolocation and Text Mining Analysis
9422,0,"In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought great changes to public health, society, and the economy. "
9423,0,"Social media provide a platform for people to discuss health concerns, living conditions, and policies during the epidemic, allowing policymakers to use this content to analyze the public emotions and attitudes for decision-making."
9424,1,"Over 500,000 tweets related to COVID-19 from 48 different cities in the United Kingdom were extracted, with the data covering the period of the last 2 years (from February 2020 to November 2021). "
9425,1,"We leveraged three advanced deep learning-based models for topic modeling to geospatially analyze the sentiment, emotion, and topics of tweets in the United Kingdom: SenticNet 6 for sentiment analysis, SpanEmo for emotion recognition, and combined topic modeling (CTM)."
9426,2,We observed a significant change in the number of tweets as the epidemiological situation and vaccination situation shifted over the 2 years. 
9427,2,There was a sharp increase in the number of tweets from January 2020 to February 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. 
9428,2,"Then, the number of tweets gradually declined as of February 2020. "
9429,2,"Moreover, with identification of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in the United Kingdom in November 2021, the number of tweets grew again. "
9430,2,Our findings reveal people's attitudes and emotions toward topics related to COVID-19. 
9431,2,"For sentiment, approximately 60% of tweets were positive, 20% were neutral, and 20% were negative. "
9432,2,"For emotion, people tended to express highly positive emotions in the beginning of 2020, while expressing highly negative emotions over time toward the end of 2021. "
9433,2,The topics also changed during the pandemic.
9434,3,"Through large-scale text mining of Twitter, our study found meaningful differences in public emotions and topics regarding the COVID-19 pandemic among different UK cities. "
9435,3,"Furthermore, efficient location-based and time-based comparative analysis can be used to track people's thoughts and feelings, and to understand their behaviors. "
9436,3,"Based on our analysis, positive attitudes were common during the pandemic; optimism and anticipation were the dominant emotions. "
9437,3,"With the outbreak and epidemiological change, the government developed control measures and vaccination policies, and the topics also shifted over time. "
9438,3,"Overall, the proportion and expressions of emojis, sentiments, emotions, and topics varied geographically and temporally. "
9439,3,"Therefore, our approach of exploring public emotions and topics on the pandemic from Twitter can potentially lead to informing how public policies are received in a particular geographical area."
9440,4,Quality Assessment of Hypertension Treatment-Related Information on WeChat: Cross-sectional Study
9441,0,The WeChat platform has become a primary source for medical information in China. 
9442,0,"However, no study has been conducted to explore the quality of information on WeChat for the treatment of hypertension, the leading chronic condition."
9443,1,We searched for all information related to hypertension treatment on WeChat based on several inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
9444,1,"We used 2 tools to evaluate information quality, and 2 independent reviewers performed the assessment with the 2 tools separately. "
9445,1,"First, we adopted the DISCERN instrument to assess the credibility and concreteness of the treatment information, with the outcomes classified into five grades: excellent, good, fair, poor, and very poor. "
9446,1,"Second, we applied the Chinese Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension (2018 edition) to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the article information with regard to specific medical content. "
9447,1,"Third, we combined the results from the 2 assessments to arrive at the overall quality of the articles and explored the differences between, and associations of, the 2 independent assessments."
9448,2,"Of the 223 articles that were retrieved, 130 (58.3%) full texts were included. "
9449,2,"Of these 130 articles, 81 (62.3%) described therapeutic measures for hypertension. "
9450,2,The assessment based on the DISCERN instrument reported a mean score of 31.22 (SD 8.46). 
9451,2,"There were no articles rated excellent (mean score >63); most (111/130, 85.4%) of the articles did not refer to the consequences-in particular, quality of life-of no treatment. "
9452,2,"For specific medical content, adherence to the Chinese Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension was generally low in terms of accuracy and completeness, and there was much erroneous information. "
9453,2,"The overall mean quality score was 10.18 (SD 2.22) for the 130 articles, and the scores differed significantly across the 3 types (P=.03) and 5 sources (P=.02). "
9454,2,Articles with references achieved higher scores for quality than those reporting none (P<.001). 
9455,2,The results from the DISCERN assessment and the medical content scores were highly correlated (rho=0.58; P<.001).
9456,3,The quality of hypertension treatment-related information on the WeChat platform is low. 
9457,3,Future work is warranted to regulate information sources and strengthen references. 
9458,3,"For the treatment of hypertension, crucial information on the consequences of no treatment is urgently needed."
9459,4,"Public Health Information Seeking, Trust, and COVID-19 Prevention Behaviors: Cross-sectional Study"
9460,0,Preventative health measures such as shelter in place and mask wearing have been widely encouraged to curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease. 
9461,0,People's attitudes toward preventative behaviors may be dependent on their sources of information and trust in the information.
9462,1,We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey of residents in St. 
9463,1,Louis City and County in Missouri. 
9464,1,Individuals aged >= 18 years were eligible to participate. 
9465,1,Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling approach through social media and email. 
9466,1,"The Health Belief Model and the Socioecological Model informed instrument development, as well as COVID-19-related questions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "
9467,1,"We performed an ordinary least squares linear regression model to estimate social distancing practices, perceptions, and trust in COVID-19 information sources."
9468,2,"Of the 1650 eligible participants, the majority (n=1381, 83.7%) had sought or received COVID-19-related information from a public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or both. "
9469,2,Regression analysis showed a 1% increase in preventative behaviors for every 12% increase in trust in governmental health agencies. 
9470,2,"At their lowest levels of trust, women were 68% more likely to engage in preventative behaviors than men. "
9471,2,"Overall, those aged 18-45 years without vulnerable medical conditions were the least likely to engage in preventative behaviors."
9472,3,Trust in COVID-19 information increases an individual's likelihood of practicing preventative behaviors. 
9473,3,Effective health communication strategies should be used to effectively disseminate health information during disease outbreaks.
9474,4,"Preliminary Investigation of Shift, a Novel Smartphone App to Support Junior Doctors Mental Health and Well-being: Examination of Symptom Progression, Usability, and Acceptability After 1 Month of Use"
9475,0,Shift is a novel smartphone app for providing a digital-first mental health resource to junior doctors. 
9476,0,"It contains psychoeducational material, cognitive behavioral modules, guided mediations, information on common work stressors, and a section on help-seeking options for psychological problems through workplace and private avenues."
9477,1,"Junior doctors in New South Wales, Australia, were approached through promotional activities from the Ministry of Health, specialist medical colleges, and social media advertisements between June and August 2020. "
9478,1,"Consenting participants provided web-based baseline data, used the Shift app for 30 days, and were asked to complete a poststudy web-based questionnaire. "
9479,1,Outcomes were analyzed under the intention-to-treat principle.
9480,2,"A total of 222 female (n=156, 70.3%; mean age 29.2, SD 4.61 years) junior doctors provided full baseline data. "
9481,2,"Of these, 89.2% (198/222) downloaded the app, logged into the app approximately 6 times (mean 5.68, SD 7.51), completed 4 in-app activities (mean 3.77, SD 4.36), and spent a total of 1 hour on in-app activities (mean 52:23, SD 6:00:18) over 30 days. "
9482,2,Postintervention and app use data were provided by 24.3% (54/222) of participants. 
9483,2,"Depressive and anxiety symptoms significantly decreased between the pre-and postassessment points as expected; however, physicians' COVID-19 safety concerns significantly increased. "
9484,2,"Work and social functioning, COVID-19 concerns for family and friends, and help seeking did not change significantly. "
9485,2,"There was no significant relationship between symptom changes and app use (number of log-ins, days between first and last log-in, and total activity time). "
9486,2,"Most poststudy completers (31/54, 57%) rated Shift highly or very highly."
9487,3,"Despite high levels of nonresponse to the poststudy assessment and increases in COVID-19 safety concerns, junior doctors who used the app reported some improvements in depression and anxiety, which warrant further exploration in a robust manner."
9488,4,Newborn Skin Maturity Medical Device Validation for Gestational Age Prediction: Clinical Trial
9489,0,Early access to antenatal care and high-cost technologies for pregnancy dating challenge early neonatal risk assessment at birth in resource-constrained settings. 
9490,0,"To overcome the absence or inaccuracy of postnatal gestational age (GA), we developed a new medical device to assess GA based on the photobiological properties of newborns' skin and predictive models."
9491,1,"A multicenter, single-blinded, and single-arm intention-to-diagnosis clinical trial evaluated the accuracy of a novel device for the detection of GA and preterm newborns. "
9492,1,"The first-trimester ultrasound, a second comparator ultrasound, and data regarding the last menstrual period (LMP) from antenatal reports were used as references for GA at birth. "
9493,1,"The new test for validation was performed using a portable multiband reflectance photometer device that assessed the skin maturity of newborns and used machine learning models to predict GA, adjusted for birth weight and antenatal corticosteroid therapy exposure."
9494,2,"The study group comprised 702 pregnant women who gave birth to 781 newborns, of which 366 (46.9%) were preterm newborns. "
9495,2,"As the primary outcome, the GA as predicted by the new test was in line with the reference GA that was calculated by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (0.969, 95% CI 0.964-0.973). "
9496,2,"The paired difference between predicted and reference GAs was -1.34 days, with Bland-Altman limits of -21.2 to 18.4 days. "
9497,2,"As a secondary outcome, the new test achieved 66.6% (95% CI 62.9%-70.1%) agreement with the reference GA within an error of 1 week. "
9498,2,"This agreement was similar to that of comparator-LMP-GAs (64.1%, 95% CI 60.7%-67.5%). "
9499,2,"The discrimination between preterm and term newborns via the device had a similar area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.970, 95% CI 0.959-0.981) compared with that for comparator-LMP-GAs (0.957, 95% CI 0.941-0.974). "
9500,2,"In newborns with absent or unreliable LMPs (n=451), the intent-to-discriminate analysis showed correct preterm versus term classifications with the new test, which achieved an accuracy of 89.6% (95% CI 86.4%-92.2%), while the accuracy for comparator-LMP-GA was 69.6% (95% CI 65.3%-73.7%)."
9501,3,"The assessment of newborn's skin maturity (adjusted by learning models) promises accurate pregnancy dating at birth, even without the antenatal ultrasound reference. "
9502,3,"Thus, the novel device could add value to the set of clinical parameters that direct the delivery of neonatal care in birth scenarios where GA is unknown or unreliable."
9503,4,Emergency Departments Uptake of Telehealth for Stroke Versus Pediatric Care: Observational Study
9504,0,"Telehealth for emergency stroke care delivery (telestroke) has had widespread adoption, enabling many hospitals to obtain stroke center certification. "
9505,0,Telehealth for pediatric emergency care has been less widely adopted.
9506,1,We used the 2016 National Emergency Department Inventory-USA to identify EDs that were using telestroke and pediatric telehealth services. 
9507,1,We surveyed all EDs using pediatric telehealth services (n=339) and a convenience sample of the 1758 EDs with telestroke services (n=366). 
9508,1,"The surveys characterized ED staffing, transfer patterns, reasons for adoption, and frequency of use. "
9509,1,"We used bivariate comparisons to examine differences in reasons for adoption and use between EDs with only telestroke services, only pediatric telehealth services, or both."
9510,2,"Of the 442 EDs surveyed, 378 (85.5%) indicated use of telestroke, pediatric telehealth, or both. "
9511,2,"EDs with both services were smaller in bed size, volume, and ED attending coverage than those with only telestroke services or only pediatric telehealth services. "
9512,2,"EDs with telestroke services reported more frequent use, overall, than EDs with pediatric telehealth services: 14.1% (45/320) of EDs with telestroke services reported weekly use versus 2.9% (8/272) of EDs with pediatric telehealth services (P<.001). "
9513,2,"In addition, 37 out of 272 (13.6%) EDs with pediatric telehealth services reported no consults in the past year. "
9514,2,"Across applications, the most frequently selected reason for adoption was ""improving level of clinical care."" Policy-related reasons (ie, for compliance with outside certification or standards or for improving ED performance on quality metrics) were rarely indicated as the most important, but these reasons were indicated slightly more often for telestroke adoption (12/320, 3.8%) than for pediatric telehealth adoption (1/272, 0.4%; P=.003)."
9515,3,"In 2016, more US EDs had telestroke services than pediatric telehealth services; among EDs with the technology, consults were more frequently made for stroke than for pediatric patients. "
9516,3,The most frequently indicated reason for adoption among all EDs was related to clinical care.
9517,4,Patients Experiences of Web-Based Access to Electronic Health Records in Finland: Cross-sectional Survey
9518,0,Patient portals that provide access to electronic health records offer a means for patients to better understand and self-manage their health. 
9519,0,"Yet, patient access to electronic health records raises many concerns among physicians, and little is known about the use practices and experiences of patients who access their electronic health records via a mature patient portal that has been available for citizens for over five years."
9520,1,Data were collected from 3135 patient users of the Finnish My Kanta patient portal through a web-based survey in June 2021 (response rate: 0.7%). 
9521,1,Patients received an invitation to complete the questionnaire when they logged out of the patient portal. 
9522,1,"Respondents were asked to rate the usability of the patient portal, and the ratings were used to calculate approximations of the System Usability Scale score. "
9523,1,"Patients were also asked about the usefulness of features, and whether they had discussed the notes with health professionals. "
9524,1,Open-ended questions were used to ask patients about their experiences of the benefits and challenges related to reading health professionals' notes.
9525,2,"Overall, patient evaluations of My Kanta were positive, and its usability was rated as good (System Usability Scale score approximation: mean 72.7, SD 15.9). "
9526,2,Patients found the portal to be the most useful for managing prescriptions and viewing the results of examinations and medical notes. 
9527,2,"Viewing notes was the most frequent reason (978/3135, 31.2%) for visiting the portal. "
9528,2,"Benefits of reading the notes mentioned by patients included remembering and understanding what was said by health professionals and the instructions given during an appointment, the convenience of receiving information about health and care, the capability to check the accuracy of notes, and using the information to support self-management. "
9529,2,"However, there were challenges related to difficulty in understanding medical terminology, incorrect or inadequate notes, missing notes, and usability."
9530,3,"Patients actively used medical notes to receive information to follow professionals' instructions to take care of their health, and patient access to electronic health records can support self-management. "
9531,3,"However, for the benefits to be realized, improvements in the quality and availability of medical professionals' notes are necessary. "
9532,3,Providing a standard information structure could help patients find the information they need. 
9533,3,"Furthermore, linking notes to vocabularies and other information sources could also improve the understandability of medical terminology; patient agency could be supported by allowing them to add comments to their notes, and patient trust of the system could be improved by allowing them to control the visibility of the professionals' notes."
9534,4,Indicated Web-Based Prevention for Women With Anorexia Nervosa Symptoms: Randomized Controlled Efficacy Trial
9535,0,"Although preventive interventions for eating disorders in general have shown promise, interventions specifically targeting individuals at risk for anorexia nervosa (AN) are lacking."
9536,1,We conducted a randomized controlled efficacy trial for women at risk for AN. 
9537,1,"Assessments were carried out at baseline (before the intervention), after the intervention (10 weeks after baseline), and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups (FU5). "
9538,1,"A total of 168 women with low body weight (17.5 kg/m(2) <= BMI <= 19 kg/m(2)) and high weight concerns or with normal body weight (19 kg/m(2)<= BMI <= 25 kg/m(2)), high weight concerns, and high restrained eating were recruited from 3 German universities as well as on the web and randomized to Student Bodies-AN (SB-AN; intervention group [IG]) or a wait-list control group (CG). "
9539,1,"The exclusion criteria were current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-based full-syndrome eating disorders and serious medical or mental problems. "
9540,1,The interventions were a cognitive-behavioral guided web-based prevention program (SB-AN) over 10 weeks (IG) and a wait-list CG. 
9541,1,The primary outcomes were clinically significant changes in disordered eating attitudes and behaviors and change in BMI at 12-month FU in the group of participants who were underweight. 
9542,1,"The secondary outcomes were new onset of eating disorders, symptoms of disordered eating, and associated psychopathology."
9543,2,Data were available for 81.5% (137/168) of the women after the intervention and for 69% (116/168) of the women at 12-month FU. 
9544,2,"At 12-month FU, the IG participants showed larger decreases in Eating Disorder Examination total scores (38/48, 79% vs 33/58, 57%) than the CG participants and the IG participants who were underweight also showed larger clinically relevant increases in BMI (15/31, 49% vs 10/32, 32%) than the CG participants, but these differences were not significant. "
9545,2,"In addition, after the intervention and at 12-month FU, we found a significant increase in continuously measured BMI for the participants who were underweight and significant improvements in disordered eating attitudes and behaviors (eg, restrained eating as well as weight and shape concerns). "
9546,2,"At all time points, the rates of new-onset eating disorder cases were (nonsignificantly) lower in the IG than in the CG and the reductions in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition-based eating disorder syndromes were (nonsignificantly) higher in the IG than in the CG."
9547,3,"SB-AN is the first preventive intervention shown to significantly reduce specific risk factors for, and symptoms of, AN and shows promise for reducing full-syndrome AN onset."
9548,4,Durability of the Treatment Effects of an 8-Week Self-administered Home-Based Virtual Reality Program for Chronic Low Back Pain: Follow-up Study of a Randomized Clinical Trial
9549,0,We previously reported the efficacy of an 8-week home-based therapeutic immersive virtual reality (VR) program in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study. 
9550,0,Community-based adults with self-reported chronic low back pain were randomized 1:1 to receive either (1) a 56-day immersive therapeutic pain relief skills VR program (EaseVRx) or (2) a 56-day sham VR program. 
9551,0,"Immediate posttreatment results revealed the superiority of therapeutic VR over sham VR for reducing pain intensity; pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress (but not sleep); physical function; and sleep disturbance. "
9552,0,"At 3 months posttreatment, therapeutic VR maintained superiority for reducing pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, and sleep (new finding)."
9553,1,"E-surveys were deployed at pretreatment, end-of-treatment, and posttreatment months 1, 2, 3, and 6. "
9554,1,Self-reported data for 188 participants were analyzed in a mixed-model framework using a marginal model to allow for correlated responses across the repeated measures. 
9555,1,"Primary outcomes were pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, stress, and sleep at 6 months posttreatment. "
9556,1,Secondary outcomes were Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep disturbance and physical function.
9557,2,"Therapeutic VR maintained significant and clinically meaningful effects 6 months posttreatment and remained superior to sham VR for reducing pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, and sleep (ds=0.44-0.54; P<.003). "
9558,2,"Between-group comparisons for physical function and sleep disturbance showed superiority of EaseVRx over sham VR (ds=0.34; P=.02 and ds=0.46; P<.001, respectively). "
9559,2,"Participants were encouraged to contact study staff with any problems experienced during treatment; however, no participants contacted study staff to report adverse events of any type, including nausea and motion sickness."
9560,3,Our 8-week home-based VR pain management program caused important reductions in pain intensity and interference up to 6 months after treatment. 
9561,3,Additional studies are needed in diverse samples.
9562,4,A Gamified Personalized Normative Feedback App to Reduce Drinking Among Sexual Minority Women: Randomized Controlled Trial and Feasibility Study
9563,0,Sexual minority women disproportionately engage in heavy drinking and shoulder the burden of alcohol dependence. 
9564,0,"Although several intensive interventions are being developed to meet the needs of treatment-seeking sexual minority women, there remains a lack of preventive interventions to reduce drinking and its consequences among women not yet motivated to reduce their alcohol consumption."
9565,1,"Feasibility was assessed by examining engagement with LezParlay outside the context of an incentivized research study, assessing the characteristics of the LBQ women taking part, and examining the competition's ability to derive risk-reducing actual norms as well as levels of acceptability and perceived benefits reported by participants. "
9566,1,"Intervention efficacy was examined by randomizing a subsample of 499 LBQ alcohol consumers (ie, drinkers) already taking part in the competition to receive sexual identity-specific PNF on alcohol use and coping, alcohol use only, or control topics over only 2 rounds of play. "
9567,1,Changes in alcohol use and negative consequences were examined 2 and 4 months after the delivery of treatment PNF.
9568,2,A total of 2667 diverse LBQ women played >= 1 round of LezParlay. 
9569,2,"The competition attracted large numbers of moderate and heavy drinkers; however, risk-reducing actual norms could still be derived from competition rounds and featured in PNF. "
9570,2,"Efficacy results revealed that drinkers who received PNF on alcohol use and both alcohol use and coping had similar reductions in their weekly drinks (P=.003; P<.001), peak drinks (P<.001; P<.001), and negative consequences (P<.001; P<.001) relative to those who received PNF on control topics at the 2-month follow-up. "
9571,2,"However, at the 4-month follow-up, reductions in alcohol consumption outcomes faded among those who received alcohol PNF only (weekly: P=.06; peak: P=.11), whereas they remained relatively robust among those who received PNF on both alcohol use and coping (weekly: P=.02; peak: P=.03). "
9572,2,"Finally, participants found the competition highly acceptable and psychologically beneficial as a whole."
9573,3,The LezParlay competition was found to be a feasible and efficacious means of reducing alcohol-related risks in this population. 
9574,3,Our findings demonstrate the utility of correcting sexual identity-specific drinking and coping norms to reduce alcohol-related risks among LBQ women and suggest that this approach may also prove fruitful in other stigmatized health disparity populations. 
9575,3,"To engage these populations in the real world and expand the psychological benefits associated with PNF, our findings also point to packaging PNF within a broader, culturally tailored competition designed to challenge negative group stereotypes."
9576,4,The Effectiveness of Mobile Phone Messaging-Based Interventions to Promote Physical Activity in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
9577,0,The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide. 
9578,0,Physical activity (PA) is an important aspect of self-care and first line management for T2DM. 
9579,0,"SMS text messaging can be used to support self-management in people with T2DM, but the effectiveness of mobile text message-based interventions in increasing PA is still unclear."
9580,1,A systematic review was conducted to accomplish this objective. 
9581,1,"Search sources included 5 bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Embase), the search engine Google Scholar (Google Inc), and backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. "
9582,1,"A total of 2 reviewers (MA and AA) independently carried out the study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and quality of evidence evaluation. "
9583,1,"The results of the included studies were synthesized narratively and statistically, as appropriate."
9584,2,We included 3.8% (6/151) of the retrieved studies. 
9585,2,The results of individual studies were contradictory regarding the effectiveness of mobile text messaging on PA. 
9586,2,"However, a meta-analysis of the results of 5 studies showed no statistically significant effect (P=.16) of text messages on PA in comparison with no intervention. "
9587,2,A meta-analysis of the findings of 2 studies showed a nonsignificant effect (P=.14) of text messages on glycemic control. 
9588,2,"Of the 541 studies, 2 (0.4%) found a nonsignificant effect of text messages on anthropometric measures (weight and BMI)."
9589,3,"We could not draw a definitive conclusion regarding the effectiveness of text messaging on PA, glycemic control, weight, or BMI among patients with T2MD, given the limited number of included studies and their high risk of bias. "
9590,3,"Therefore, there is a need for more high-quality primary studies."
9591,4,Internet-Based Audiologist-Guided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Tinnitus: Randomized Controlled Trial
9592,0,Tinnitus is a symptom that can be very distressing owing to hearing sounds not related to any external sound source. 
9593,0,"Managing tinnitus is notoriously difficult, and access to evidence-based care is limited. "
9594,0,Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a tinnitus management strategy with the most evidence of effectiveness but is rarely offered to those distressed by tinnitus. 
9595,0,"The provision of internet-based CBT for tinnitus overcomes accessibility barriers; however, it is not currently readily available in the United States."
9596,1,A 2-arm randomized clinical trial comparing audiologist-guided internet-based CBT (n=79) to a weekly monitoring group (n=79) with a 2-month follow-up assessed the efficacy of internet-based CBT. 
9597,1,Eligible participants included adults seeking help for tinnitus. 
9598,1,Recruitment was conducted on the web using an open-access website. 
9599,1,"Participants were randomized via 1:1 allocation, but blinding was not possible. "
9600,1,The study was undertaken by English or Spanish speakers on the web. 
9601,1,The primary outcome was a change in tinnitus distress as measured using the Tinnitus Functional Index. 
9602,1,"Secondary outcome measures included anxiety, depression, insomnia, tinnitus cognition, hearing-related difficulties, and quality of life."
9603,2,"Internet-based CBT led to a greater reduction in tinnitus distress (mean 36.57, SD 22) compared with that in weekly monitoring (mean 46.31, SD 20.63; effect size: Cohen d=0.46, 95% CI 0.14-0.77) using an intention-to-treat analysis. "
9604,2,"For the secondary outcomes, there was a greater reduction in negative tinnitus cognition and insomnia. "
9605,2,The results remained stable over the 2-month follow-up period. 
9606,2,No important adverse events were observed. 
9607,2,"Further, 16% (10/158) of participants withdrew, with low overall compliance rates for questionnaire completion of 72.3% (107/148) at T1, 61% (91/148) at T2, and 42% (62/148) at T3."
9608,3,This study is the first to evaluate and indicate the efficacy of audiologist-delivered internet-based CBT in reducing tinnitus distress in a US population. 
9609,3,It was also the first study to offer internet-based CBT in Spanish to accommodate the large Hispanic population in the United States. 
9610,3,"The results have been encouraging, and further work is indicated in view of making such an intervention applicable to a wider population. "
9611,3,Further work is required to improve compliance and attract more Spanish speakers.
9612,4,Perspectives of Policy Makers and Service Users Concerning the Implementation of eHealth in Sweden: Interview Study
9613,0,Increasing life spans of populations and a growing demand for more advanced care make effective and cost-efficient provision of health care necessary. 
9614,0,"eHealth technology is often proposed, although research on barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of eHealth technology is still scarce and fragmented."
9615,1,This study used interview data from policy makers at different levels of health care (n=7) and service users enrolled in eHealth interventions (n=25). 
9616,1,The analysis included separate qualitative content analyses for the 2 groups and then a second qualitative content analysis to explore differences and commonalities.
9617,2,Implementation barriers perceived by policy makers were that not all service users benefit from eHealth and that there is uncertainty about the impact of eHealth on the work of health care professionals. 
9618,2,Policy makers also perceived political decision-making as complex; this included problems related to provision of technical infrastructure and lack of extra resources for health care digitalization. 
9619,2,"Facilitators were policy makers' conviction that eHealth is what citizens want, their belief in eHealth solutions as beneficial for health care practice, and their belief in the importance of health care digitalization. "
9620,2,"Barriers for service users comprised capability limitations and varied preferences of service users and a mismatch of technology with user needs, lack of data protection, and their perception of eHealth as being more time consuming. "
9621,2,"Facilitators for service users were eHealth technology design and match with their skill set, personal feedback and staff support, a sense of privacy, a credible sender, and flexible use of time.There were several commonalities between the 2 stakeholder groups. "
9622,2,Facilitators for both groups were the strong impetus toward technology adoption in society and expectations of time flexibility. 
9623,2,"Both groups perceived barriers in the difficulties of tailoring eHealth, and both groups expressed uncertainty about the care burden distribution. "
9624,2,There were also differences: policy makers perceived that their decision-making was very complex and that resources for implementation were limited. 
9625,2,Service users highlighted their need to feel that their digital data were protected and that they needed to trust the eHealth sender.
9626,3,Perceptions about barriers to and facilitators of eHealth implementation varied among stakeholders in different parts of the health care system. 
9627,3,The study points to the need to reach an enhanced mutual understanding of priorities and overcome challenges at both the micro and macro levels of the health care system. 
9628,3,More well-balanced decisions at the policy-maker level may lead to more effective and sustainable development and future implementation of eHealth.
9629,4,Predictors of Smartphone and Tablet Use Among Patients With Hypertension: Secondary Analysis of Health Information National Trends Survey Data
9630,0,Uncontrolled hypertension leads to significant morbidity and mortality. 
9631,0,"The use of mobile health technology, such as smartphones, for remote blood pressure (BP) monitoring has improved BP control. "
9632,0,An increase in BP control is more significant when patients can remotely communicate with their health care providers through technologies and receive feedback. 
9633,0,Little is known about the predictors of remote BP monitoring among hypertensive populations.
9634,1,"This study was a cross-sectional, secondary analysis of the 2017 and 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey 5, cycles 1 and 2 data. "
9635,1,"A total of 3045 respondents answered ""Yes"" to the question ""Has a doctor or other healthcare provider ever told you that you had high blood pressure or hypertension?"", which defined the subpopulation used in this study. "
9636,1,We applied the Health Information National Trends Survey full sample weight to calculate the population estimates and 50 replicate weights to calculate the SEs of the estimates. 
9637,1,We used design-adjusted descriptive statistics to describe the characteristics of respondents who are hypertensive based on relevant survey items. 
9638,1,Design-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to estimate predictors of achieving health goals with the help of smartphone or tablet and sending or receiving an SMS text message to or from a health care provider in the last 12 months.
9639,2,"An estimated 36.9%, SE 0.9% (183,285,150/497,278,883) of the weighted adult population in the United States had hypertension. "
9640,2,The mean age of the hypertensive population was 58.3 (SE 0.48) years. 
9641,2,"Electronic communication with the doctor or doctor's office through email or internet (odds ratio 2.93, 95% CI 1.85-4.63; P<.001) and having a wellness app (odds ratio 1.82, 95% CI 1.16-2.86; P=.02) were significant predictors of using SMS text message communication with a health care professional, adjusting for other demographic and technology-related variables. "
9642,2,The odds of achieving health-related goals with the help of a tablet or smartphone declined significantly with older age (P<.001) and ownership of basic cellphones (P=.04). 
9643,2,"However, they increased significantly with being a woman (P=.045) or with being married (P=.03), having a wellness app (P<.001), using devices other than smartphones or tablets to monitor health (P=.008), making health treatment decisions (P=.048), and discussing with a provider (P=.02) with the help of a tablet or smartphone."
9644,3,"Intervention measures accounting for age, gender, marital status, and the patient's technology-related health behaviors are required to increase smartphone and tablet use in self-care and SMS text message communication with health care providers."
9645,4,Crowdsourcing for Machine Learning in Public Health Surveillance: Lessons Learned From Amazon Mechanical Turk
9646,0,"Crowdsourcing services, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), allow researchers to use the collective intelligence of a wide range of web users for labor-intensive tasks. "
9647,0,"As the manual verification of the quality of the collected results is difficult because of the large volume of data and the quick turnaround time of the process, many questions remain to be explored regarding the reliability of these resources for developing digital public health systems."
9648,1,"We collected 296,166 crowd-generated labels for 98,722 tweets, labeled by 610 AMT workers, to develop machine learning (ML) models for detecting behaviors related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep quality among Twitter users. "
9649,1,"To infer the ground truth labels and explore the quality of these labels, we studied 4 statistical consensus methods that are agnostic of task features and only focus on worker labeling behavior. "
9650,1,"Moreover, to model the meta-information associated with each labeling task and leverage the potential of context-sensitive data in the truth inference process, we developed 7 ML models, including traditional classifiers (offline and active), a deep learning-based classification model, and a hybrid convolutional neural network model."
9651,2,"Although most crowdsourcing-based studies in public health have often equated majority vote with quality, the results of our study using a truth set of 9000 manually labeled tweets showed that consensus-based inference models mask underlying uncertainty in data and overlook the importance of task meta-information. "
9652,2,"Our evaluations across 3 physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep quality data sets showed that truth inference is a context-sensitive process, and none of the methods studied in this paper were consistently superior to others in predicting the truth label. "
9653,2,"We also found that the performance of the ML models trained on crowd-labeled data was sensitive to the quality of these labels, and poor-quality labels led to incorrect assessment of these models. "
9654,2,"Finally, we have provided a set of practical recommendations to improve the quality and reliability of crowdsourced data."
9655,3,"Our findings indicate the importance of the quality of crowd-generated labels in developing ML models designed for decision-making purposes, such as public health surveillance decisions. "
9656,3,A combination of inference models outlined and analyzed in this study could be used to quantitatively measure and improve the quality of crowd-generated labels for training ML models.
9657,4,Direct Access for Patients to Diagnostic Testing and Results Using eHealth: Systematic Review on eHealth and Diagnostics
9658,0,The number of people with chronic diseases and the subsequent pressure on health care is increasing. 
9659,0,eHealth technology for diagnostic testing can contribute to more efficient health care and lower workload.
9660,1,"We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, Emcare, and Academic Search Premier databases in August 2019 and updated in July 2021. "
9661,1,"The included studies focused on direct patient access to web-based triage leading to diagnostic testing, self-sampling or testing, or web-based communication of test results. "
9662,1,A total of 45 studies were included. 
9663,1,The quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.
9664,2,Most studies had a quantitative descriptive design and discussed a combination of services. 
9665,2,Diagnostic test services mainly focused on sexually transmitted infections. 
9666,2,"Overall, the use was high for web-based triage (3046/5000, >50%, who used a triage booked a test), for self-sampling or self-testing kits (83%), and the result service (85%). "
9667,2,"The acceptability of the test services was high, with 81% preferring home-based testing over clinic-based testing. "
9668,2,There was a high rate of follow-up testing or treatment after a positive test (93%).
9669,3,"The results show that direct access to testing and result services had high use rates, was positively evaluated, and led to high rates of follow-up treatment. "
9670,3,More research on cost-effectiveness is needed to determine the potential for other diseases. 
9671,3,"Direct access to diagnostic testing can lower the threshold for testing in users, potentially increase efficiency, and lower the workload in primary care."
9672,4,Characterizing Patient-Clinician Communication in Secure Medical Messages: Retrospective Study
9673,0,Patient-clinician secure messaging is an important function in patient portals and enables patients and clinicians to communicate on a wide spectrum of issues in a timely manner. 
9674,0,"With its growing adoption and patient engagement, it is time to comprehensively study the secure messages and user behaviors in order to improve patient-centered care."
9675,1,"We performed message-based, sender-based, and thread-based analyses of more than 5 million secure messages between 2010 and 2017. "
9676,1,"We summarized the message volumes, patient and clinician population sizes, message counts per patient or clinician, as well as the trends of message volumes and user counts over the years. "
9677,1,"In addition, we calculated the time distribution of clinician-sent messages to understand their workloads at different times of a day. "
9678,1,We also analyzed the time delay in clinician responses to patient messages to assess their communication efficiency and the back-and-forth rounds to estimate the communication complexity.
9679,2,"During 2010-2017, the patient portal at Mayo Clinic, Rochester experienced a significant growth in terms of the count of patient users and the total number of secure messages sent by patients and clinicians. "
9680,2,"Three clinician categories, namely ""physician-primary care,"" ""registered nurse-specialty,"" and ""physician-specialty,"" bore the majority of message volume increase. "
9681,2,The patient portal also demonstrated growing trends in message counts per patient and clinician. 
9682,2,"The ""nurse practitioner or physician assistant-primary care"" and ""physician-primary care"" categories had the heaviest per-clinician workload each year. "
9683,2,Most messages by the clinicians were sent from 7 AM to 5 PM during a day. 
9684,2,"Yet, between 5 PM and 7 PM, the physicians sent 7.0% (95,785/1,377,006) of their daily messages, and the nurse practitioner or physician assistant sent 5.4% (22,121/408,526) of their daily messages. "
9685,2,"The clinicians replied to 72.2% (1,272,069/1,761,739) patient messages within 1 day and 90.6% (1,595,702/1,761,739) within 3 days. "
9686,2,"In 95.1% (1,499,316/1,576,205) of the message threads, the patients communicated with their clinicians back and forth for no more than 4 rounds."
9687,3,Our study found steady increases in patient adoption of the secure messaging system and the average workload per clinician over 8 years. 
9688,3,"However, most clinicians responded timely to meet the patients' needs. "
9689,3,Our study also revealed differential patient-clinician communication patterns across different practice roles and care settings. 
9690,3,These findings suggest opportunities for care teams to optimize messaging tasks and to balance the workload for optimal efficiency.
9691,4,Effectiveness and Moderators of an Internet-Based Mobile-Supported Stress Management Intervention as a Universal Prevention Approach: Randomized Controlled Trial
9692,0,Emerging evidence indicates the effectiveness of internet-based mobile-supported stress management interventions (iSMIs) in highly stressed employees. 
9693,0,"It is yet unclear, however, whether iSMIs are also effective without a preselection process in a universal prevention approach, which more closely resembles routine occupational health care. "
9694,0,"Moreover, evidence for whom iSMIs might be suitable and for whom not is scarce."
9695,1,A total of 396 employees were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the 6-month waiting list control group. 
9696,1,The iSMI consisted of 7 sessions and 1 booster session and offered no therapeutic guidance. 
9697,1,"Self-report data were assessed at baseline, 7 weeks, and at 6 months following randomization. "
9698,1,The primary outcome was perceived stress. 
9699,1,Several a priori defined moderators were explored as potential effect modifiers.
9700,2,"Participants in the intervention group reported significantly lower perceived stress at posttreatment (d=0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.91) and at 6-month follow-up (d=0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.81) compared to those in the waiting list control group. "
9701,2,Significant differences with medium-to-large effect sizes were found for all mental health and most work-related outcomes. 
9702,2,"Resilience (at 7 weeks, P=.04; at 6 months, P=.01), agreeableness (at 7 weeks, P=.01), psychological strain (at 6 months, P=.04), and self-regulation (at 6 months, P=.04) moderated the intervention effects."
9703,3,This study indicates that iSMIs can be effective in a broad range of employees with no need for preselection to achieve substantial effects. 
9704,3,"The subgroups that might not profit had extreme values on the respective measures and represented only a very small proportion of the investigated sample, thereby indicating the broad applicability of GET.ON Stress."
9705,4,Digital Interventions to Improve Health Literacy Among Parents of Children Aged 0 to 12 Years With a Health Condition: Systematic Review
9706,0,Parental health literacy is associated with child health outcomes. 
9707,0,Parents are increasingly turning to the internet to obtain health information. 
9708,0,"In response, health care providers are using digital interventions to communicate information to assist parents in managing their child's health conditions. "
9709,0,"Despite the emergence of interventions to improve parental health literacy, to date, no systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of the interventions has been undertaken."
9710,1,This systematic review was registered a priori on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) and developed according to the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews. 
9711,1,"The databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched for relevant literature published between January 2010 and April 2021. "
9712,1,Studies were included if they were written in English. 
9713,1,A total of 2 authors independently assessed the search results and performed a critical appraisal of the studies.
9714,2,"Following the review of 1351 abstracts, 31 (2.29%) studies were selected for full-text review. "
9715,2,"Of the 31 studies, 6 (19%) studies met the inclusion criteria. "
9716,2,"Of the 6 studies, 1 (17%) was excluded following the critical appraisal, and the 5 (83%) remaining studies were quantitative in design and included digital health interventions using web-based portals to improve parents' health knowledge and health behavior. "
9717,2,"Owing to heterogeneity in the reported outcomes, meta-analysis was not possible, and the findings were presented in narrative form. "
9718,2,"Of the 5 studies, satisfaction was measured in 3 (60%) studies, and all the studies reported high satisfaction with the digital intervention. "
9719,2,All the studies reported improvement in parental health literacy at postintervention as either increase in disease-specific knowledge or changes in health behavior. 
9720,2,"Of the 5 studies, only 1 (20%) study included child health outcomes, and this study reported significant improvements related to increased parental health knowledge."
9721,3,"In response to a pandemic such as COVID-19, there is an increased need for evidence-based digital health interventions for families of children living with health conditions. "
9722,3,This review has shown the potential of digital health interventions to improve health knowledge and behavior among parents of young children with a health condition. 
9723,3,"However, few digital health interventions have been developed and evaluated for this population. "
9724,3,Future studies with robust research designs are needed and should include the potential benefits of increased parent health literacy for the child.
9725,4,Prescribing Smartphone Apps for Physical Activity Promotion in Primary Care: Modeling Study of Health Gain and Cost Savings
9726,0,"Inadequate physical activity is a substantial cause of health loss worldwide, and this loss is attributable to diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and certain forms of cancer."
9727,1,A proportional multistate lifetable model was used to estimate the change in physical activity levels and predict the resultant health gains in QALYs and health system costs over the remaining life span of the NZ population alive in 2011 at a 3% discount rate.
9728,2,"The modeled intervention resulted in an estimated 430 QALYs gained (95% uncertainty interval 320-550), with net cost savings of 2011 NZ $2.2 million (2011 US $1.5 million) over the remaining life span of the 2011 NZ population. "
9729,2,"On a per capita basis, QALY gains were generally larger in women than in men and larger in Maori than in non-Maori. "
9730,2,The health impact and cost-effectiveness of the intervention were highly sensitive to assumptions on intervention uptake and decay. 
9731,2,"For example, the scenario analysis with the largest benefits, which assumed a 5-year maintenance of additional physical activity levels, delivered 1750 QALYs and 2011 NZ $22.5 million (2011 US $15.1 million) in cost savings."
9732,3,The prescription of smartphone apps for promoting physical activity in primary care settings is likely to generate modest health gains and cost savings at the population level in this high-income country. 
9733,3,Such gains may increase with ongoing improvements in app design and increased health worker promotion of the apps to patients.
9734,4,Infodemiological Examination of Personal and Commercial Tweets About Cannabidiol: Term and Sentiment Analysis
9735,0,"In the absence of official clinical trial information, data from social networks can be used by public health and medical researchers to assess public claims about loosely regulated substances such as cannabidiol (CBD). "
9736,0,"For example, this can be achieved by comparing the medical conditions targeted by those selling CBD against the medical conditions patients commonly treat with CBD."
9737,1,"We collected 567,850 tweets by searching Twitter with the Tweepy Python package using the terms ""CBD"" and ""cannabidiol."" We trained two binary text classifiers to create two corpora of 167,755 personal use and 143,322 commercial/sales tweets. "
9738,1,"Using medical, standard, and slang dictionaries, we identified and compared the most frequently occurring medical conditions, symptoms, side effects, body parts, and other substances referenced in both corpora. "
9739,1,"In addition, to assess popular claims about the efficacy of CBD as a medical treatment circulating on Twitter, we performed sentiment analysis via the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) model on the personal CBD tweets."
9740,2,"We found references to medically relevant terms that were unique to either personal or commercial CBD tweet classes, as well as medically relevant terms that were common to both classes. "
9741,2,"When we calculated the average sentiment scores for both personal and commercial CBD tweets referencing at least one of 17 medical conditions/symptoms terms, an overall positive sentiment was observed in both personal and commercial CBD tweets. "
9742,2,"We observed instances of negative sentiment conveyed in personal CBD tweets referencing autism, whereas CBD was also marketed multiple times as a treatment for autism within commercial tweets."
9743,3,Our proposed framework provides a tool for public health and medical researchers to analyze the consumption and marketing of unregulated substances on social networks. 
9744,3,"Our analysis showed that most users of CBD are satisfied with it in regard to the condition that it is being advertised for, with the exception of autism."
9745,4,Mapping Information Needs of Patients With Sexually Transmitted Infections Using Web-Based Data Sources: Grounded Theory Investigation
9746,0,"According to the World health organization (WHO), more than 1 million sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are acquired each day across the world. "
9747,0,The incidence rates of STIs in the United States are at a record high for the fourth consecutive year. 
9748,0,"Owing to the stigma associated with the incidence of STI, there is a general reluctance to seek information in person. "
9749,0,"Instead, web-based information sources remain the primary avenues of information-seeking. "
9750,0,"However, these sources are designed without a comprehensive understanding of the information needs of individuals who have contracted STIs."
9751,1,"This is a qualitative and analytical study of 549 transcripts (consisting of queries posted over the last 10 years) from web-based forums of the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA), which allows patients, volunteers, and health care providers connect anonymously. "
9752,1,The analysis follows a grounded theory (GT) approach with multiple coding stages to uncover categories and themes.
9753,2,Three categories of information needs emerged. 
9754,2,"The first two, clinical and logistical, are similar to other contexts. "
9755,2,"However, our analysis shows that there is a significant need for the last category-psychosocial information. "
9756,2,"Approximately 59% of instances are linked to concerns such as confusion, discretion, remorse, and others. "
9757,2,These needs vary across the stages of a patient's journey from symptom manifestation to treatment maintenance.
9758,3,Responding to the needs of individuals who have or suspect they have contracted an STI requires compassionate and personalized responses (beyond factual clinical and logistical information). 
9759,3,"Web-based forums provide anonymity but do not adequately incorporate mechanisms, practices, or incentives to respond to diverse psychosocial concerns. "
9760,3,Innovative approaches to add such support can make the digital interventions more effective for this group of individuals.
9761,4,"Sources of Health Information, Technology Access, and Use Among Non-English-Speaking Immigrant Women: Descriptive Correlational Study"
9762,0,"As the world is becoming increasingly connected by the World Wide Web, the internet is becoming the main source of health information. "
9763,0,"With the novel COVID-19 pandemic, ubiquitous use of the internet has changed the daily lives of individuals, from working from home to seeking and meeting with health care providers through web-based sites. "
9764,0,Such heavy reliance on internet-based technologies raises concerns regarding the accessibility of the internet for minority populations who are likely to already face barriers when seeking health information.
9765,1,We used data from a subsample of Korean American women (N=157) who participated in a community-based randomized trial designed to test a health literacy-focused cancer screening intervention. 
9766,1,"In addition to descriptive statistics to summarize Korean American women's internet access and common modes of technology use, we conducted backward stepwise logistic regression analyses to substantiate the association between the psychosocial determinants of health and internet use."
9767,2,"Approximately two-thirds (103/157, 65.6%) of the sample had access to the internet, and nearly all had access to a mobile phone. "
9768,2,"The internet was the most commonly used channel to obtain health information 63% (99/157), and 70% (110/157) of the sample used text messaging. "
9769,2,"Nevertheless, only approximately 38.8% (40/103) of the sample were very confident in using the internet, and only 29.9% (47/157) were very confident in using text messaging. "
9770,2,"Multivariate analyses revealed that older age (>50 years) was associated with 79% lower odds of using the internet to seek health information (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.21, 95% CI 0.10-0.46). "
9771,2,"The higher health literacy group (19+ on Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine) had 56% lower odds of using the internet to acquire health information (AOR 0.44, 95% CI 1.13-11.18). "
9772,2,"Higher education (college+) was associated with both internet use (AOR 4.42, 95% CI 1.88-9.21) and text messaging (AOR 3.42, 95% CI 1.55-7.54). "
9773,2,"Finally, English proficiency was associated with text messaging (AOR 4.20, 95% CI 1.44-12.24)."
9774,3,"The differences in modes of technology access, use, and confidence by some of the key psychosocial determinants, as observed in our study sample, have important implications when health care teams develop dissemination plans."
