0,4,Exploring the Use of Evidence From the Development and Evaluation of an Electronic Health (eHealth) Trial: Case Study
1,0,"Evidence-based practice refers to building clinical decisions on credible research evidence, professional experience, and patient preferences. "
2,0,"However, there is a growing concern that evidence in the context of electronic health (eHealth) is not sufficiently used when forming policies and practice of health care. "
3,0,"In this context, using evaluation and research evidence in clinical or policy decisions dominates the discourse. "
4,0,"However, the use of additional types of evidence, such as professional experience, is underexplored. "
5,0,"Moreover, there might be other ways of using evidence than in clinical or policy decisions."
6,1,This study was built on a case of an eHealth trial funded by the European Union. 
7,1,"The project included 4 care centers, 2 research and development companies that provided the web-based physical exercise program and an activity monitoring device, and 2 science institutions. "
8,1,The qualitative data collection included 9 semistructured interviews conducted 8 months after the evaluation was concluded. 
9,1,"The data analysis concerned (1) activities and decisions that were made based on evidence after the project ended, (2) evidence used for those activities and decisions, (3) in what way the evidence was used, and (4) barriers to the use of evidence."
10,2,"Evidence generated from eHealth trials can be used by various stakeholders for decisions regarding clinical integration of eHealth solutions, policy making, scientific publishing, research funding applications, eHealth technology, and teaching. "
11,2,Evaluation evidence has less value than professional experiences to local decision making regarding eHealth integration into clinical practice. 
12,2,Professional experiences constitute the evidence that is valuable to the highest variety of activities and decisions in relation to eHealth trials. 
13,2,"When using existing scientific evidence related to eHealth trials, it is important to consider contextual relevance, such as location or disease. "
14,2,"To support the use of evidence, it is suggested to create possibilities for health care professionals to gain experience, assess a few rather than a large number of variables, and design for shorter iterative cycles of evaluation."
15,3,Initiatives to support and standardize evidence-based practice in the context of eHealth should consider the complexities in how the evidence is used in order to achieve better uptake of evidence in practice. 
16,3,"However, one should be aware that the assumption of fact-based decision making in organizations is misleading. "
17,3,"In order to create better chances that the evidence produced would be used, this should be addressed through the design of eHealth trials."
18,4,"Use of the HoloLens2 Mixed Reality Headset for Protecting Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Prospective, Observational Evaluation"
19,0,"The coronavims disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to rapid acceleration in the deployment of new digital technologies to improve both accessibility to and quality of care, and to protect staff. "
20,0,Mixed-reality (MR) technology is the latest iteration of telemedicine innovation; it is a logical next step in the move toward the provision of digitally supported clinical care and medical education. 
21,0,This technology has the potential to revolutionize care both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
22,1,"A prospective, observational, nested cohort evaluation of the HoloLens2 was undertaken across three distinct clinical clusters in a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. "
23,1,"Data pertaining to staff exposure to high-risk COVID-19 environments and personal protective equipment (PPE) use by clinical staff (N=28) were collected, and assessments of acceptability and feasibility were conducted."
24,2,"The deployment of the HoloLens2 led to a 51.5% reduction in time exposed to harm for staff looking after COVID-19 patients (3.32 vs 1.63 hours/day/staff member; P=.002), and an 83.1% reduction in the amount of PPE used (178 vs 30 items/round/day; P=.02). "
25,2,"This represents 222.98 hours of reduced staff exposure to COVID-19, and 3100 fewer PPE items used each week across the three clusters evaluated. "
26,2,"The majority of staff using the device agreed it was easy to set up and comfortable to wear, improved the quality of care and decision making, and led to better teamwork and communication. "
27,2,"In total, 89.3% (25/28) of users felt that their clinical team was safer when using the HoloLens2."
28,3,"New technologies have a role in minimizing exposure to nosocomial infection, optimizing the use of PPE, and enhancing aspects of care. "
29,3,"Deploying such technologies at pace requires context-specific information security, infection control, user experience, and workflow integration to be addressed at the outset and led by clinical end-users. "
30,3,The deployment of new telemedicine technology must be supported with objective evidence for its safety and effectiveness to ensure maximum impact.
31,4,Hazards of the Cytokine Storm and Cytokine-Targeted Therapy in Patients With COVID-19: Review
32,0,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has challenged medicine and health care on a global scale. 
33,0,Its impact and frightening mortality rate are in large part attributable to the fact that there is a lack of available treatments. 
34,0,"It has been shown that in patients who are severely ill, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an inflammatory response known as cytokine storm, which involves activation and release of inflammatory cytokines in a positive feedback loop of pathogen-triggered inflammation. "
35,0,"Currently, cytokine storm is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2, but there is no proven treatment to combat this systemic response."
36,1,"A literature review was performed from December 1, 2000, to April 4, 2020, to explore and compare therapies that target cytokine storm among SARS-CoV-2 and prior coronavirus cases."
37,2,"A total of 38 eligible studies including 24 systematic reviews, 5 meta-analyses, 5 experimental model studies, 7 cohort studies, and 4 case reports matched the criteria."
38,3,"The severity of the cytokine storm, measured by elevated levels of interleukin-1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, was associated with COVID-19 disease severity. "
39,3,"Many treatment options with different targets have been proposed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from targeting the virus itself to managing the systemic inflammation caused by the virus and the excessive cytokine response. "
40,3,"Among the different agents to manage cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19, there is developing support for convalescent plasma therapy particularly for patients who are critically ill or mechanically ventilated and resistant to antivirals and supportive care. "
41,3,"Treatment options that were proposed in the beginning phases of the pandemic were multidimensional, and further research is needed to develop a more established treatment guideline."
42,4,Machine Learning Classifiers for Twitter Surveillance of Vaping: Comparative Machine Learning Study
43,0,Twitter presents a valuable and relevant social media platform to study the prevalence of information and sentiment on vaping that may be useful for public health surveillance. 
44,0,Machine learning classifiers that identify vaping-relevant tweets and characterize sentiments in them can underpin a Twitter-based vaping surveillance system. 
45,0,"Compared with traditional machine learning classifiers that are reliant on annotations that are expensive to obtain, deep learning classifiers offer the advantage of requiring fewer annotated tweets by leveraging the large numbers of readily available unannotated tweets."
46,1,We continuously collected tweets that matched vaping-related keywords over 2 months from August 2018 to October 2018. 
47,1,"From this data set of tweets, a set of 4000 tweets was selected, and each tweet was manually annotated for relevance (vape relevant or not), commercial nature (commercial or not), and sentiment (provape or not). "
48,1,"Using the annotated data, we derived traditional classifiers that included logistic regression, random forest, linear support vector machine, and multinomial naive Bayes. "
49,1,"In addition, using the annotated data set and a larger unannotated data set of tweets, we derived deep learning classifiers that included a convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, LSTM-CNN network, and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network. "
50,1,The unannotated tweet data were used to derive word vectors that deep learning classifiers can leverage to improve performance.
51,2,"LSTM-CNN performed the best with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.98) for relevance, all deep learning classifiers including LSTM-CNN performed better than the traditional classifiers with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-0.99) for distinguishing commercial from noncommercial tweets, and BiLSTM performed the best with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.78-0.89) for provape sentiment. "
52,2,"Overall, LSTM-CNN performed the best across all 3 classification tasks."
53,3,"We derived and evaluated traditional machine learning and deep learning classifiers to identify vaping-related relevant, commercial, and provape tweets. "
54,3,"Overall, deep learning classifiers such as LSTM-CNN had superior performance and had the added advantage of requiring no preprocessing. "
55,3,The performance of these classifiers supports the development of a vaping surveillance system.
56,4,"Communicating Uncertainty in Written Consumer Health Information to the Public: Parallel-Group, Web-Based Randomized Controlled Trial"
57,0,Uncertainty is integral to evidence-informed decision making and is of particular importance for preference-sensitive decisions. 
58,0,Communicating uncertainty to patients and the public has long been identified as a goal in the informed and shared decision-making movement. 
59,0,"Despite this, there is little quantitative research on how uncertainty in health information is perceived by readers."
60,1,"We developed 8 versions of a research summary on a fictitious drug for tinnitus with varying degrees (Q1), sources (Q2), and magnitudes of uncertainty (Q3). "
61,1,We recruited 2099 members of the German public from a web-based research panel. 
62,1,"Of these, 1727 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were randomly presented with one of these research summaries Randomization was conducted by using a centralized computer with a random number generator. "
63,1,Web based recruitment and data collection were fully automated. 
64,1,Participants were not aware of the purpose of the study and alternative presentations. 
65,1,"We measured the following outcomes: perception of the treatment effectiveness (primary), certainty in the judgement of treatment effectiveness, perception of the body of evidence, text quality, and intended decision. "
66,1,The outcomes were self-assessed.
67,2,"For the primary outcome, we did not find a global effect for Q1 and Q2 (P=.25 and P=.73), but we found a global effect for Q3 (P=.048). "
68,2,Pairwise comparisons showed a weaker perception of treatment effectiveness for the research summary with 3 sources of uncertainty compared to the version with 2 sources of uncertainty (P=.04). 
69,2,"Specifically, the proportion of the participants in the group with 3 sources of uncertainty that perceived the drug as possibly beneficial was 9% lower than that of the participants in the group with 2 sources of uncertainty (92/195, 47.2% vs 111/197, 56.3%, respectively). "
70,2,"The proportion of the participants in the group with 3 sources of uncertainty that considered the drug to be of unclear benefit was 8% higher than that of the participants in the group with 2 sources of uncertainty (72/195, 36.9% vs 57/197, 28.9%, respectively). "
71,2,"However, there was no significant difference compared to the version with 1 source of uncertainty (P=.31). "
72,2,We did not find any meaningful differences between the research summaries for the secondary outcomes.
73,3,Communicating even a large magnitude of uncertainty for a treatment effect had little impact on the perceived effectiveness. 
74,3,Efforts to improve public understanding of research are needed to improve the understanding of evidence-based health information.
75,4,Wildfire-Like Effect of a WhatsApp Campaign to Mobilize a Group of Predominantly Health Professionals With a University Degree on a Health Issue: Infodemiology Study
76,0,Online interactions within a closed WhatsApp group can influence the attitudes and behaviors of the users in relation to health issues.
77,1,We retrospectively analyzed data from the WhatsApp group of 205 members that was active during 4 consecutive days in August 2019. 
78,1,"The messages exchanged were collected, anonymized, and analyzed according to their timing and content."
79,2,"The WhatsApp group members were invited to the group from the administrator's contacts; 91% (187/205) had a university degree, 68% (140/205) were medical professionals, and 24% (50/205) held academic positions. "
80,2,"Approximately a quarter of the members (47/205, 23%) declared in their messages they signed the corresponding petition. "
81,2,"The intense message exchange had wildfire-like features, and the majority of messages (126/133, 95%) were exchanged during the first 26 hours. "
82,2,"Despite the viral activity and high rate of members openly declaring that they signed the petition, only 8 (8/133, 6%) messages from the group members, excluding the administrator, referred to the health issue, which was the topic of the group. "
83,2,"No member expressed an opposite opinion to those presented by the administrator, and there was no debate in the form of exchanging opposite opinions."
84,3,"The wildfire-like activity of the WhatsApp group and open declaration of signing the petition as a result of the mobilization campaign were not accompanied by any form of a debate related to the corresponding health issue, although the group members were predominantly health professionals, with a quarter of holding academic positions."
85,4,"Experiences of a National Web-Based Heart Age Calculator for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: User Characteristics, Heart Age Results, and Behavior Change Survey"
86,0,Heart age calculators are used worldwide to engage the public in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. 
87,0,"Experimental studies with small samples have found mixed effects of these tools, and previous reports of population samples that used web-based heart age tools have not evaluated psychological and behavioral outcomes."
88,1,The heart age calculator was launched in 2019 by the National Heart Foundation of Australia. 
89,1,"Heart age results were calculated for all users and recorded for those who signed up for a heart age report and an email follow-up over 10 weeks, after which a survey was conducted. "
90,1,"CVD risk factors, heart age results, and psychological and behavioral questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. "
91,1,Open responses were thematically coded.
92,2,"There were 361,044 anonymous users over 5 months, of which 30,279 signed up to receive a heart age report and 1303 completed the survey. "
93,2,"There were more women (19,840/30,279, 65.52%), with an average age of 55.67 (SD 11.43) years, and most users knew blood pressure levels (20,279/30,279, 66.97%) but not cholesterol levels (12,267/30,279, 40.51%). "
94,2,"The average heart age result was 4.61 (SD 4.71) years older than the current age, including (23,840/30,279, 78.73%) with an older heart age. "
95,2,"For the survey, most users recalled their heart age category (892/1303, 68.46%), and many reported lifestyle improvements (diet 821/1303, 63.01% and physical activity 809/1303, 62.09%). "
96,2,"People with an older heart age result were more likely to report a doctor visit (538/1055, 51.00%). "
97,2,"Participants indicated strong emotional responses to heart age, both positive and negative."
98,3,Most Australian users received an older heart age as per international and UK heart age tools. 
99,3,"Heart age reports with follow-up over 10 weeks prompted strong emotional responses, high recall rates, and self-reported lifestyle changes and clinical checks for more than half of the survey respondents. "
100,3,"These findings are based on a more engaged user sample than previous research, who were more likely to know blood pressure and cholesterol values. "
101,3,Further research is needed to determine which aspects are most effective in initiating and maintaining lifestyle changes. 
102,3,"The results confirm high public interest in heart age tools, but additional support is needed to help users understand the results and take appropriate action."
103,4,"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Partner Relationships and Sexual and Reproductive Health: Cross-Sectional, Online Survey Study"
104,0,"In the past few months, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused extensive economic and social damage."
105,1,"From May 1 to 5, 2020, 3500 young Chinese individuals were recruited through WeChat or Weibo to participate in a survey to obtain information on sexual and reproductive health (eg, sexual desire, frequency of sexual intercourse, sexual satisfaction, etc). "
106,1,"The questionnaire also collected demographic data (eg, age, race, education, current financial status, sexual orientation, relationship status, etc)."
107,2,"In total, 967 participants were included in the sexual health analysis. "
108,2,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures, 22% of participants (n=212) reported a decrease in sexual desire; 41% (n=396) experienced a decrease in the sexual intercourse frequency; 30% (n=291) reported an increase in the frequency of masturbation; 20% (n=192) reported a decrease in alcohol consumption before or during sexual activities, and 31% (n=298) reported a deterioration in partner relationships during the pandemic. "
109,2,The logistic regression analysis indicated that the following influenced partner relationships: accommodations during the pandemic (P=.046; odds ratio [OR] 0.59; 95% CI 0.30-0.86); exclusive relationship status (yes or no) (P<.001; OR 0.44; 95 % CI 0.27-0.73); sexual desire (P=.02; OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.38-2.97); and sexual satisfaction (P<.001; OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.54-2.50). 
110,2,"COVID-19 also caused disruptions in reproductive health services such as prenatal and postnatal care, childbirth and abortion services, contraception availability, and the management of sexually transmitted infections."
111,3,Our results show that many young people have wide-ranging issues affecting their sexual and reproductive health due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures. 
112,3,Strategies and guidelines are needed to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health of young people during this pandemic.
113,4,Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: Bibliometric Analysis
114,0,"As a critical driving power to promote health care, the health care-related artificial intelligence (AI) literature is growing rapidly."
115,1,The Web of Science (Clarivate PLC) was searched to retrieve all existing and highly cited AI-related health care research papers published in English up to December 2019. 
116,1,"Based on bibliometric indicators, a search strategy was developed to screen the title for eligibility, using the abstract and full text where needed. "
117,1,"The growth rate of publications, characteristics of research activities, publication patterns, and research hotspot tendencies were computed using the HistCite software."
118,2,"The search identified 5235 hits, of which 1473 publications were included in the analyses. "
119,2,"Publication output increased an average of 17.02% per year since 1995, but the growth rate of research papers significantly increased to 45.15% from 2014 to 2019. "
120,2,"The major health problems studied in AI research are cancer, depression, Alzheimer disease, heart failure, and diabetes. "
121,2,"Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks have the highest impact on health care. "
122,2,"Nucleosides, convolutional neural networks, and tumor markers have remained research hotspots through 2019."
123,3,"This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-related research conducted in the field of health care, which helps researchers, policy makers, and practitioners better understand the development of health care-related AI research and possible practice implications. "
124,3,Future AI research should be dedicated to filling in the gaps between AI health care research and clinical applications.
125,4,Biased Sampling and Causal Estimation of Health-Related Information: Laboratory-Based Experimental Research
126,0,The internet is a relevant source of health-related information. 
127,0,The huge amount of information available on the internet forces users to engage in an active process of information selection. 
128,0,"Previous research conducted in the field of experimental psychology showed that information selection itself may promote the development of erroneous beliefs, even if the information collected does not."
129,1,We adapted a standard laboratory task that has previously been used in research on contingency learning to mimic an information searching situation. 
130,1,Participants (N=193) were asked to gather information to determine whether a fictitious drug caused an allergic reaction. 
131,1,They collected individual pieces of evidence in order to support or reject the causal relationship between the two events by inspecting individual cases in which the drug was or was not used or in which the allergic reaction appeared or not. 
132,1,"Thus, one group (cause group, n=105) was allowed to sample information based on the potential cause, whereas a second group (effect group, n=88) was allowed to sample information based on the effect. "
133,1,Although participants could select which medical records they wanted to check-cases in which the medicine was used or not (in the cause group) or cases in which the effect appeared or not (in the effect group)-they all received similar evidence that indicated the absence of a causal link between the drug and the reaction. 
134,1,"After observing 40 cases, they estimated the drug-allergic reaction causal relationship."
135,2,Participants used different strategies for collecting information. 
136,2,"In some cases, participants displayed a biased sampling strategy compatible with positive testing, that is, they required a high proportion of evidence in which the drug was administered (in the cause group) or in which the allergic reaction appeared (in the effect group). "
137,2,"Biased strategies produced an overrepresentation of certain pieces of evidence at the detriment of the representation of others, which was associated with the accuracy of causal inferences. "
138,2,"Thus, how the information was collected (sampling strategy) demonstrated a significant effect on causal inferences (F-1,F-185 =32.53, P<.001, eta(2P)=0.15) suggesting that inferences of the causal relationship between events are related to how the information is gathered."
139,3,Mistaken beliefs about health may arise from accurate pieces of information partially because of the way in which information is collected. 
140,3,"Patient or person autonomy in gathering health information through the internet, for instance, may contribute to the development of false beliefs from accurate pieces of information because search strategies can be biased."
141,4,The Promise of Patient Portals for Individuals Living With Chronic Illness: Qualitative Study Identifying Pathways of Patient Engagement
142,0,"Patients play a critical role in managing their health, especially in the context of chronic conditions like diabetes. "
143,0,"Electronic patient portals have been identified as a potential means to improve patient engagement; that is, patients' involvement in their care. "
144,0,"However, little is known about the pathways through which portals may help patients engage in their care."
145,1,"This qualitative study employed semistructured telephone interviews of 40 patients living with diabetes since at least 2011, who had experienced uncontrolled diabetes, and had used secure messaging through a portal at least 4 times over 18 months. "
146,1,"The interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed using primarily an inductive approach to identify how patients living with diabetes use an online health portal to support diabetes self-management."
147,2,"Overall, patients who used the portal reported feeling engaged in their health care. "
148,2,We identified four pathways by which the portal facilitates patient engagement and some challenges. 
149,2,"The portal provides a platform that patients use to (1) better understand their health by asking questions about new symptoms, notes, or labs, (2) prepare for medical appointments by reviewing labs and notes, (3) coordinate care between VA (Veterans Affairs) and non-VA health care teams, and (4) reach out to providers to request help between visits. "
150,2,"Several patients reported that the portal helped improve the patient-provider relationship; however, aspects of the portal design may hinder engagement for others. "
151,2,Patients reported challenges with both secure messaging and access to medical records that had negative impacts on their engagement. 
152,2,Benefits for patient engagement were described by many types of portal users with varying degrees of diabetes control.
153,3,Patient portals support engagement by facilitating patient access to their health information and by facilitating patient-provider communication. 
154,3,Portals can help a wide range of users engage with their care.
155,4,Technology-Based Interventions in Oral Anticoagulation Management: Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
156,0,An increasing number of patients have received prophylactic or therapeutic oral anticoagulants (OACs) for thromboembolic complications of diseases. 
157,0,The use of OACs is associated with both clinical benefits and risks. 
158,0,"Considering the challenges imposed by this class of drugs, as well as the enormous progress made in portable device technology, it is possible that technology-based interventions may improve clinical benefits for patients and optimize anticoagulation management."
159,1,"We searched 6 databases-PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, and PsycINFO-to retrieve relevant studies published as of November 1, 2019, to evaluate the effect of technology-based interventions on oral anticoagulation management. "
160,1,RevMan (version 5.3; Cochrane) software was used to evaluate and analyze clinical outcomes. 
161,1,The methodological quality of studies was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool.
162,2,A total of 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected for analysis. 
163,2,They reported data for 2218 patients (1110 patients in the intervention groups and 1108 patients in the control groups). 
164,2,A meta-analysis was performed on the effectiveness and safety data reported in the RCTs. 
165,2,Technology-based interventions significantly improved the effectiveness of oral anticoagulation management (mean difference [MD]=6.07; 95% CI 0.84-11.30; I-2=72%; P=.02). 
166,2,"The safety of oral anticoagulation management was also improved, but the results were not statistically significant. "
167,2,"Bleeding events were reduced (major bleeding events MD=1.02; 95% CI 0.78-1.32; I-2=0%; P=.90; minor bleeding events MD=1.06, 95% CI 0.77-1.44; I-2=41%; P=.73) and thromboembolism events were reduced (MD=0.71; 95% CI 0.49-1.01; I-2=0%; P=.06). "
168,2,"In general, patients were more satisfied with technology-based interventions, which could also improve their knowledge of anticoagulation management, improve their quality of life, and reduce mortality and hospitalization events."
169,3,"Using technology to manage OACs can improve the effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulation management, result in higher patient satisfaction, and allow greater understanding of anticoagulation."
170,4,Diagnosing Parkinson Disease Through Facial Expression Recognition: Video Analysis
171,0,"The number of patients with neurological diseases is currently increasing annually, which presents tremendous challenges for both patients and doctors. "
172,0,"With the advent of advanced information technology, digital medical care is gradually changing the medical ecology. "
173,0,"Numerous people are exploring new ways to receive a consultation, track their diseases, and receive rehabilitation training in more convenient and efficient ways. "
174,0,"In this paper, we explore the use of facial expression recognition via artificial intelligence to diagnose a typical neurological system disease, Parkinson disease (PD)."
175,1,We collected videos of facial expressions of people with PD and matched controls. 
176,1,We used relative coordinates and positional jitter to extract facial expression features (facial expression amplitude and shaking of small facial muscle groups) from the key points returned by Face++. 
177,1,Algorithms from traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning were utilized to diagnose PD.
178,2,The experimental results showed our models can achieve outstanding facial expression recognition ability for PD diagnosis. 
179,2,"Applying a long short-term model neural network to the positions of the key features, precision and F1 values of 86% and 75%, respectively, can be reached. "
180,2,"Further, utilizing a support vector machine algorithm for the facial expression amplitude features and shaking of the small facial muscle groups, an F1 value of 99% can be achieved."
181,3,This study contributes to the digital diagnosis of PD based on facial expression recognition. 
182,3,The disease diagnosis model was validated through our experiment. 
183,3,The results can help doctors understand the real-time dynamics of the disease and even conduct remote diagnosis.
184,4,The Effects of Telemonitoring on Patient Compliance With Self-Management Recommendations and Outcomes of the Innovative Telemonitoring Enhanced Care Program for Chronic Heart Failure: Randomized Controlled Trial
185,0,"Telemonitoring enables care providers to remotely support outpatients in self-managing chronic heart failure (CHF), but the objective assessment of patient compliance with self-management recommendations has seldom been studied."
186,1,We conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial with a 6-month follow-up. 
187,1,The ITEC-CHF program comprised the provision of Bluetooth-enabled scales linked to a call center and nurse care services to assist participants with weight monitoring compliance. 
188,1,"Compliance was defined a priori as weighing at least 4 days per week, analyzed objectively from weight recordings on the scales. "
189,1,The intention-to-treat principle was used to perform the analysis.
190,2,"A total of 184 participants (141/184, 76.6% male), with a mean age of 70.1 (SD 12.3) years, were randomized to receive either ITEC-CHF (n=91) or usual care (control; n=93), of which 67 ITEC-CHF and 81 control participants completed the intervention. "
191,2,"For the compliance criterion of weighing at least 4 days per week, the proportion of compliant participants in the ITEC-CHF group was not significantly higher than that in the control group (ITEC-CHF: 67/91, 74% vs control: 56/91, 60%; P=.06). "
192,2,"However, the proportion of ITEC-CHF participants achieving the stricter compliance standard of at least 6 days a week was significantly higher than that in the control group (ITEC-CHF: 41/91, 45% vs control: 23/93, 25%; P=.005)."
193,3,"ITEC-CHF improved participant compliance with weight monitoring, although the withdrawal rate was high. "
194,3,Telemonitoring is a promising method for supporting both patients and clinicians in the management of CHF. 
195,3,"However, further refinements are required to optimize this model of care."
196,4,Effectiveness of a Transdiagnostic Guided Internet-Delivered Protocol for Emotional Disorders Versus Treatment as Usual in Specialized Care: Randomized Controlled Trial
197,0,Anxiety disorders and depression (emotional disorders) are highly prevalent mental disorders. 
198,0,Extensive empirical evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of these disorders. 
199,0,"However, there are still some barriers related to their dissemination and implementation, which make it difficult for patients to receive these treatments, especially in public health care settings where resources are limited. "
200,0,Recent advances in improving CBT dissemination encompass different perspectives. 
201,0,"One is the transdiagnostic approach, which offers treatment protocols that can be used for a range of emotional disorders. "
202,0,Another approach is the use of the internet to reach a larger number of people who could benefit from CBT.
203,1,A 2-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to compare the effectiveness of EmotionRegulation with treatment as usual (TAU) in specialized mental health care. 
204,1,"In all, 214 participants were randomly assigned to receive either EmotionRegulation (n=106) or TAU (n=108). "
205,1,Measurement assessments were conducted at pre- and postintervention and at a 3-month follow-up.
206,2,"The results revealed the superiority of EmotionRegulation over TAU on measures of depression (d=0.41), anxiety (d=0.35), and health-related quality of life (d=-0.45) at posttreatment, and these gains were maintained at the 3-month follow-up. "
207,2,"Furthermore, the results for expectations and opinions showed that EmotionRegulation was well accepted by participants."
208,3,EmotionRegulation was more effective than TAU for the treatment of emotional disorders in the Spanish public mental health system. 
209,3,"The implications of this RCT, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed."
210,4,"Impact of the Method of Delivering Electronic Health Behavior Change Interventions in Survivors of Cancer on Engagement, Health Behaviors, and Health Outcomes: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"
211,0,"Increased accessibility to the internet and mobile devices has seen a rapid expansion in electronic health (eHealth) behavior change interventions delivered to patients with cancer and survivors using synchronous, asynchronous, and combined delivery methods. "
212,0,Characterizing effective delivery methods of eHealth interventions is required to enable improved design and implementation of evidence-based health behavior change interventions.
213,1,"A search of Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, and PubMed was conducted for studies published between March 2007 and March 2019. "
214,1,We looked for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining interventions delivered to adult cancer survivors via eHealth methods with a measure of health behavior change. 
215,1,"Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to examine whether the method of eHealth delivery impacted the level of engagement, behavior change, and health outcomes."
216,2,A total of 24 RCTs were included predominantly examining dietary and physical activity behavior change interventions. 
217,2,"There were 11 studies that used a synchronous approach and 11 studies that used an asynchronous approach, whereas 2 studies used a combined delivery method. "
218,2,"Use of eHealth interventions improved exercise behavior (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.34, 95% CI 0.21-0.48), diet behavior (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.18-0.70), fatigue (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.50; SMD change 0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.35), anxiety (SMD 1.21, 95% CI: 0.36-2.07; SMD change 0.15, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.40), depression (SMD 0.15, 95% CI 0.00-0.30), and quality of life (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.34; SMD change 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.24). "
219,2,The mode of delivery did not influence the amount of dietary and physical activity behavior change observed.
220,3,"Physical activity and dietary behavior change eHealth interventions delivered to patients with cancer or survivors have a small to moderate impact on behavior change and a small to very small benefit to quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. "
221,3,There is insufficient evidence to determine whether asynchronous or synchronous delivery modes yield superior results. 
222,3,Three-arm RCTs comparing delivery modes with a control with robust engagement reporting are required to determine the most successful delivery method for promoting behavior change and ultimately favorable health outcomes.
223,4,Patient-Centric Scheduling With the Implementation of Health Information Technology to Improve the Patient Experience and Access to Care: Retrospective Case-Control Analysis
224,0,Cancellations and rescheduling of doctor's appointments are common. 
225,0,An automated rescheduling system has the potential to facilitate the rescheduling process so that newly opened slots are promptly filled by patients who need and can take the slot. 
226,0,"Building on an existing online patient portal, a large health care system adopted an automated rescheduling system, Fast Pass, that sends out an earlier appointment offer to patients via email or SMS text messaging and allows patients to reschedule their appointment through the online portal."
227,1,This study was a retrospective analysis of Fast Pass offers sent between July and December 2018. 
228,1,"Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the independent contribution of program, patient, and visit characteristics on the likelihood of accepting an offer. "
229,1,"We then assessed the appointment outcome (completion, cancellation, or no-show) of Fast Pass offered appointments compared to appointments with the same patient and visit characteristics, but without an offer."
230,2,"Of 177,311 Fast Pass offers sent, 14,717 (8.3%) were accepted. "
231,2,"Overall, there was a 1.3 percentage point (38%) reduction in no-show rates among Fast Pass accepted appointments compared to other appointments with matching characteristics (P<.001). "
232,2,"The offers were more likely to be accepted if they were sent in the evening (versus early morning), the first (versus repeated) offer for the same appointment, for a slot 1-31 days ahead (versus same-day), for later in a day (versus before 10am), for a primary care (versus specialty) visit, sent via SMS text messaging (versus email only), for an appointment made through the online patient portal (versus via phone call or in-person), or for younger adults aged 18-49 years (versus those aged 65 years or older; all at P<.001). "
233,2,Factors negatively associated with offer acceptance were a higher number of comorbidities (P=.02) and visits scheduled for chronic conditions (versus acute conditions only; P=.002).
234,3,"An automated rescheduling system can improve patients' access by reducing wait times for an appointment, with an added benefit of reducing no-shows by serving as a reminder of an upcoming appointment. "
235,3,"Future modifications, such as increasing the adoption of SMS text messaging offers and targeting older adults or patients with complex conditions, may make the system more patient-centered and help promote wider utilization."
236,4,Medical Mobile App Classification Using the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies: Interrater Reliability Study
237,0,"Clinical governance of medical mobile apps is challenging, and there is currently no standard method for assessing the quality of such apps. "
238,0,"In 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) developed a framework for assessing the required level of evidence for digital health technologies (DHTs), as determined by their clinical function. "
239,0,"The framework can potentially be used to assess mobile apps, which are a subset of DHTs. "
240,0,"To be used reliably in this context, the framework must allow unambiguous classification of an app's clinical function."
241,1,"We manually extracted app titles, screenshots, and content descriptions for all apps listed on the National Health Service (NHS) Apps Library website on July 12, 2019; none of the apps were downloaded. "
242,1,"Using this information, 2 mobile health (mHealth) researchers independently classified each app to one of the 4 functional tiers (ie, 1, 2, 3a, and 3b) described in the NICE digital technologies evaluation framework. "
243,1,Coders also answered contextual questions from the framework to identify whether apps were deemed to be higher risk. 
244,1,Agreement between coders was assessed using Cohen kappa statistic.
245,2,"In total, we assessed 76 apps from the NHS Apps Library. "
246,2,There was classification agreement for 42 apps. 
247,2,"Of these, 0 apps were unanimously classified into Tier 1; 24, into Tier 2; 15, into Tier 3a; and 3, into Tier 3b. "
248,2,"There was disagreement between coders in 34/76 cases (45%); interrater agreement was poor (Cohen kappa=0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.47). "
249,2,"Further investigation of disagreements highlighted 5 main explanatory themes: apps that did not correspond to any tier, apps that corresponded to multiple tiers, ambiguous tier descriptions, ambiguous app descriptions, and coder error."
250,3,The current iteration of the NICE evidence standards framework for DHTs did not allow mHealth researchers to consistently and unambiguously classify digital health mobile apps listed on the NHS app library according to their functional tier.
251,4,Digital Biomarkers of Social Anxiety Severity: Digital Phenotyping Using Passive Smartphone Sensors
252,0,Social anxiety disorder is a highly prevalent and burdensome condition. 
253,0,Persons with social anxiety frequently avoid seeking physician support and rarely receive treatment. 
254,0,"Social anxiety symptoms are frequently underreported and underrecognized, creating a barrier to the accurate assessment of these symptoms. "
255,0,"Consequently, more research is needed to identify passive biomarkers of social anxiety symptom severity. "
256,0,"Digital phenotyping, the use of passive sensor data to inform health care decisions, offers a possible method of addressing this assessment barrier."
257,1,"In this study, participants (n=59) completed self-report assessments of their social anxiety symptom severity, depressive symptom severity, positive affect, and negative affect. "
258,1,"Next, participants installed an app, which passively collected data about their movement (accelerometers) and social contact (incoming and outgoing calls and texts) over 2 weeks. "
259,1,"Afterward, these passive sensor data were used to form digital biomarkers, which were paired with machine learning models to predict participants' social anxiety symptom severity."
260,2,"The results suggested that these passive sensor data could be utilized to accurately predict participants' social anxiety symptom severity (r=0.702 between predicted and observed symptom severity) and demonstrated discriminant validity between depression, negative affect, and positive affect."
261,3,"These results suggest that smartphone sensor data may be utilized to accurately detect social anxiety symptom severity and discriminate social anxiety symptom severity from depressive symptoms, negative affect, and positive affect."
262,4,Mediating Effect of Internet Addiction on the Relationship Between Individualism and Cyberbullying: Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study
263,0,"Among a variety of dynamics that may have effects on internet-related behaviors, cultural orientation is particularly important. "
264,0,Previous studies suggest that individualism is a strong determinant of certain behaviors. 
265,0,"In addition, findings suggest that vertical individualism may lead to the development of more tolerance for addiction and aggression on the internet."
266,1,A total of 665 college students were selected using a convenience sampling method and willingly participated in the study. 
267,1,"Participants' ages ranged from 17 to 19 years (mean 17.94 years, SD 1.12 years). "
268,1,"Of the group, 462 were women (462/665, 69.5%), and 203 were men (203/665, 30.5%). "
269,1,"Study majors represented were mathematics (113/665, 17%), sciences (102/665, 15.3%), instructional technology (99/665, 14.9%), psychology (98/665, 14.7%), and others (253/665, 38.1%). "
270,1,"Self-report instruments were used to measure vertical/horizontal individualism, cyberbullying, and internet addiction."
271,2,Results show a significant positive effect of vertical individualism (effect size 0.10) and significant negative effect of horizontal individualism (effect size -0.12) on cyberbullying. 
272,2,"In addition, the direct effect of vertical individualism on internet addiction was significant (effect size 0.28), but the direct effect of horizontal individualism was not (effect size -0.05). "
273,2,Internet addiction had a significant direct effect on cyberbullying (effect size 0.39) as well as an intervening effect on the relationship between vertical individualism and cyberbullying. 
274,2,Results also indicate significant gender differences in cultural patterns and internet addiction.
275,3,The findings suggest that horizontal and vertical individualism have significant effects on internet addiction. 
276,3,The findings also suggest that vertical individualists are more vulnerable to internet addiction. 
277,3,"Further, the findings indicate a significant relationship between internet addiction and cyberbullying."
278,4,Use of Smartphones to Detect Diabetic Retinopathy: Scoping Review and Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies
279,0,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common complication of diabetes mellitus, is the leading cause of impaired vision in adults worldwide. "
280,0,Smartphone ophthalmoscopy involves using a smartphone camera for digital retinal imaging. 
281,0,"Utilizing smartphones to detect DR is potentially more affordable, accessible, and easier to use than conventional methods."
282,1,"We performed an electronic search on the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for literature published from January 2000 to November 2018. "
283,1,"We included studies involving diabetic patients, which compared the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone ophthalmoscopy for detecting DR to an accurate or commonly employed reference standard, such as indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and tabletop fundus photography. "
284,1,"Two reviewers independently screened studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool, with disagreements resolved via consensus. "
285,1,Sensitivity and specificity were pooled using the random effects model. 
286,1,A summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was constructed. 
287,1,This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies guidelines.
288,2,"In all, nine studies involving 1430 participants were included. "
289,2,"Most studies were of high quality, except one study with limited applicability because of its reference standard The pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting any DR was 87% (95% CI 74%-94%) and 94% (95% CI 81%-98%); mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR) was 39% (95% CI 10%-79%) and 95% (95% CI 91%-98%); moderate NPDR was 71% (95% CI 57%-81%) and 95% (95% CI 88%-98%); severe NPDR was 80% (95% CI 49%-94%) and 97% (95% CI 88%-99%); proliferative DR (PDR) was 92% (95% CI 79%-97%) and 99% (95% CI 96%-99%); diabetic macular edema was 79% (95% CI 63%-89%) and 93% (95% CI 82%-97%); and referral-warranted DR was 91% (95% CI 86%-94%) and 89% (95% CI 56%-98%). "
290,2,The area under SROC curve ranged from 0.879 to 0.979. 
291,2,The diagnostic odds ratio ranged from 11.3 to 1225.
292,3,We found heterogeneous evidence showing that smartphone ophthalmoscopy performs well in detecting DR. 
293,3,The diagnostic accuracy for PDR was highest. 
294,3,Future studies should standardize reference criteria and classification criteria and evaluate other available forms of smartphone ophthalmoscopy in primary care settings.
295,4,Effectiveness of Message Frame-Tailoring in a Web-Based Smoking Cessation Program: Randomized Controlled Trial
296,0,"The content of online computer-tailored interventions is often determined to match an individual's characteristics, beliefs, and behavioral factors. "
297,0,These content-tailored interventions lead to better message processing and a higher likelihood of behavior change such as smoking cessation. 
298,0,"However, a meta-analysis of online computer-tailored interventions showed that effect sizes, albeit positive, remain small, suggesting room for improvement. "
299,0,"A promising strategy to enhance the effectiveness of online computer-tailored interventions is to tailor the message frame (ie, how a message is communicated) based on the preferred communication style of the user in addition to content-tailoring. "
300,0,"One factor that determines an individual's communication style preference is the need for autonomy; some individuals prefer an autonomy-supportive communication style (offering choice and use of suggestive language), whereas others might prefer a directive communication style, which is replete with imperatives and does not provide choice. "
301,0,"Tailoring how messages are presented (eg, based on the need for autonomy) is called message frame-tailoring."
302,1,A randomized controlled trial with a 2 (message frame-tailoring vs no message frame-tailoring) by 2 (content-tailoring vs no content-tailoring) design was conducted among adult smokers intending to quit smoking (N=273).
303,2,"Structural equation modeling revealed that the content-tailored condition increased smoking abstinence rates 1 month after the start of the intervention (beta=.57, P=.02). "
304,2,"However, neither message frame-tailoring nor its interaction with content-tailoring significantly predicted smoking abstinence. "
305,2,"In our model, message frame-tailoring, content-tailoring, as well as their interaction significantly predicted perceived relevance of the smoking cessation messages, which consequently predicted self-determined motivation. "
306,2,"In turn, self-determined motivation positively affected attitudes and self-efficacy for smoking cessation, but only self-efficacy consequently predicted smoking abstinence. "
307,2,"Participants in the control condition perceived the highest level of message relevance (mean 4.78, SD 1.27). "
308,2,"However, messages that were frame-tailored for individuals with a high need for autonomy in combination with content-tailored messages led to significantly higher levels of perceived message relevance (mean 4.83, SD 1.03) compared to those receiving content-tailored messages only (mean 4.24, SD 1.05, P=.003)."
309,3,"Message frame-tailoring based on the need for autonomy seems to be an effective addition to conventional content-tailoring techniques in online smoking cessation interventions for people with a high need for autonomy; however, this is not effective in its current form for people with a low need for autonomy."
310,4,Use of Telephone and Digital Channels to Engage Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Adults in Health Disparities Research Within a Social Service Setting: Cross-Sectional Study
311,0,"Engaging socioeconomically disadvantaged populations in health research is vital to understanding and, ultimately, eliminating health-related disparities. "
312,0,"Digital communication channels are increasingly used to recruit study participants, and recent trends indicate a growing need to partner with the social service sector to improve population health. "
313,0,"However, few studies have recruited participants from social service settings using multiple digital channels."
314,1,"The Cancer Communication Channels in Context Study recruited and surveyed adult clients of 2-1-1, a social service-focused information and referral system, using five channels: telephone, website, text message, web-based live chat, and email. "
315,1,"Participants completed surveys administered either by phone (if recruited by phone) or on the web (if recruited from digital channels, ie, website, text message, Web-based live chat, or email). "
316,1,Measures for the current analysis included demographic and health characteristics.
317,2,"A total of 3293 participants were recruited, with 1907 recruited by phone and 1386 recruited from digital channels. "
318,2,Those recruited by phone had a moderate study eligibility rate (42.23%) and the highest survey completion rate (91.24%) of all channels. 
319,2,Individuals recruited by text message had a high study eligibility rate (94.14%) yet the lowest survey completion rate (74.0%) of all channels. 
320,2,"Sample accrual goals were achieved for phone, text message, and website recruitment. "
321,2,Multivariable analyses found differences in participant characteristics by recruitment channel type. 
322,2,"Compared with participants recruited by phone, those recruited from digital channels were younger (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.96-0.97) and more likely to be female (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.23-1.88), married (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22-1.89), and other than non-Hispanic black (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.22-1.79). "
323,2,"Those recruited via phone also were more likely to have more than a high school education (aOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.67-2.82), have a household income =US $25,000 a year (aOR 2.02, 95% CI 1.56-2.61), and have children living in the home (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.51). "
324,2,"Additionally, participants recruited from digital channels were less likely than those recruited by phone to have public health insurance (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90) and more likely to report better overall health (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.27-1.83 for good-to-excellent health)."
325,3,"Findings indicate the feasibility and utility of recruiting socioeconomically disadvantaged adults from the social service sector using multiple communication channels, including digital channels. "
326,3,"As social service-based health research evolves, strategic recruitment using a combination of traditional and digital channels may be warranted to avoid underrepresentation of highly medically vulnerable individuals, which could exacerbate disparities in health."
327,4,Patterns in Weight and Physical Activity Tracking Data Preceding a Stop in Weight Monitoring: Observational Analysis
328,0,"Self-regulation for weight loss requires regular self-monitoring of weight, but the frequency of weight tracking commonly declines over time."
329,1,"We analyzed weight and physical activity data from 1605 Withings Health Mate app users, who had set a weight loss goal and stopped tracking their weight for at least six weeks after a minimum of 16 weeks of continuous tracking. "
330,1,"Mixed effects models compared weight change, average daily steps, and physical activity tracking frequency between a 4-week period of continuous tracking and a 4-week period preceding the stop in weight tracking. "
331,1,Additional mixed effects models investigated subsequent changes in physical activity data during 4 weeks of the 6-week long stop in weight tracking.
332,2,"People lost weight during continuous tracking (mean -0.47 kg, SD 1.73) but gained weight preceding the stop in weight tracking (mean 0.25 kg, SD 1.62; difference 0.71 kg; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.81). "
333,2,Average daily steps (beta=-220 daily steps per time period; 95% CI -320 to -120) and physical activity tracking frequency (beta= 3.4 days per time period; 95% CI -3.8 to -3.1) significantly declined from the continuous tracking to the pre-stop period. 
334,2,"From pre-stop to post-stop, physical activity tracking frequency further decreased (beta=-6.6 days per time period; 95% CI -7.12 to -6.16), whereas daily step count on the day's activity was measured increased (beta=110 daily steps per time period; 95% CI 50 to 170)."
335,3,"In the weeks before people stop tracking their weight, their physical activity and physical activity monitoring frequency decline. "
336,3,"At the same time, weight increases, suggesting that declining motivation for weight control and difficulties with making use of negative weight feedback might explain why people stop tracking their weight. "
337,3,The increase in daily steps but decrease in physical activity tracking frequency post-stop might result from selective measurement of more active days.
338,4,Twitter Analysis of the Nonmedical Use and Side Effects of Methylphenidate: Machine Learning Study
339,0,"Methylphenidate, a stimulant used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, has the potential to be used nonmedically, such as for studying and recreation. "
340,0,"In an era when many people actively use social networking services, experience with the nonmedical use or side effects of methylphenidate might be shared on Twitter."
341,1,"A total of 34,293 tweets mentioning methylphenidate from August 2018 to July 2019 were collected using searches for ""methylphenidate"" and its brand names. "
342,1,"Tweets in a randomly selected training dataset (6860/34,293, 20.00%) were annotated as positive or negative for two dependent variables: nonmedical use and side effects. "
343,1,"Features such as personal noun, nonmedical use terms, medical use terms, side effect terms, sentiment scores, and the presence of a URL were generated for supervised learning. "
344,1,"Using the labeled training dataset and features, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were built and the performance was evaluated using F-1 scores. "
345,1,The classifiers were applied to the test dataset to determine the number of tweets about nonmedical use and side effects.
346,2,"Of the 6860 tweets in the training dataset, 5.19% (356/6860) and 5.52% (379/6860) were about nonmedical use and side effects, respectively. "
347,2,"Performance of SVM classifiers for nonmedical use and side effects, expressed as F-1 scores, were 0.547 (precision: 0.926, recall: 0.388, and accuracy: 0.967) and 0.733 (precision: 0.920, recall: 0.609, and accuracy: 0.976), respectively. "
348,2,"In the test dataset, the SVM classifiers identified 361 tweets (1.32%) about nonmedical use and 519 tweets (1.89%) about side effects. "
349,2,"The proportion of tweets about nonmedical use was highest in May 2019 (46/2624, 1.75%) and December 2018 (36/2041, 1.76%)."
350,3,The SVM classifiers that were built in this study were highly precise and accurate and will help to automatically identify the nonmedical use and side effects of methylphenidate using Twitter.
351,4,Adherence to Electronic Health Tools Among Vulnerable Groups: Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis
352,0,Electronic health (eHealth) tools are increasingly being applied in health care. 
353,0,"They are expected to improve access to health care, quality of health care, and health outcomes. "
354,0,"Although the advantages of using these tools in health care are well described, it is unknown to what extent eHealth tools are effective when used by vulnerable population groups, such as the elderly, people with low socioeconomic status, single parents, minorities, or immigrants."
355,1,"In this systematic review, we assessed the design and implementation characteristics of eHealth tools that are used by vulnerable groups. "
356,1,"In the meta-analysis, we used the adherence rate as an effect size measure. "
357,1,"The adherence rate is defined as the number of people who are repetitive users (ie, use the eHealth tool more than once). "
358,1,We also performed a meta-regression analysis to examine how different design and implementation characteristics influenced the adherence rate.
359,2,"Currently, eHealth tools are continuously used by vulnerable groups but to a small extent. "
360,2,eHealth tools that use multimodal content (such as videos) and have the possibility for direct communication with providers show improved adherence among vulnerable groups.
361,3,eHealth tools that use multimodal content and provide the possibility for direct communication with providers have a higher adherence among vulnerable groups. 
362,3,"However, most of the eHealth tools are not embedded within the health care system. "
363,3,"They are usually focused on specific problems, such as diabetes or obesity. "
364,3,"Hence, they do not provide comprehensive services for patients. "
365,3,This limits the use of eHealth tools as a replacement for existing health care services.
366,4,The Impact of Advertisement Messaging on Enrollment of Young Men Who Have Sex With Men for Web-Based Research: Observational Study
367,0,Recruiting young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in community settings is difficult. 
368,0,"The use of Web-based social networks and dating apps for recruitment can be successful approaches, although little work has been done on the impact of study advertisement content on recruitment."
369,1,"Between March and April 2017, a recruitment campaign to promote human papillomavirus vaccination was launched on a popular social networking and dating app for YMSM, with 3 different text-based advertisement themes (technology, cancer prevention, and sexual innuendo). "
370,1,"The campaign recruited YMSM across 3 states (Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania). "
371,1,"We examined the click-through rates, conversion rates, and enrollment rates of each of the advertisements and examined differences in views and clicks by age, state, and time of day."
372,2,"The sexual innuendo advertisement had the highest click rates when compared with both the technology (click rate ratio [CRR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.74-2.45) and cancer prevention (CRR 1.62, 95% CI 1.38-1.90) advertisements. "
373,2,"The sexual innuendo advertisement also had higher study enrollment rates compared with the technology (CRR 1.90, 95% CI 1.23-2.83) and cancer prevention (CRR 2.06, 95% CI 1.37-3.13) advertisements. "
374,2,"No differences were observed in clicks or enrollment by age, state, or time of day."
375,3,"Our marketing campaign, targeting YMSM, was effective in recruiting participants for a qualitative study, using Web based focus groups. "
376,3,The sexual innuendo advertisement was the most effective and cost-efficient advertisement of the 3 approaches trialed. 
377,3,Different populations need different targeted strategies for study recruitment. 
378,3,Researchers should work with key representatives to develop and test culturally relevant messaging and approaches that utilize current and popular technologies.
379,4,Digital Alerting and Outcomes in Patients With Sepsis: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
380,0,The diagnosis and management of sepsis remain a global health care challenge. 
381,0,Digital technologies have the potential to improve sepsis care.
382,1,"The following databases were searched for studies published from April 1964 to February 12, 2019, with no language restriction: EMBASE, MEDLINE, HMIC, PsycINFO, and Cochrane. "
383,1,All full-text reports of studies identified as potentially eligible after title and abstract reviews were obtained for further review. 
384,1,The search was limited to adult inpatients. 
385,1,Relevant articles were hand searched for other studies. 
386,1,Only studies with clear pre- and postalerting phases were included. 
387,1,"Primary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and intensive care LOS, whereas secondary outcomes were time to antibiotics and mortality. "
388,1,"Studies based solely on intensive care, case reports, narrative reviews, editorials, and commentaries were excluded. "
389,1,All other trial designs were included. 
390,1,A qualitative assessment and meta-analysis were performed.
391,2,This review identified 72 full-text articles. 
392,2,"From these, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. "
393,2,"Of these, 8 studies reviewed hospital LOS, 12 reviewed mortality outcomes, 5 studies explored time to antibiotics, and 5 studies investigated intensive care unit (ICU) LOS. "
394,2,Both quantitative and qualitative assessments of the studies were performed. 
395,2,"There was evidence of a significant benefit of digital alerting in hospital LOS, which reduced by 1.31 days (P=.014), and ICU LOS, which reduced by 0.766 days (P=.007). "
396,2,There was no significant association between digital alerts and mortality (mean decrease 11.4%; P=.77) or time to antibiotics (mean decrease 126 min; P=.13).
397,3,This review highlights that digital alerts can considerably reduce hospital and ICU stay for patients with sepsis. 
398,3,Further studies including randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm these findings and identify the choice of alerting system according to the patient status and pathological cohort.
399,4,Cost and Effectiveness of Using Facebook Advertising to Recruit Young Women for Research: PREFER (Contraceptive Preferences Study) Experience
400,0,Social media is a popular and convenient method for communicating on the Web. 
401,0,"The most commonly used social networking website, Facebook, is increasingly being used as a tool for recruiting research participants because of its large user base and its ability to target advertisements on the basis of Facebook users' information."
402,1,"We placed an advertisement on Facebook over a 19-day period from December 2017 to January 2018, inviting 16- to 25-year-old women from Australia to participate in a Web-based study about contraception. "
403,1,"Those who clicked on the advertisement were directed to project information, and their eligibility was determined by using a screening survey."
404,2,"Our Facebook advertisement delivered 130,129 impressions, resulting in over 2000 clicks at an overall cost of Aus $918 (Aus $0.44 per click). "
405,2,Web-based project information was accessed by 493 women. 
406,2,"Of these, 462 women completed the screening survey, and 437 (437/463, 95%) women were eligible. "
407,2,"A total of 322 young women participated in Surveys 1 and 2 (74% response rate), and 284 women participated in Survey 3 (88% retention rate), with an advertising cost of Aus $2.85 per consenting participant."
408,3,"Facebook proved to be a quick, effective, and cost-efficient tool for recruiting young Australian women into a study that was investigating contraceptive preferences. "
409,3,"However, Web-based recruitment may result in sociodemographic biases. "
410,3,Further research is required to evaluate whether Facebook is suitable for recruiting older study populations.
411,4,Investigating Software Requirements for Systems Supporting Task-Shifted Interventions: Usability Study
412,0,"There is a considerable shortfall in specialized health care professionals worldwide to deliver health services, and this shortfall is especially pronounced in low-middle-income countries. "
413,0,"This has led to the implementation of task-shifted interventions, in which specific tasks are moved away from highly qualified health workers to health workers with less training. "
414,0,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has published recommendations for such interventions, but guidelines for software and systems supporting such interventions are not included."
415,1,"Using a set of recommendations based on the WHO's guidance documentation for task-shifted interventions, we identified 9 software requirements that aim to support health workers in management and supervision, training, good relationship with other health workers, and community embeddedness of the intervention. "
416,1,"These 9 software requirements were used to implement a system for the provision of a psychosocial depression intervention with mobile Android interfaces to structure interventions and collect data, and Web interfaces for supervision and support of the health care workers delivering the intervention. "
417,1,The system was tested in a 2-arm pilot study with 33 patients and 11 health workers. 
418,1,"In all, 8 of these 11 health workers participated in a usability study subsequent to the pilot."
419,2,The qualitative and quantitative feedback obtained with the System Usability Scale suggest that the system was deemed to have a usability of between OK and Good. 
420,2,"Nevertheless, some participants' responses indicated that they felt they needed technical assistance to use the system. "
421,2,"This was reinforced by answers obtained with perceived usefulness and ease of use questionnaires, which indicated some users felt that they had issues around correct use of the system and perceived ability to become skillful at using the system."
422,3,"Overall, these high-level requirements adequately captured the functionality required to enable the health workers to provide the intervention successfully. "
423,3,"Nevertheless, the analysis of results indicated that some improvements were required for the system to be useable in a task-shifted intervention. "
424,3,"The most important of these were better access to a training environment, access for supervisors to metadata such as duration of sessions or exercises to identify issues, and a more robust and human-error-proof approach to the availability of patient data on the mobile devices used during the intervention."
425,4,A Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence for Communication Skills Training in Nursing Education: Development Study
426,0,"The ability of nursing undergraduates to communicate effectively with health care providers, patients, and their family members is crucial to their nursing professions as these can affect patient outcomes. "
427,0,"However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. "
428,0,"Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings."
429,1,"The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. "
430,1,"An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D."
431,2,"The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. "
432,2,"Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training."
433,3,The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. 
434,3,"However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation."
435,4,"Reduced Hospitalizations, Emergency Room Visits, and Costs Associated with a Web-Based Health Literacy, Aligned-Incentive Intervention: Mixed Methods Study"
436,0,"The association between health literacy and health care costs, particularly for hospitalizations and emergency room services, has been previously observed. "
437,0,Health information interventions aimed at addressing the negative impacts of inadequate health literacy are needed. 
438,0,The MedEncentive Mutual Accountability and Information Therapy (MAIT) Program is a Web-based system designed to improve health and lower costs by aligning patient-doctor incentives.
439,1,"We used a mixed methods, single within-group, pre-post, descriptive study design. "
440,1,We analyzed quantitative data using pre-post mean utilization and cost differences and summarized the data using descriptive statistics. 
441,1,We used open-ended electronic survey items to collect descriptive data and analyzed them using thematic content analysis.
442,2,"Hospitalizations and emergency room visits per 1000 decreased 32% (26.5/82.4) and 14% (31.3/219.9), respectively, after we implemented the program in 2015-2017, relative to 2013-2014. "
443,2,"Correspondingly, the plan's annual per capita expenditures declined US $675 (95% CI US $470-865), or 10.8% ($675/$6260), after program implementation in 2015-2017 (US $5585 in 2013-2014 dollars), relative to the baseline years of 2013-2014 (US $6260; P<.05). "
444,2,"Qualitative findings suggested that respondents valued the program, benefiting from its educational and motivational aspects to better self-manage their health."
445,3,"Analyses suggested that the reported reductions in hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and costs were associated with the program. "
446,3,Qualitative findings indicated that targeted users perceived value in participating in the MAIT Program. 
447,3,"Further research with controls is needed to confirm these outcomes and more completely understand the health improvement and cost-containment capabilities of this Web-based health information, patient-doctor, aligned-incentive program."
448,4,The Effect of Robot Attentional Behaviors on User Perceptions and Behaviors in a Simulated Health Care Interaction: Randomized Controlled Trial
449,0,"For robots to be effectively used in health applications, they need to display appropriate social behaviors. "
450,0,"A fundamental requirement in all social interactions is the ability to engage, maintain, and demonstrate attention. "
451,0,"Attentional behaviors include leaning forward, self-disclosure, and changes in voice pitch."
452,1,A parallel randomized controlled trial with a 1:1:1 allocation ration was conducted. 
453,1,We randomized participants to 1 of 4 experimental conditions before engaging in a scripted face-to-face interaction with a fully automated medical receptionist robot. 
454,1,"Experimental conditions included a self-disclosure condition, voice pitch change condition, forward lean condition, and neutral condition. "
455,1,"Participants completed paper-based postinteraction measures relating to engagement, perceived robot attention, and perceived robot empathy. "
456,1,We video recorded interactions and coded for participant attentional behaviors.
457,2,A total of 181 participants were recruited from the University of Auckland. 
458,2,Participants who interacted with the robot in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions found the robot to be significantly more stimulating than those who interacted with the robot in the voice pitch or neutral conditions (P=.03). 
459,2,"Participants in the forward lean, self-disclosure, and neutral conditions found the robot to be significantly more interesting than those in the voice pitch condition (P<.001). "
460,2,Participants in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions spent significantly more time looking at the robot than participants in the neutral condition (P<.001). 
461,2,"Significantly, more participants in the self-disclosure condition laughed during the interaction (P=.01), whereas significantly more participants in the forward lean condition leant toward the robot during the interaction (P<.001)."
462,3,The use of self-disclosure and forward lean by a health care robot can increase human engagement and attentional behaviors. 
463,3,Voice pitch changes did not increase attention or engagement. 
464,3,The small effects with regard to participant perceptions are potentially because of the limitations in self-report measures or a lack of comparison for most participants who had never interacted with a robot before. 
465,3,Further research could explore the use of self-disclosure and forward lean using a within-subjects design and in real health care settings.
466,4,Disparities in Electronic Patient Portal Use in Prenatal Care: Retrospective Cohort Study
467,0,Electronic patient portals are websites that provide individuals access to their personal health records and allow them to engage through a secure Web-based platform. 
468,0,These portals are becoming increasingly popular in contemporary health care systems. 
469,0,"Patient portal use has been found to be beneficial in multiple specialties, especially in the management of chronic disease. "
470,0,"However, disparities have been identified in portal use in which racial and ethnic minorities and individuals with lower socioeconomic status have been shown to be less likely to enroll and use patient portals than non-Hispanic white persons and individuals with higher socioeconomic status. "
471,0,"Electronic patient portal use by childbearing women has not been well studied, and data on portal use during pregnancy are limited."
472,1,This was a retrospective cohort study of women who received prenatal care at an academic medical center from 2014 to 2016. 
473,1,Clinical records were reviewed for portal use and patient data. 
474,1,"Patients were considered enrolled in the portal if they had an account at the time of delivery, and enrollees were compared with nonenrollees. "
475,1,Enrollees were further categorized based on the number of secure messages sent during pregnancy as active (>= 1) or inactive (0) users. 
476,1,"Bivariable chi-square and multivariable Poisson regression models were used to calculate the incidence rate ratio of portal enrollment and, if enrolled, of active use based on patients' characteristics."
477,2,"Of the 3450 women eligible for inclusion, 2530 (73.33%) enrolled in the portal. "
478,2,"Of these enrollees, 72.09% (1824/2530) were active users. "
479,2,There was no difference in portal enrollment by maternal race and ethnicity on multivariable models. 
480,2,"Women with public insurance (adjusted incidence rate ratio; aIRR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49-0.84), late enrollment in prenatal care (aIRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69-0.89 for second trimester and aIRR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39-0.64 for third trimester), and high-risk pregnancies (aIRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75-0.89) were significantly less likely to enroll. "
481,2,"Conversely, nulliparity (aIRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.20) and having more than 8 prescription medications at prenatal care initiation (aIRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.32) were associated with greater likelihood of enrollment. "
482,2,"Among portal enrollees, the only factor significantly associated with active portal use (ie, secure messaging) was nulliparity (aIRR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.23)."
483,3,"Among an obstetric population, multiple clinical and socioeconomic factors were associated with electronic portal enrollment, but not subsequent active use. "
484,3,"As portals become more integrated as tools to promote health, efforts should be made to ensure that already vulnerable populations are not further disadvantaged with regard to electronic-based care."
485,4,Underage JUUL Use Patterns: Content Analysis of Reddit Messages
486,0,"The popularity of JUUL (an e-cigarette brand) among youth has recently been reported in news media and academic papers, which has raised great public health concerns. "
487,0,"Little research has been conducted on the age distribution, geographic distribution, approaches to buying JUUL, and flavor preferences pertaining to underage JUUL users."
488,1,We collected publicly available JUUL-related data from Reddit. 
489,1,"We extracted and summarized the age, location, and flavor preference of subreddit UnderageJuul users. "
490,1,We also compared common and unique users between subreddit UnderageJuul and subreddit JUUL. 
491,1,The methods of purchasing JUULs were analyzed by manually examining the content of the Reddit threads.
492,2,A total of 716 threads and 2935 comments were collected from the subreddit UnderageJuul before it was shut down. 
493,2,"Most threads did not mention a specific age, but ages ranged from 13 years to greater than 21 years in those that did. "
494,2,"Mango, mint, and cucumber were the most popular among the 7 flavors listed on JUUL's official website, and 336 subreddit UnderageJuul threads mentioned 7 discreet approaches to circumvent relevant legal regulations to get JUUL products, the most common of which was purchasing JUUL from other Reddit users (n=181). "
495,2,"Almost half of the UnderageJuul users (389/844, 46.1%) also participated in discussions on the main JUUL subreddit and sought information across multiple Reddit forums. "
496,2,"Most (64/74, 86%) posters were from large metropolitan areas."
497,3,The subreddit UnderageJuul functioned as a forum to explore methods of obtaining JUUL and to discuss and recommend specific flavors before it was shut down. 
498,3,"About half of those using UnderageJuul also used the more general JUUL subreddit, so a forum still exists where youths can attempt to share information on how to obtain JUUL and other products. "
499,3,Exploration of such social media data in real time for rapid public health surveillance could provide early warning for significant health risks before they become major public health threats.
500,4,"Literature on Wearable Technology for Connected Health: Scoping Review of Research Trends, Advances, and Barriers"
501,0,Wearable sensing and information and communication technologies are key enablers driving the transformation of health care delivery toward a new model of connected health (CH) care. 
502,0,"The advances in wearable technologies in the last decade are evidenced in a plethora of original articles, patent documentation, and focused systematic reviews. "
503,0,"Although technological innovations continuously respond to emerging challenges and technology availability further supports the evolution of CH solutions, the widespread adoption of wearables remains hindered."
504,1,This study followed the scoping review methodology to identify and process the available literature. 
505,1,"As the scope surpasses the possibilities of manual search, we relied on the natural language processing tool kit to ensure an efficient and exhaustive search of the literature corpus in three large digital libraries: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, PubMed, and Springer. "
506,1,The search was based on the keywords and properties to be found in articles using the search engines of the digital libraries.
507,2,The annual number of publications in all segments of research on wearable technology shows an increasing trend from 2010 to February 2019. 
508,2,"The technology-related topics dominated in the number of contributions, followed by research on information delivery, safety, and security, whereas user-related concerns were the topic least addressed. "
509,2,"The literature corpus evidences milestones in sensor technology (miniaturization and placement), communication architectures and fifth generation (5G) cellular network technology, data analytics, and evolution of cloud and edge computing architectures. "
510,2,The research lag in battery technology makes energy efficiency a relevant consideration in the design of both sensors and network architectures with computational offloading. 
511,2,"The most addressed user-related concerns were (technology) acceptance and privacy, whereas research gaps indicate that more efforts should be invested into formalizing clear use cases with timely and valuable feedback and prescriptive recommendations."
512,3,"This study confirms that applications of wearable technology in the CH domain are becoming mature and established as a scientific domain The current research should bring progress to sustainable delivery of valuable recommendations, enforcement of privacy by design, energy-efficient pervasive sensing, seamless monitoring, and low-latency 5G communications. "
513,3,"To complement technology achievements, future work involving all stakeholders providing research evidence on improved care pathways and cost-effectiveness of the CH model is needed."
514,4,Telehealth Interventions for Improving Self-Management in Patients With Hemophilia: Scoping Review of Clinical Studies
515,0,The introduction of home therapy for hemophilia has empowered patients and their families to manage the disease more independently. 
516,0,"However, self-management of hemophilia is demanding and complex. "
517,0,"The uses of innovative interventions delivered by telehealth routes such as social media and Web-based and mobile apps, may help monitor bleeding events and promote the appropriate use of clotting factors among patients with hemophilia."
518,1,"A search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases for studies that (1) focused on patients with hemophilia A or B; (2) tested the use of remote telehealth interventions via the internet, wireless, satellite, telephone, and mobile phone media on patients and caregivers; and (3) reported on at least one of the following patient-/caregiver-focused outcomes related to empowering patients/caregivers to be active decision makers in the emotional, social, and medical management of the illness: quality of life, monitoring of bleeding episodes, joint damage or other measures of functional status, medication adherence, and patients' knowledge. "
519,1,"Implementation outcomes (user metrics, cost saving, and accuracy of electronic records) were also evaluated. "
520,1,"Reviews, commentaries, and case reports comprising <= 10 cases were excluded."
521,2,Sixteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 
522,2,"The majority of the interventions (10/16, 62%) evaluated both implementation outcomes and patient-/caregiver-focused outcomes. "
523,2,"User performance and accuracy and comprehensiveness of electronic records were also measured in most studies (4/16, 87%). "
524,2,"The components of the interventions were rather homogenous and typically involved electronic logging and reminders for prophylactic infusions, reporting of spontaneous and traumatic bleeding events, monitoring of infusion product usage and home inventory, and real-time communication with health care professionals and hemophilia clinics. "
525,2,Telemedicine-supported education and information interventions seemed to be particularly effective among adolescent and young adult patients. 
526,2,"Although the patients reported improvements in their health-related quality of life and perception of illness, telemonitoring devices did not appear to have a significant effect on quantifiable health outcomes such as joint health. "
527,2,Longitudinal studies seemed to suggest that the response and adherence rates to recording decreased over time.
528,3,Preliminary evidence from this review suggests that telehealth-delivered interventions could feasibly improve patients' adherence to medication use and promote independence in disease management. 
529,3,"Given the complexity and resources involved in developing a mature and established system, support from a dedicated network of hemophilia specialists and data managers will be required to maintain the technology, improve adherence to prophylactic treatment and recording, and validate the electronic data locally."
530,4,The Potential of Blockchain Technology for Health Information Exchange: Experimental Study From Patients Perspectives
531,0,"Nowadays, a number of mechanisms and tools are being used by health care organizations and physicians to electronically exchange the personal health information of patients. "
532,0,"The main objectives of different methods of health information exchange (HIE) are to reduce health care costs, minimize medical errors, and improve the coordination of interorganizational information exchange across health care entities. "
533,0,"The main challenges associated with the common HIE systems are privacy concerns, security risks, low visibility of system transparency, and lack of patient control. "
534,0,Blockchain technology is likely to disrupt the current information exchange models utilized in the health care industry.
535,1,"To recognize the potential applications of blockchain technology in health care practices, we designed 16 information exchange scenarios for controlled Web-based experiments. "
536,1,"Overall, 2013 respondents participated in 16 Web-based experiments. "
537,1,"Each experiment described an information exchange condition characterized by 4 exchange mechanisms (ie, direct, lookup, patient-centered, and blockchain), 2 types of health information (ie, sensitive vs nonsensitive), and 2 types of privacy policy (weak vs strong)."
538,2,"The findings show that there are significant differences in patients' perceptions of various exchange mechanisms with regard to patient privacy concern, trust in competency and integrity, opt-in intention, and willingness to share information. "
539,2,"Interestingly, participants hold a favorable attitude toward the implementation of blockchain-based exchange mechanisms for privacy protection, coordination, and information exchange purposes. "
540,2,This study proposed the potentials and limitations of a blockchain-based attempt in the HIE context.
541,3,The results of this research should be of interest to both academics and practitioners. 
542,3,The findings propose potential limitations of a blockchain-based HIE that should be addressed by health care organizations to exchange personal health information in a secure and private manner. 
543,3,This study can contribute to the research in the blockchain area and enrich the literature on the use of blockchain in HIE efforts. 
544,3,Practitioners can also identify how to leverage the benefit of blockchain to promote HIE initiatives nationwide.
545,4,Examining Cost Measurements in Production and Delivery of Three Case Studies Using E-Learning for Applied Health Sciences: Cross-Case Synthesis
546,0,The World Health Report (2006) by the World Health Organization conveys that a significant increase is needed in global health care resourcing to meet the current and future demand for health professionals. 
547,0,"Electronic learning (e-Learning) presents a possible opportunity to change and optimize training by providing a scalable means for instruction, thus reducing the costs for training health professionals and providing patient education. "
548,0,"Research literature often suggests that a benefit of e-Learning is its cost-effectiveness compared with face-to-face instruction, yet there is limited evidence with respect to the comparison of design and production costs with other forms of instruction or the establishment of standards pertaining to budgeting for these costs."
549,1,"This study made use of a cross-case method among 3 case studies using mixed methods, including horizontal budget variance calculation and qualitative interpretation of responses from course designers for budget variance using total quality management themes. "
550,1,The different implementation-specific aspects of these cases were used to establish common principles in the composition of budgets in the production and delivery of an applied health professional e-Learning course.
551,2,"A total of 2 case studies reported significant negative budget variances caused by issues surrounding underreporting of personnel costs, inaccurate resource task estimation, lack of contingency planning, challenges in third-party resource management, and the need to update health-related materials that became outdated during course production. "
552,2,"The third study reported a positive budget variance because of the cost efficiency derived from previous implementation, the strong working relationship of the course project team, and the use of iterative project management methods."
553,3,This research suggests that the delivery costs of an e-Learning course could be underestimated or underreported and identifies factors that could be used to better control budgets. 
554,3,"Through consistent management of factors affecting the cost of course production, further research could be undertaken using standard economic evaluation methods to evaluate the advantages of using e-Learning."
555,4,Older Adults Perspectives on Using Digital Technology to Maintain Good Mental Health: Interactive Group Study
556,0,A growing number of apps to support good mental health and well-being are available on digital platforms. 
557,0,"However, very few studies have examined older adults' attitudes toward the use of these apps, despite increasing uptake of digital technologies by this demographic."
558,1,"A total of 15 older adults aged 50 years or older, in two groups, participated in sessions to explore the use of digital technologies to support mental health. "
559,1,Interactive activities were designed to capture participants' immediate reactions to apps and websites designed to support mental health and to explore their experiences of using technology for these purposes in their own lives. 
560,1,Template analysis was used to analyze transcripts of the group discussions.
561,2,"Older adults were motivated to turn to technology to improve mood through mechanisms of distraction, normalization, and facilitated expression of mental states, while aiming to reduce burden on others. "
562,2,"Perceived barriers to use included fear of consequences and the impact of low mood on readiness to engage with technology, as well as a lack of prior knowledge applicable to digital technologies. "
563,2,"Participants were aware of websites available to support mental health, but awareness alone did not motivate use."
564,3,"Older adults are motivated to use digital technologies to improve their mental health, but barriers remain that developers need to address for this population to access them."
565,4,A Web-Based Application to Improve Data Collection in an Interventional Study Targeting Childhood Obesity: Pre-Post Analysis
566,0,"Although participatory action research (PAR) studies have proliferated in recent years, the development of technological resources to manage these types of projects has not kept pace. "
567,0,Few studies show how Web-based applications can be used to efficiently manage the data collection process.
568,1,We described the transformation of the data management process and evaluated the impact of the application in terms of time efficiency of data collection and engagement of community-based data collectors. 
569,1,"We defined time efficiency as the total number of days it took to collect 3 main surveys, per year of data collection. "
570,1,The engagement of data collectors was assessed based on qualitative reports.
571,2,The amount of time it took to perform a round of data collection was reduced after implementation of the field team application (between 382 and 383 days and 198 and 233 days). 
572,2,"Secondary data were also collected in a tighter time frame around collection of the primary outcome, and communication among data collectors, the field staff, and the research team was streamlined. "
573,2,"In focus groups, community-based data collectors reported feeling more empowered and engaged in the data collection process after implementation of the application."
574,3,A Web-based management application was successful in improving data collection time efficiency and engagement among data collectors.
575,4,Decision Support Tools for Regenerative Medicine: Systematic Review
576,0,Decisional tools have demonstrated their importance in informing manufacturing and commercial decisions in the monoclonal antibody domain. 
577,0,Recent approved therapies in regenerative medicine have shown great clinical benefits to patients.
578,1,"We systematically searched MEDLINE to identify articles on decision support tools relevant to tissue engineering, and cell and gene therapy, with the aim of identifying gaps for future decisional tool development. "
579,1,We included published studies in English including a description of decisional tools in regenerative medicines. 
580,1,We extracted data using a predesigned Excel table and assessed the data both quantitatively and qualitatively.
581,2,We identified 9 articles addressing key decisions in manufacturing and product development challenges in cell therapies. 
582,2,"The decision objectives, parameters, assumptions, and solution methods were analyzed in detail. "
583,2,"We found that all decisional tools focused on cell therapies, and 6 of the 9 reviews focused on allogeneic cell therapy products. "
584,2,We identified no available tools on tissue-engineering and gene therapy products. 
585,2,"These studies addressed key decisions in manufacturing and product development challenges in cell therapies, such as choice of technology, through modeling."
586,3,Our review identified a limited number of decisional tools. 
587,3,"While the monoclonal antibodies and biologics decisional tool domain has been well developed and has shown great importance in driving more cost-effective manufacturing processes and better investment decisions, there is a lot to be learned in the regenerative medicine domain. "
588,3,"There is ample space for expansion, especially with regard to autologous cell therapies, tissue engineering, and gene therapies. "
589,3,"To consider the problem more comprehensively, the full needle-to-needle process should be modeled and evaluated."
590,4,The Use of Social Networking Sites in Mental Health Interventions for Young People: Systematic Review
591,0,"The onset of mental health problems peaks between adolescence and young adulthood; however, young people face barriers to treatment and are often reluctant to seek professional help. "
592,0,"Many are instead seeking support and information regarding their mental health via the Web, especially via social networking sites (SNSs), and hence, there is a promising opportunity to use SNSs to deliver or integrate with youth-focused online mental health interventions. "
593,0,"Previous reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of SNSs for specific disorders in young people; however, none of the reviews have covered the breadth of SNS-based youth mental health interventions available across all mental health issues."
594,1,The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched using Medical Subject Headings terms and exploded keywords and phrases. 
595,1,"Retrieved abstracts (n= 974) were double screened, yielding 235 articles for screening at the full-text level. "
596,1,"Of these, 9 articles met the review inclusion criteria. "
597,1,"Given the small number of studies, and the variety of outcome measures used, a quantitative meta-analysis was not possible."
598,2,"The 9 articles (quantitative studies, qualitative studies, and descriptions of the iterative design process) covered 5 separate interventions. "
599,2,"Of the 5 interventions, 2 interventions used purpose-built platforms based on the moderated online social therapy (MOST) model, 2 used Facebook, and 1 evaluated a purpose-built mobile app. "
600,2,"The 2 MOST interventions targeted specific mental health issues (depression and psychosis), whereas the others focused on improving mental health literacy, social support, and general well-being. "
601,2,"Only 3 quantitative studies were identified, and all used a pre-post design (without a control group) to establish proof of concept. "
602,2,"Of the outcome variables assessed, there were significant improvements in mental health knowledge and number of depressive symptoms but no improvement in anxiety or psychosis symptoms. "
603,2,"Acceptability of and engagement with the SNS platforms were generally high, as were perceptions of usefulness and safety. "
604,2,Moderation by clinical experts was identified as a key component of the more successful interventions. 
605,2,"When offered a choice, users showed a preference for mobile apps over Web-based interfaces."
606,3,"The evidence reviewed suggests young people find SNS-based interventions highly usable, engaging, and supportive. "
607,3,"However, future studies need to address the current lack of high-quality evidence for their efficacy in reducing mental health symptoms. "
608,3,"Given young people are already turning to SNSs to engage in knowledge seeking and peer-to-peer support, SNS-based youth mental health interventions provide an opportunity to address some of the barriers young people face in accessing qualified mental health support and information."
609,4,Theory-Based Digital Interventions to Improve Asthma Self-Management Outcomes: Systematic Review
610,0,Asthma is a chronic disease requiring effective self-management to control it and prevent mortality. 
611,0,The use of theory-informed digital interventions promoting asthma self-management is increasing. 
612,0,"However, there is limited knowledge concerning how and to what extent psychological theory has been applied to the development of digital interventions, or how using theory impacts outcomes."
613,1,"Electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) were searched systematically using predetermined terms. "
614,1,Additional studies were identified by scanning references within relevant studies. 
615,1,Two researchers screened titles and abstracts against predefined inclusion criteria; a third resolved discrepancies. 
616,1,Full-text review was undertaken for relevant studies. 
617,1,Those meeting inclusion criteria were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. 
618,1,The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. 
619,1,"Study outcomes were classified as medication adherence, self-management, asthma control, clinical markers of health, quality of life, other quality of life outcomes, and health care utilization. "
620,1,Effectiveness was calculated as an average outcome score based on the study's reported significance. 
621,1,The Theory Coding Scheme (TCS) was used to establish the extent to which each intervention had applied theory and which theoretical constructs or behavioral determinants were addressed. 
622,1,Associations between TCS scores and asthma outcomes were described within a narrative synthesis.
623,2,Fourteen studies evaluating 14 different digital interventions were included in this review. 
624,2,"The most commonly cited theories were Social Cognitive Theory, Health Belief Model, and Self-Efficacy Theory. "
625,2,A greater use of theory in the development of interventions was correlated with effective outcomes (r=.657; P=.01): only the 3 studies that met <= 60% of the different uses of theory assessed by the TCS were effective on all behavioral and clinical outcomes measured. 
626,2,"None of the 11 studies that met = 60% of the TCS criteria were fully effective; however, 3 interventions were partially effective (ie, the intervention had a significant impact on some, but not all, of the outcomes measured). "
627,2,Most studies lacked detail on the theoretical constructs and how they were applied to the development and application of the intervention.
628,3,These findings suggest that greater use of theory in the development and application of digital self-management interventions for asthma may increase their effectiveness. 
629,3,"The application of theory alone may not be enough to yield a successful intervention, and other factors (eg, the context in which the intervention is used) should be considered. "
630,3,"A systematic approach to the use of theory to guide the design, selection, and application of intervention techniques is needed."
631,4,Skin Cancer Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks: Systematic Review
632,0,"State-of-the-art classifiers based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were shown to classify images of skin cancer on par with dermatologists and could enable lifesaving and fast diagnoses, even outside the hospital via installation of apps on mobile devices. "
633,0,"To our knowledge, at present there is no review of the current work in this research area."
634,1,"We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases for systematic reviews and original research articles published in English. "
635,1,Only papers that reported sufficient scientific proceedings are included in this review.
636,2,We found 13 papers that classified skin lesions using CNNs. 
637,2,"In principle, classification methods can be differentiated according to three principles. "
638,2,Approaches that use a CNN already trained by means of another large dataset and then optimize its parameters to the classification of skin lesions are the most common ones used and they display the best performance with the currently available limited datasets.
639,3,CNNs display a high performance as state-of-the-art skin lesion classifiers. 
640,3,"Unfortunately, it is difficult to compare different classification methods because some approaches use nonpublic datasets for training and/or testing, thereby making reproducibility difficult. "
641,3,Future publications should use publicly available benchmarks and fully disclose methods used for training to allow comparability.
642,4,"A Web-Based Acceptance-Facilitating Intervention for Identifying Patients Acceptance, Uptake, and Adherence of Internet- and Mobile-Based Pain Interventions: Randomized Controlled Trial"
643,0,Internet- and mobile-based interventions are effective for the treatment of chronic pain. 
644,0,"However, little is known about patients' willingness to engage with these types of interventions and how the uptake of such interventions can be improved."
645,1,"In this randomized controlled trial with a parallel design, we invited 489 individuals with chronic pain to participate in a Web-based survey assessing the acceptance of internet- and mobile-based interventions with the offer to receive an unguided internet- and mobile-based intervention for chronic pain after completion. "
646,1,Two versions of the Web-based survey (with and without AFI) were randomly sent to two groups: one with AFI (n= 245) and one without AFI (n= 244). 
647,1,"Participants who completed the Web-based survey with or without AFI entered the intervention group or the control group, respectively. "
648,1,"In the survey, the individuals' acceptance of pain interventions, measured with a 4-item scale (sum score ranging from 4 to 20), predictors of acceptance, sociodemographic and pain-related variables, and physical and emotional functioning were assessed. "
649,1,Uptake rates (log in to the intervention) and adherence (number of completed modules) to the intervention was assessed 4 months after intervention access. 
650,1,"To examine which factors influence acceptance, uptake rate, and adherence in the internet- and mobile-based interventions, we conducted additional exploratory subgroup analyses."
651,2,"In total, 57 (intervention group) and 58 (control group) participants in each group completed the survey and were included in the analyses. "
652,2,"The groups did not differ with regard to acceptance, uptake rate, or adherence (P=.64, P=.56, P=.75, respectively). "
653,2,"Most participants reported moderate (68/115, 59.1%) to high (36/115, 31.3%) acceptance, with 9.6% (11/115) showing low acceptance (intervention group: mean 13.91, SD 3.47; control group: mean 13.61, SD 3.50). "
654,2,"Further, 67% (38/57, intervention group) and 62% (36/58, control group) had logged into the intervention. "
655,2,"In both groups, an average of 1.04 (SD 1.51) and 1.14 (SD 1.90) modules were completed, respectively."
656,3,"The informational video was not effective with regard to acceptance, uptake rate, or adherence. "
657,3,"Despite the high acceptance, the uptake rate was only moderate and adherence was remarkably low. "
658,3,This study shows that acceptance can be much higher in a sample participating in an internet- and mobile-based intervention efficacy trial than in the target population in routine health care settings. 
659,3,"Thus, future research should focus not only on acceptance and uptake facilitating interventions but also on ways to influence adherence. "
660,3,Further research should be conducted within routine health care settings with more representative samples of the target population.
661,4,Relationship Between Internet Health Information and Patient Compliance Based on Trust: Empirical Study
662,0,"The internet has become a major mean for acquiring health information; however, Web-based health information is of mixed quality and may markedly affect patients' health-related behavior and decisions. "
663,0,"According to the social information processing theory, patients' trust in their physicians may potentially change due to patients' health-information-seeking behavior. "
664,0,"Therefore, it is important to identify the relationship between internet health information and patient compliance from the perspective of trust."
665,1,A Web-based survey involving 336 valid participants was conducted in China. 
666,1,"The study included independent variables (internet health information quality and source of information), 2 mediators (cognition-based trust [CBT] and affect-based trust [ABT]), 1 dependent variable (patient compliance), and 3 control variables (gender, age, and job). "
667,1,"All variables were measured using multiple-item scales from previously validated instruments, and confirmative factor analysis as well as structural equation modeling was used to test hypotheses."
668,2,"The questionnaire response rate was 77.16% (375/486), validity rate was 89.6% (336/375), and reliability and validity were acceptable. "
669,2,We found that the quality and source of internet health information affect patient compliance through the mediation of CBT and ABT. 
670,2,"In addition, internet health information quality has a stronger influence on patient compliance than the source of information. "
671,2,"However, CBT does not have any direct effect on patient compliance, but it directly affects ABT and then indirectly impacts patient compliance. "
672,2,"Therefore, the effect of ABT seems stronger than that of CBT. "
673,2,"We found an unexpected, nonsignificant relationship between the source of internet health information and ABT."
674,3,"From patients' perspective, internet health information quality plays a stronger role than its source in impacting their trust in physicians and the consequent compliance with physicians. "
675,3,"Therefore, patient compliance can be improved by strengthening the management of internet health information quality. "
676,3,"The study findings also suggest that physicians should focus on obtaining health information from health websites, thereby expanding their understanding of patients' Web-based health-information-seeking preferences, and enriching their knowledge structure to show their specialization and reliability in the communication with patients. "
677,3,"In addition, the mutual demonstration of care and respect in the communication between physicians and patients is important in promoting patients' ABT in their physicians."
678,4,"Self-Harm, Suicidal Behaviours, and Cyberbullying in Children and Young People: Systematic Review"
679,0,"Given the concerns about bullying via electronic communication in children and young people and its possible contribution to self-harm, we have reviewed the evidence for associations between cyberbullying involvement and self-harm or suicidal behaviors (such as suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts) in children and young people."
680,1,"An electronic literature search was conducted for all studies published between January 1, 1996, and February 3, 2017, across sources, including MEDLINE, Cochrane, and PsycINFO. "
681,1,Articles were included if the study examined any association between cyberbullying involvement and self-harm or suicidal behaviors and reported empirical data in a sample aged under 25 years. 
682,1,Quality of included papers was assessed and data were extracted. 
683,1,Meta-analyses of data were conducted.
684,2,"A total of 33 eligible articles from 26 independent studies were included, covering a population of 156,384 children and young people. "
685,2,"A total of 25 articles (20 independent studies, n=115,056) identified associations (negative influences) between cybervictimization and self-harm or suicidal behaviors or between perpetrating cyberbullying and suicidal behaviors. "
686,2,"Three additional studies, in which the cyberbullying, self-harm, or suicidal behaviors measures had been combined with other measures (such as traditional bullying and mental health problems), also showed negative influences (n=44,526). "
687,2,A total of 5 studies showed no significant associations (n=5646). 
688,2,"Meta-analyses, producing odds ratios (ORs) as a summary measure of effect size (eg, ratio of the odds of cyber victims who have experienced SH vs nonvictims who have experienced SH), showed that, compared with nonvictims, those who have experienced cybervictimization were OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.65-3.34) times as likely to self-harm, OR 2.10 (95% CI 1.73-2.55) times as likely to exhibit suicidal behaviors, OR 2.57 (95% CI 1.69-3.90) times more likely to attempt suicide, and OR 2.15 (95% CI 1.70-2.71) times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. "
689,2,Cyberbullying perpetrators were OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.02-1.44) times more likely to exhibit suicidal behaviors and OR 1.23 (95% CI 1.10-1.37) times more likely to experience suicidal ideation than nonperpetrators.
690,3,Victims of cyberbullying are at a greater risk than nonvictims of both self-harm and suicidal behaviors. 
691,3,"To a lesser extent, perpetrators of cyberbullying are at risk of suicidal behaviors and suicidal ideation when compared with nonperpetrators. "
692,3,Policy makers and schools should prioritize the inclusion of cyberbullying involvement in programs to prevent traditional bullying. 
693,3,"Type of cyberbullying involvement, frequency, and gender should be assessed in future studies."
694,4,Use of Smartphones for Early Detection of Melanoma: Systematic Review
695,0,The early diagnosis of melanoma is associated with decreased mortality. 
696,0,"The smartphone, with its apps and the possibility of sending photographs to a dermatologist, could improve the early diagnosis of melanoma."
697,1,"We conducted a systematic search of PubMed for the period from January 1, 2007 (launch of the first smartphone) to November 1, 2017."
698,2,"The results of the 25 studies included 13 concentrated on store-and-forward teledermatology, and 12 analyzed automated smartphone apps. "
699,2,"Store-and-forward teledermatology opens several new perspectives, such as it accelerates the care course (less than 10 days vs 80 days), and the related procedures were assessed in primary care populations. "
700,2,"However, the concordance between the conclusion of a teledermatologist and the conclusion of a dermatologist who conducts a face-to-face examination depended on the study (the kappa coefficient range was .20 to .84, median kappa=. 60). "
701,2,"The use of a dermoscope may improve the concordance (the kappa coefficient range was .29 to .87, median kappa=. 74). "
702,2,"Regarding automated smartphone apps, the major concerns are the lack of assessment in clinical practice conditions, the lack of assessment in primary care populations, and their low sensitivity, ranging from 7% to 87% (median 69%). "
703,2,"In this literature review, up to 20% of the photographs transmitted were of insufficient quality. "
704,2,The modalities of picture taking and encryption of the data were only partially reported.
705,3,The use of store-and-forward teledermatology could improve access to a dermatology consultation by optimizing the care course. 
706,3,Our review confirmed the absence of evidence of the safety and efficacy of automated smartphone medical apps. 
707,3,"Further research is required to determine quality criteria, as there was major variability among the studies."
708,4,Self-Swabbing for Virological Confirmation of Influenza-Like Illness Among an Internet-Based Cohort in the UK During the 2014-2015 Flu Season: Pilot Study
709,0,"Routine influenza surveillance, based on laboratory confirmation of viral infection, often fails to estimate the true burden of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community because those with ILI often manage their own symptoms without visiting a health professional. "
710,0,Internet-based surveillance can complement this traditional surveillance by measuring symptoms and health behavior of a population with minimal time delay. 
711,0,"Flusurvey, the UK's largest crowd-sourced platform for surveillance of influenza, collects routine data on more than 6000 voluntary participants and offers real-time estimates of ILI circulation. "
712,0,"However, one criticism of this method of surveillance is that it is only able to assess ILI, rather than virologically confirmed influenza."
713,1,"Virological swabbing kits were sent to pilot study participants, who then monitored their ILI symptoms over the influenza season (2014-2015) through the Flusurvey platform. "
714,1,"If they reported ILI, they were asked to undertake self-swabbing and return the swabs to a Public Health England laboratory for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction testing."
715,2,"A total of 700 swab kits were distributed at the start of the study; from these, 66 participants met the definition for ILI and were asked to return samples. "
716,2,"In all, 51 samples were received in the laboratory, 18 of which tested positive for a viral cause of ILI (35%)."
717,3,This demonstrated proof of concept that it is possible to apply self-swabbing for virological laboratory testing to an online cohort study. 
718,3,"This pilot does not have significant numbers to validate whether Flusurvey surveillance accurately reflects influenza infection in the community, but highlights that the methodology is feasible. "
719,3,"Self-swabbing could be expanded to larger online surveillance activities, such as during the initial stages of a pandemic, to understand community transmission or to better assess interseasonal activity."
720,4,Health-Seeking Influence Reflected by Online Health-Related Messages Received on Social Media: Cross-Sectional Survey
721,0,"Major social networking platforms, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter, have become popular means through which people share health-related information, irrespective of whether messages disseminated through these channels are authentic."
722,1,"We conducted a cross-sectional survey between April and June 2015 on patients attending outpatient clinics at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. "
723,1,"Patients who used social media (Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter) were included. "
724,1,We designed a questionnaire with closed-ended and multiple-choice questions to assess the type of social media platforms patients used and whether information received on these platforms influenced their health care decisions. 
725,1,We used chi-square test to establish the relationship between categorical variables.
726,2,"Of the 442 patients who filled in the questionnaires, 401 used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Twitter. "
727,2,"The majority of respondents (89.8%, 397/442) used WhatsApp, followed by Facebook (58.6%, 259/442) and Twitter (42.3%, 187/442). "
728,2,"In most cases, respondents received health-related messages from WhatsApp and approximately 42.6% (171/401) reported ever stopping treatment as advised on a social media platform. "
729,2,A significantly higher proportion of patients without heart disease (P=.001) and obese persons (P=.01) checked the authenticity of information received on social media. 
730,2,Social media messages influenced decision making among patients without heart disease (P=.04). 
731,2,Respondents without heart disease (P=.001) and obese persons (P=.01) were more likely to discuss health-related information received on social media channels with a health care professional. 
732,2,A significant proportion of WhatsApp users reported that health-related information received on this platform influenced decisions regarding their family's health care (P=.001). 
733,2,Respondents' decisions regarding family health care were more likely to be influenced when they used two or all three types of platforms (P=.003).
734,3,"Health education in the digital era needs to be accurate, evidence-based, and regulated. "
735,3,"As technologies continue to evolve, we must be equipped to face the challenges it brings with it."
736,4,Consumer Health-Related Activities on Social Media: Exploratory Study
737,0,"Although a number of studies have investigated how consumers use social media for health-related purposes, there is a paucity of studies in the Australian context."
738,1,"A total of 5 focus groups (n=36 participants), each lasting 60 to 90 minutes, were conducted in the Sydney metropolitan area. "
739,1,The group discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. 
740,1,The transcripts were coded line-by-line and thematically analyzed.
741,2,Participants used general search engines to locate health-related social media platforms. 
742,2,"They accessed a wide range of social media on a daily basis, using several electronic devices (in particular, mobile phones). "
743,2,"Although privacy was a concern, it did not prevent consumers from fully engaging in social media for health-related purposes. "
744,2,Blogs were used to learn from other people's experiences with the same condition. 
745,2,Facebook allowed consumers to follow health-related pages and to participate in disease-specific group discussions. 
746,2,Wikipedia was used for factual information about diseases and treatments. 
747,2,YouTube was accessed to learn about medical procedures such as surgery. 
748,2,No participant reported editing or contributing to Wikipedia or posting YouTube videos related to health topics. 
749,2,Twitter was rarely used for health-related purposes. 
750,2,Social media allowed consumers to obtain and provide disease and treatment-related information and social and emotional support for those living with the same condition. 
751,2,"Most considered their participation as observational, but some also contributed (eg, responded to people's questions)."
752,3,Participants used a wide range of social media for health-related purposes. 
753,3,"Medical information exchange (eg, disease and treatment) and social and emotional support were the cornerstones of their online activities. "
754,3,Social media appears to be used as a key tool to support disease self-management.
755,4,Social Media-Promoted Weight Loss Among an Occupational Population: Cohort Study Using a WeChat Mobile Phone App-Based Campaign
756,0,Being overweight and obese are major risk factors for noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases. 
757,0,The prevalence of overweight and obesity is high throughout the world and these issues are very serious in the Shunyi District in China. 
758,0,"As mobile technologies have rapidly developed, mobile apps such as WeChat are well accepted and have the potential to improve health behaviors."
759,1,This study was conducted among an occupational population from August 2015 to February 2016 in the Shunyi District of Beijing. 
760,1,"Before the intervention, the Shunyi District Government released an official document for weight loss to all 134 government agencies and enterprises in Shunyi District. "
761,1,Participants willing to use our official WeChat account were enrolled in a WeChat group and received 6 months of interventions for weight loss; those who were not willing to use the account were in a control group given routine publicity on weight loss.
762,2,"In total, 15,310 occupational participants including 3467 participants (22.65%) in the control group and 11,843 participants (77.35%) in the WeChat group were enrolled. "
763,2,"Participants in the WeChat group lost more weight (mean 2.09, SD 3.43 kg) than people in the control group (mean 1.78, SD 2.96 kg), and the difference in mean weight loss between the two groups for males was significant based on the stratification of age and educational level. "
764,2,"To control for confounding factors and to explore the effects of WeChat on weight loss, the propensity score method with a multinominal logistic regression was utilized. "
765,2,"For males, this showed that the WeChat group (with both active and inactive subgroups) had a higher probability of maintaining weight, weight loss from 1 to 2 kg, or weight loss more than 2 kg than the control group. "
766,2,"However, the control group had higher probability of weight loss from 0 to 1 kg. "
767,2,Being active in WeChat was likely to be associated with weight loss. 
768,2,"The more active participants were in the weight loss program via WeChat, the more weight they lost."
769,3,The weight loss intervention campaign based on an official WeChat account focused on an occupation-based population in Shunyi District was effective for males. 
770,3,"The more active male participants were in using WeChat, the more weight they lost. "
771,3,There might be no effect or there may even be a negative effect on weight loss for females. 
772,3,"Future research should focus on how to improve adherence to the WeChat weight loss interventions, to improve and refine the WeChat content such as developing a variety of materials to attract interest, and to protect personal privacy, especially for females."
773,4,III Literates or IIliterates? Investigating the eHealth Literacy of Users of Online Health Communities
774,0,"Electronic health (eHealth) literacy is an important skill that allows patients to navigate intelligibly through the vast, often misleading Web-based world. "
775,0,"Although eHealth literacy has been investigated in general and specific demographic populations, it has not yet been analyzed on users of online health communities (OHCs). "
776,0,"Evidence shows that OHCs are important Web 2.0 applications for patients for managing their health, but at the same time, warnings have been expressed regarding the quality and relevance of shared information. "
777,0,No studies exist that investigate levels of eHealth literacy among users of OHCs and differences in eHealth literacy between different types of users.
778,1,"The study was based on a cross-sectional Web survey on a simple random sample of 15,000 registered users of the most popular general OHC in Slovenia. "
779,1,The final sample comprised 644 users of the studied OHC. 
780,1,"An extended eHEALS (eHEALS-E) was tested with factor analytical procedures, whereas user types were identified with a hierarchical clustering algorithm. "
781,1,The research question was analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure and pairwise comparison tests.
782,2,"Factor analysis of the revised and extended eHEALS revealed six dimensions: awareness of sources, recognizing quality and meaning, understanding information, perceived efficiency, validating information, and being smart on the Net. "
783,2,The factor solution demonstrates a good fit to the data (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=.059). 
784,2,"The most developed dimension of eHEALS-E is awareness of different Internet sources (mean=3.98, standard deviation [SD]=0.61), whereas the least developed is understanding information (mean=3.11, SD=0.75). "
785,2,"Clustering resulted in four user types: active help-seekers (48.3%, 311/644), lurkers (31.8%, 205/644), core relational users (16.9%, 109/644), and low-engaged users (3%, 19/644). "
786,2,Analysis of the research question showed statistically significant differences among user types across all six dimensions of eHEALS-E. 
787,2,"Most notably, core relational users performed worse than lurkers on the validating information dimension (P=.01) and worse than active help-seekers on the being smart on the Net dimension (P=.05). "
788,2,"Active help-seekers have the highest scores in all dimensions of the eHEALS-E, whereas low-engaged users have statistically significantly lower scores on all dimensions of the eHEALS-E in comparison with the other groups."
789,3,Those who are looking for advice and support in OHCs by making queries are well equipped with eHealth literacy skills to filter potential misinformation and detect bad advice. 
790,3,"However, core relational users (who produce the most content in OHCs) have less-developed skills for cross-validating the information obtained and navigating successfully through the perils of the online world. "
791,3,Site managers should monitor their activity to avoid the spread of misinformation that might lead to unhealthy practices.
792,4,Identifying Potential Norovirus Epidemics in China via Internet Surveillance
793,0,"Norovirus is a common virus that causes acute gastroenteritis worldwide, but a monitoring system for norovirus is unavailable in China."
794,1,"The norovirus-related data of a selected outbreak in Jiaxing Municipality, Zhejiang Province of China, in 2014 were collected from immediate epidemiological investigation, and the Internet search volume, as indicated by the Baidu Index, was acquired from the Baidu search engine. "
795,1,"All correlated search keywords in relation to norovirus were captured, screened, and composited to establish the composite Baidu Index at different time lags by Spearman rank correlation. "
796,1,The optimal model was chosen and possibly predicted maps in Zhejiang Province were presented by ArcGIS software.
797,2,"The combination of two vital keywords at a time lag of 1 day was ultimately identified as optimal (rho =.924, P<.001). "
798,2,"The exponential curve model was constructed to fit the trend of this epidemic, suggesting that a one-unit increase in the mean composite Baidu Index contributed to an increase of norovirus infections by 2.15 times during the outbreak. "
799,2,"In addition to Jiaxing Municipality, Hangzhou Municipality might have had some potential epidemics in the study time from the predicted model."
800,3,"Although there are limitations with early warning and unavoidable biases, Internet surveillance may be still useful for the monitoring of norovirus epidemics when a monitoring system is unavailable."
801,4,Accelerating Digital Mental Health Research From Early Design and Creation to Successful Implementation and Sustainment
802,0,"Mental health problems are commonly encountered in primary care, with primary care providers (PCPs) experiencing challenges referring patients to specialty mental health care. "
803,0,Electronic consultation (eConsult) is one model that has been shown to improve timely access to subspecialty care in a number of medical subspecialties. 
804,0,eConsults generally involve a PCP-initiated referral for specialty consultation for a clinical question that is outside their expertise but may not require an in-person evaluation.
805,1,We performed a content analysis of the first 50 eConsults to psychiatry after program implementation. 
806,1,"For each question and response, we coded consults as pertaining to diagnosis and/or management as well as categories of medication choice, drug side effects or interactions, and queries about referrals and navigating the health care system. "
807,1,We also performed a chart review to evaluate the timeliness of psychiatrist responses and PCP implementation of recommendations.
808,2,"Depression was the most common consult template selected by PCPs (20/50, 40%), followed by the generic template (12/50, 24%) and anxiety (8/50, 16%). "
809,2,"Most questions (49/50, 98%) pertained primarily to management, particularly for medications. "
810,2,"Psychiatrists commented on both diagnosis (28/50, 56%) and management (50/50, 100%), responded in an average of 1.4 days, and recommended in-person consultation for 26% (13/50) of patients. "
811,2,PCPs implemented psychiatrist recommendations 76% (38/50) of the time.
812,3,"For the majority of patients, psychiatrists provided strategies for ongoing management in primary care without an in-person evaluation, and PCPs implemented most psychiatrist recommendations. "
813,3,eConsults show promise as one means of supporting PCPs to deliver mental health care to patients with common psychiatric disorders.
814,4,Adolescents Perspectives on Personalized E-Feedback in the Context of Health Risk Behavior Screening for Primary Care: Qualitative Study
815,0,Electronic health screening tools for primary care present an opportunity to go beyond data collection to provide education and feedback to adolescents in order to motivate behavior change. 
816,0,"However, there is limited research to guide feedback message development."
817,1,"In total, 31 adolescents aged 13-18 years completed the screening tool, received the electronic feedback, and subsequently participated in individual, semistructured, qualitative interviews lasting approximately 60 min. "
818,1,"Participants were queried about their overall impressions of the tool, perceptions regarding various types of feedback messages, and additional features that would help motivate health behavior change. "
819,1,"Using thematic analysis, interview transcripts were coded to identify common themes expressed across participants."
820,2,"Overall, the tool was well-received by participants who perceived it as a way to enhance-but not replace-their interactions with providers. "
821,2,"They appreciated receiving nonjudgmental feedback from the tool and responded positively to information regarding the consequences of behaviors, comparisons with peer norms and health guidelines, tips for behavior change, and reinforcement of healthy choices. "
822,2,A small but noteworthy minority of participants dismissed the peer norms as not real or relevant and national guidelines as not valid or reasonable. 
823,2,"When prompted for possible adaptations to the tool, adolescents expressed interest in receiving follow-up information, setting health-related goals, tracking their behaviors over time, and communicating with providers electronically between appointments."
824,3,"Adolescents in this qualitative study desired feedback that validates their healthy behavior choices and supports them as independent decision makers by neutrally presenting health information, facilitating goal setting, and offering ongoing technological supports."
825,4,Interactive Voice Response System: Data Considerations and Lessons Learned During a Rectal Microbicide Placebo Adherence Trial for Young Men Who Have Sex With Men
826,0,"Rectal microbicides, if proven effective, may aid in reducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence; however, demonstration of efficacy and effectiveness is contingent on accurate measurement of product adherence. "
827,0,"Delays in self-report, in particular, may affect the accuracy of behavioral data."
828,1,"YMSM (N=95) enrolled across 3 sites (Boston, Pittsburgh, and San Juan) were asked to report their use of an applicator applied placebo rectal gel product during receptive anal intercourse (RAI) using the IVRS. "
829,1,IVRS was available in Spanish and English. 
830,1,"After the 12-week trial, we examined whether IVRS problems were associated with YMSM's sociodemographic characteristics (eg, age, race and ethnicity, and education), sexual behavior, or recruitment site. "
831,1,We used a multinomial logistic regression to compare YMSM who experienced no IVRS problems (n=40) with those who reported one IVRS problem (n=25) or two or more IVRS problems (n=30).
832,2,We recorded 1494 IVRS calls over 12 weeks. 
833,2,Over half of the participants (55/95; 58%) experienced challenges using the IVRS during the 12-week trial. 
834,2,"YMSM reporting greater RAI occasions during the trial were more likely to experience one (odds ratio [ OR]=1.08, 95% CI (1.02-1.14); P <=.01) or more (OR=1.10, 95% CI (1.03-1.16); P <=.001) IVRS challenges. "
835,2,"Greater educational attainment was associated with multiple IVRS challenges (OR=7.08, 95% CI (1.6-31.6); P <=.01). "
836,2,Participants in the Puerto Rico site were most likely to report multiple IVRS problems.
837,3,"Although IVRS was a useful data collection technology in our trial, several challenges experienced by English and Spanish speaking YMSM diminish its overall acceptability. "
838,3,We discuss strategies to optimize future development of IVRS data quality protocols based on lessons learned.
839,4,Tracing the Potential Flow of Consumer Data: A Network Analysis of Prominent Health and Fitness Apps
840,0,"A great deal of consumer data, collected actively through consumer reporting or passively through sensors, is shared among apps. "
841,0,"Developers increasingly allow their programs to communicate with other apps, sensors, and Web-based services, which are promoted as features to potential users. "
842,0,"However, health apps also routinely pose risks related to information leaks, information manipulation, and loss of information. "
843,0,"There has been less investigation into the kinds of user data that developers are likely to collect, and who might have access to it."
844,1,"We purposively sampled prominent health and fitness apps available in the United States, Canada, and Australia Google Play and iTunes app stores in November 2015. "
845,1,"Two independent coders extracted data from app promotional materials on app and developer characteristics, and the developer-reported collection and sharing of user data. "
846,1,"We conducted a descriptive analysis of app, developer, and user data collection characteristics. "
847,1,"Using structural equivalence analysis, we conducted a network analysis of sampled apps' self-reported sharing of user-generated data."
848,2,"We included 297 unique apps published by 231 individual developers, which requested 58 different permissions (mean 7.95, SD 6.57). "
849,2,We grouped apps into 222 app families on the basis of shared ownership. 
850,2,"Analysis of self-reported data sharing revealed a network of 359 app family nodes, with one connected central component of 210 app families (58.5%). "
851,2,"Most (143/222, 64.4%) of the sampled app families did not report sharing any data and were therefore isolated from each other and from the core network. "
852,2,Fifteen app families assumed more central network positions as gatekeepers on the shortest paths that data would have to travel between other app families.
853,3,This cross-sectional analysis highlights the possibilities for user data collection and potential paths that data is able to travel among a sample of prominent health and fitness apps. 
854,3,"While individual apps may not collect personally identifiable information, app families and the partners with which they share data may be able to aggregate consumer data, thus achieving a much more comprehensive picture of the individual consumer. "
855,3,"The organizations behind the centrally connected app families represent diverse industries, including apparel manufacturers and social media platforms that are not traditionally involved in health or fitness. "
856,3,"This analysis highlights the potential for anticipated and voluntary but also possibly unanticipated and involuntary sharing of user data, validating privacy and security concerns in mobile health."
857,4,"Identifying and Understanding the Health Information Experiences and Preferences of Caregivers of Individuals With Either Traumatic Brain Injury, Spinal Cord Injury, or Burn Injury: A Qualitative Investigation"
858,0,"In order to meet the challenges of caring for an injured person, caregivers need access to health information. "
859,0,"However, caregivers often feel that they lack adequate information. "
860,0,"Previous studies of caregivers have primarily focused on either their time and emotional burdens or their health outcomes, but the information needs of caregivers have not been thoroughly investigated."
861,1,"A total of 32 caregivers participated in semistructured interviews, which were used in order to develop a more in-depth understanding of these caregivers' information needs. "
862,1,Digital audio recordings of the interviews were used for analysis purposes. 
863,1,These audio recordings were analyzed using a thematic analysis or qualitative content analysis. 
864,1,"All of participant's interviews were then coded using the qualitative analysis program, Nvivo 10 for Mac (QSR International)."
865,2,The caregivers endorsed similar behaviors and preferences when seeking and accessing health information. 
866,2,"Medical professionals were the preferred source of information, while ease of access made the Internet the most common avenue to obtain information. "
867,2,The challenges faced by participants were frequently a result of limited support. 
868,2,"In describing an ideal health system, participants expressed interest in a comprehensive care website offering support network resources, instructive services about the injury and caregiving, and injury-specific materials."
869,3,"According to the participants, an ideal health information system would include a comprehensive care website that offered supportive network resources, instructive services about the injury and caregiving, and materials specific of patient injury."
870,4,The Benefit of Web- and Computer-Based Interventions for Stress: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
871,0,Stress has been identified as one of the major public health issues in this century. 
872,0,New technologies offer opportunities to provide effective psychological interventions on a large scale.
873,1,"A meta-analysis was performed, including 26 comparisons (n=4226). "
874,1,Cohen d was calculated for the primary outcome level of stress to determine the difference between the intervention and control groups at posttest. 
875,1,"Analyses of the effect on depression, anxiety, and stress in the following subgroups were also conducted: risk of bias, theoretical basis, guidance, and length of the intervention. "
876,1,"Available follow-up data (1-3 months, 4-6 months) were assessed for the primary outcome stress."
877,2,The overall mean effect size for stress at posttest was Cohen d=0.43 (95% CI 0.31-0.54). 
878,2,"Significant, small effects were found for depression (Cohen d=0.34, 95% CI 0.21-0.48) and anxiety (Cohen d=0.32, 95% CI 0.17-0.47). "
879,2,"Subgroup analyses revealed that guided interventions (Cohen d=0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.79) were more effective than unguided interventions (Cohen d=0.33, 95% CI 0.20-0.46; P=.002). "
880,2,"With regard to the length of the intervention, short interventions (<= 4 weeks) showed a small effect size (Cohen d=0.33, 95% CI 0.22-0.44) and medium-long interventions (5-8 weeks) were moderately effective (Cohen d=0.59; 95% CI 0.45-0.74), whereas long interventions (>= 9 weeks) produced a nonsignificant effect (Cohen d=0.21, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.47; P=.006). "
881,2,"In terms of treatment type, interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and third-wave CBT (TWC) showed small-to-moderate effect sizes (CBT: Cohen d=0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.61; TWC: Cohen d=0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.71), and alternative interventions produced a small effect size (Cohen d=0.24, 95% CI 0.12-0.36; P=.03). "
882,2,Early evidence on follow-up data indicates that Web- and computer-based stress-management interventions can sustain their effects in terms of stress reduction in a small-to-moderate range up to 6 months.
883,3,These results provide evidence that Web- and computer-based stress-management interventions can be effective and have the potential to reduce stress-related mental health problems on a large scale.
884,4,Happiness Inventors: Informing Positive Computing Technologies Through Participatory Design With Children
885,0,Positive psychological interventions for children have typically focused on direct adaptations of interventions developed for adults. 
886,0,"As the community moves toward designing positive computing technologies to support child well-being, it is important to use a more participatory process that directly engages children's voices."
887,1,"We addressed these questions through a content analysis of 434 design ideas, 51 sketches, and 8 prototype and videos, which emerged from a 14-session cooperative inquiry study with 12 child ""happiness inventors."" The study was part of a summer learning camp held at the children's middle school, which focused on teaching the invention process, teaching well-being skills drawn from positive psychology and related areas (gratitude, mindfulness, and problem solving), and iterating design ideas for technologies to support these skills."
888,2,"The children's ideas and prototypes revealed specific facets of how they interpreted gratitude (as thanking, being positive, and doing good things), mindfulness (as externally representing thought and emotions, controlling those thoughts and emotions, getting through unpleasant things, and avoiding forgetting something), and problem solving (as preventing bad decisions, seeking alternative solutions, and not dwelling on unproductive thoughts). "
889,2,This process also revealed that children emphasized particular technologies in their solutions. 
890,2,"While desktop or laptop solutions were notably lacking, other ideas were roughly evenly distributed between mobile apps and embodied computing technologies (toys, wearables, etc). "
891,2,"We also report on desired functionalities and approaches to engagement in the children's ideas, such as a notable emphasis on representing and responding to internal states."
892,3,"Our findings point to promising directions for the design of positive computing technologies targeted at children, with particular emphases on the perspectives, technologies, engagement approaches, and functionalities that appealed to the children in our study. "
893,3,The dual focus of the study on teaching skills while designing technologies is a novel methodology in the design of positive computing technologies intended to increase child well-being.
894,4,Education-Based Gaps in eHealth: A Weighted Logistic Regression Approach
895,0,"Persons with a college degree are more likely to engage in eHealth behaviors than persons without a college degree, compounding the health disadvantages of undereducated groups in the United States. "
896,0,"However, the extent to which quality of recent eHealth experience reduces the education-based eHealth gap is unexplored."
897,1,"Based on a nationally representative sample of adults who reported using the Internet to conduct the most recent health information search (n=1458), I evaluated eHealth search experience in relation to the likelihood of engaging in different eHealth behaviors. "
898,1,I examined whether Internet health information search experience reduces the eHealth behavior gaps among college-educated and noncollege-educated adults. 
899,1,Weighted logistic regression models were used to estimate the probability of different eHealth behaviors.
900,0,"Quality of life (QoL) questionnaires are desirable for clinical practice but can be time-consuming to administer and interpret, making their widespread adoption difficult."
901,1,"We used data from the UK WHOQOL-100 questionnaire (N=320) to calibrate item banks using item response theory, which included psychometric assessments of differential item functioning, local dependency, unidimensionality, and reliability. "
902,1,We simulated CATs to assess the number of items administered before prespecified levels of reliability was met.
903,2,"The item banks (40 items) all displayed good model fit (P>.01) and were unidimensional (fewer than 5% of t tests significant), reliable (Person Separation Index>.70), and free from differential item functioning (no significant analysis of variance interaction) or local dependency (residual correlations <+.20). "
904,2,"When matched for reliability, the item banks were between 45% and 75% shorter than paper-based WHOQOL measures. "
905,2,"Across the four domains, a high standard of reliability (alpha>.90) could be gained with a median of 9 items."
906,3,"Using CAT, simulated assessments were as reliable as paper-based forms of the WHOQOL with a fraction of the number of items. "
907,3,These properties suggest that these item banks are suitable for computerized adaptive assessment. 
908,3,These item banks have the potential for international development using existing alternative language versions of the WHOQOL items.
909,4,An Internet-Based Intervention for Depression in Primary Care in Spain: A Randomized Controlled Trial
910,0,Depression is the most prevalent cause of illness-induced disability worldwide. 
911,0,"Face-to-face psychotherapeutic interventions for depression can be challenging, so there is a need for other alternatives that allow these interventions to be offered. "
912,0,One feasible alternative is Internet-based psychological interventions. 
913,0,This is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the effectiveness of an Internet-based intervention on depression in primary health care in Spain.
914,1,"Multicenter, three-arm, parallel, RCT design, carried out between November 2012 and January 2014, with a follow-up of 15 months. "
915,1,"In total, 296 adults from primary care settings in four Spanish regions, with mild or moderate major depression, were randomized to LITG (n=96), CSG (n=98), or iTAU (n=102). "
916,1,Research completers at follow-up were 63.5%. 
917,1,"The intervention was Smiling is Fun, an Internet program based on cognitive behavioral therapy. "
918,1,All patients received iTAU by their general practitioners. 
919,1,"Moreover, LITG received Smiling is Fun and the possibility of psychotherapeutic support on request by email, whereas CSG received only Smiling is Fun. "
920,1,The main outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory-II at 3 months from baseline. 
921,1,Mixed-effects multilevel analysis for repeated measures were undertaken.
922,2,"There was no benefit for either CSG [(B coefficient=-1.15; P=.444)] or LITG [(B=-0.71; P=.634)] compared to iTAU, at 3 months. "
923,2,There were differences at 6 months [ iTAU vs CSG (B=-4.22; P=.007); iTAU vs LITG (B=-4.34; P=.005)] and 15 months [iTAU vs CSG (B=-5.10; P=.001); iTAU vs LITG (B=-4.62; P=.002)]. 
924,2,There were no differences between CSG and LITG at any time. 
925,2,Adjusted and intention-to-treat models confirmed these findings.
926,3,An Internet-based intervention for depression combined with iTAU conferred a benefit over iTAU alone in the Spanish primary health care system.
927,4,The Sydney West Knowledge Portal: Evaluating the Growth of a Knowledge Portal to Support Translational Research
928,0,The Sydney West Translational Cancer Research Centre is an organization funded to build capacity for translational research in cancer. 
929,0,Translational research is essential for ensuring the integration of best available evidence into practice and for improving patient outcomes. 
930,0,"However, there is a low level of awareness regarding what it is and how to conduct it optimally. "
931,0,One solution to addressing this gap is the design and deployment of web-based knowledge portals to disseminate new knowledge and engage with and connect dispersed networks of researchers. 
932,0,A knowledge portal is an web-based platform for increasing knowledge dissemination and management in a specialized area.
933,1,An adaptive methodology was used to capture the design and growth of an web-based knowledge portal in cancer. 
934,1,This involved stakeholder consultations to inform initial design of the portal. 
935,1,"Once the portal was live, site analytics were reviewed to evaluate member usage of the portal and to measure growth in membership."
936,2,"Knowledge portal membership grew consistently for the first 18 months after deployment, before leveling out. "
937,2,"Analysis of site metrics revealed members were most likely to visit portal pages with community-generated content, particularly pages with a focus on translational research. "
938,2,This was closely followed by pages that disseminated educational material about translational research.
939,3,Preliminary data from this study suggest that knowledge portals may be beneficial tools for translating new evidence and fostering an environment of communication and collaboration.
940,4,Patient-Reported Safety Events in Chronic Kidney Disease Recorded With an Interactive Voice-Inquiry Dial-Response System: Monthly Report Analysis
941,0,Monitoring patient-reported outcomes (PROs) may improve safety of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
942,1,This was a 6-month study of Stage III-V CKD patients in the Safe Kidney Care (SKC) study. 
943,1,Participants crossed over from a paper diary to the IVDRS for recording patient-reported safety events defined as symptoms or events attributable to medications or care. 
944,1,The IVDRS was adapted from the SKC paper diary to record event frequency and remediation. 
945,1,Participants were auto-called weekly and permitted to self-initiate calls. 
946,1,Monthly reports were reviewed by two physician adjudicators for their clinical significance.
947,2,52 participants were followed over a total of 1384 weeks. 
948,2,28 out of 52 participants (54%) reported events using the IVDRS versus 8 out of 52 (15%) with the paper diary; hypoglycemia was the most common event for both methods. 
949,2,All IVDRS menu options were selected at least once except for confusion and rash. 
950,2,"Events were reported on 121 calls, with 8 calls reporting event remediation by ambulance or emergency room (ER) visit. "
951,2,"The event rate with the IVDRS and paper diary, with and without hypoglycemia, was 26.7 versus 4.7 and 18.3 versus 0.8 per 100 person weeks, respectively (P=.002 and P<. "
952,2,001). 
953,2,"The frequent users (ie, > 10 events) largely differed by method, and event rates excluding the most frequent user of each were 16.9 versus 2.5 per 100 person weeks, respectively (P<. "
954,2,001). 
955,2,"Adjudicators found approximately half the 80 reports clinically significant, with about a quarter judged as actionable. "
956,2,Hypoglycemia was often associated with additional reports of fatigue and falling. 
957,2,Participants expressed favorable satisfaction with the IVDRS.
958,3,Use of the IVDRS among CKD patients reveals a high frequency of clinically significant safety events and has the potential to be used as an important supplement to clinical care for improving patient safety.
959,4,Hearing Tests on Mobile Devices: Evaluation of the Reference Sound Level by Means of Biological Calibration
960,0,Hearing tests carried out in home setting by means of mobile devices require previous calibration of the reference sound level. 
961,0,Mobile devices with bundled headphones create a possibility of applying the predefined level for a particular model as an alternative to calibrating each device separately.
962,1,"Reference sound levels for Android-based mobile devices were determined using an open access mobile phone app by means of biological calibration, that is, in relation to the normal-hearing threshold. "
963,1,The examinations were conducted in 2 groups: an uncontrolled and a controlled one. 
964,1,"In the uncontrolled group, the fully automated self-measurements were carried out in home conditions by 18- to 35-year-old subjects, without prior hearing problems, recruited online. "
965,1,Calibration was conducted as a preliminary step in preparation for further examination. 
966,1,"In the controlled group, audiologist-assisted examinations were performed in a sound booth, on normal-hearing subjects verified through pure-tone audiometry, recruited offline from among the workers and patients of the clinic. "
967,1,"In both the groups, the reference sound levels were determined on a subject's mobile device using the Bekesy audiometry. "
968,1,The reference sound levels were compared between the groups. 
969,1,Intramodel and intermodel analyses were carried out as well.
970,2,"In the uncontrolled group, 8988 calibrations were conducted on 8620 different devices representing 2040 models. "
971,2,"In the controlled group, 158 calibrations (test and retest) were conducted on 79 devices representing 50 models. "
972,2,Result analysis was performed for 10 most frequently used models in both the groups. 
973,2,The difference in reference sound levels between uncontrolled and controlled groups was 1.50 dB (SD 4.42). 
974,2,The mean SD of the reference sound level determined for devices within the same model was 4.03 dB (95% CI 3.93-4.11). 
975,2,Statistically significant differences were found across models.
976,3,Reference sound levels determined in the uncontrolled group are comparable to the values obtained in the controlled group. 
977,3,This validates the use of biological calibration in the uncontrolled group for determining the predefined reference sound level for new devices. 
978,3,"Moreover, due to a relatively small deviation of the reference sound level for devices of the same model, it is feasible to conduct hearing screening on devices calibrated with the predefined reference sound level."
979,4,The Effectiveness of Self-Management Mobile Phone and Tablet Apps in Long-term Condition Management: A Systematic Review
980,0,"Long-term conditions and their concomitant management place considerable pressure on patients, communities, and health care systems worldwide. "
981,0,International clinical guidelines on the majority of long-term conditions recommend the inclusion of self-management programs in routine management. 
982,0,"Self-management programs have been associated with improved health outcomes; however, the successful and sustainable transfer of research programs into clinical practice has been inconsistent. "
983,0,"Recent developments in mobile technology, such as mobile phone and tablet computer apps, could help in developing a platform for the delivery of self-management interventions that are adaptable, of low cost, and easily accessible."
984,1,"We searched PubMed, Embase, EBSCO databases, the Cochrane Library, and The Joanna Briggs Institute Library for randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of mobile phone and tablet apps in self-management of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung diseases from 2005-2016. "
985,1,"We searched registers of current and ongoing trials, as well as the gray literature. "
986,1,We then checked the reference lists of all primary studies and review papers for additional references. 
987,1,The last search was run in February 2016.
988,2,"Of the 9 papers we reviewed, 6 of the interventions demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the primary measure of clinical outcome. "
989,2,"Where the intervention comprised an app only, 3 studies demonstrated a statistically significant improvement. "
990,2,"Interventions to address diabetes mellitus (5/9) were the most common, followed by chronic lung disease (3/9) and cardiovascular disease (1/9). "
991,2,A total of 3 studies included multiple intervention groups using permutations of an intervention involving an app. 
992,2,"The duration of the intervention ranged from 6 weeks to 1 year, and final follow-up data ranged from 3 months to 1 year. "
993,2,Sample size ranged from 48 to 288 participants.
994,3,The evidence indicates the potential of apps in improving symptom management through self-management interventions. 
995,3,The use of apps in mHealth has the potential to improve health outcomes among those living with chronic diseases through enhanced symptom control. 
996,3,"Further innovation, optimization, and rigorous research around the potential of apps in mHealth technology will move the field toward the reality of improved health care delivery and outcomes."
997,4,"Differences in Access to and Preferences for Using Patient Portals and Other eHealth Technologies Based on Race, Ethnicity, and Age: A Database and Survey Study of Seniors in a Large Health Plan"
998,0,Patients are being encouraged to go online to obtain health information and interact with their health care systems. 
999,0,"However, a 2014 survey found that less than 60% of American adults aged 65 and older use the Internet, with much lower usage among black and Latino seniors compared with non-Hispanic white seniors, and among older versus younger seniors."
1000,1,We conducted two studies of seniors aged 65-79 years. 
1001,1,"First, we used administrative data about patient portal account status and utilization in 2013 for a large cohort of English-speaking non-Hispanic white (n=183,565), black (n=16,898), Latino (n=12,409), Filipino (n=11,896), and Chinese (n=6314) members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health plan. "
1002,1,"Second, we used data from a mailed survey conducted in 2013-2014 with a stratified random sample of this population (final sample: 849 non-Hispanic white, 567 black, 653 Latino, 219 Filipino, and 314 Chinese). "
1003,1,These data were used to examine race/ethnic and age disparities in patient portal use and readiness and preferences for using digital communication for health-related purposes.
1004,2,"Adults aged 70-74 and 75-79 were significantly less likely than 65-69 year olds to be registered to use the patient portal, and among those registered, to have used the portal to send messages, view lab test results, or order prescription refills. "
1005,2,"Across all age groups, non-Hispanic whites and Chinese seniors were significantly more likely than black, Latino, and Filipino seniors to be registered and to have performed these actions. "
1006,2,"The survey found that black, Latino, and Filipino seniors and those 75 years old and older were significantly less likely to own digital devices (eg, computers, smartphones), use the Internet and email, and be able and willing to use digital technology to perform health care-related tasks, including obtaining health information, than non-Hispanic whites, Chinese, and younger seniors (aged 65-69), respectively. "
1007,2,The preference for using non-digital modalities persisted even among Internet users.
1008,3,"Health plans, government agencies, and other organizations that serve diverse groups of seniors should include social determinants such as race/ethnicity and age when monitoring trends in eHealth to ensure that eHealth disparities do not induce greater health status and health care disparities between more privileged and less privileged groups."
1009,4,Text Messaging for Exercise Promotion in Older Adults From an Upper-Middle-Income Country: Randomized Controlled Trial
1010,0,"Mobile technology to promote exercise is effective; however, most evidence is from studies of younger groups in high-income countries. "
1011,0,Investigating if short message service (SMS) texting can affect exercise participation in older adults from an upper-middle-income country is important considering the proliferation of mobile phones in developing regions and the increased interest of older adults in using mobile phones.
1012,1,"The Malaysian Physical Activity for Health Study (myPAtHS) was a 24-week, 2-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted in urban Malaysia. "
1013,1,Participants were recruited via health talks in resident associations and religious facilities. 
1014,1,Older Malaysians (aged 55-70 years) who used mobile phones and did not exercise regularly were eligible to participate in the study. 
1015,1,Participants randomly allocated to the SMS texting arm received an exercise booklet and 5 weekly SMS text messages over 12 weeks. 
1016,1,The content of the SMS text messages was derived from effective behavior change techniques. 
1017,1,The non-SMS texting arm participants received only the exercise booklet. 
1018,1,"Home visits were conducted to collect outcome data: (1) exercise frequency at 12 and 24 weeks, (2) secondary outcome data (exercise self-efficacy, physical activity-related energy expenditure, sitting time, body mass index, grip and leg strength) at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks. "
1019,1,Intention-to-treat procedures were applied for data analysis. 
1020,1,Semistructured interviews focusing primarily on the SMS text messages and their impact on exercise frequency were conducted at weeks 12 and 24.
1021,2,"In total, 43 participants were randomized into the SMS texting arm (n=22) and the non-SMS texting arm (n=21). "
1022,2,Study-unrelated injuries forced 4 participants to discontinue after a few weeks (they were not included in any analyses). 
1023,2,Overall retention was 86% (37/43). 
1024,2,"After 12 weeks, SMS texting arm participants exercised significantly more than non-SMS texting arm participants (mean difference 1.21 times, bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap [BCa] 95% CI 0.18-2.24). "
1025,2,Interview analysis revealed that the SMS text messages positively influenced SMS texting arm participants who experienced exercise barriers. 
1026,2,"They described the SMS text messages as being encouraging, a push, and a reminder. "
1027,2,"After 24 weeks, there was no significant difference between the research arms (mean difference 0.74, BCa 95% CI-0.30 to 1.76). "
1028,2,There were no significant effects for secondary outcomes.
1029,3,This study provides evidence that SMS text messaging is effective in promoting exercise in older adults from an upper-middle-income country. 
1030,3,"Although the effects were not maintained when SMS text messaging ceased, the results are promising and warrant more research on behavioral mobile health interventions in other regions.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02123342; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02123342 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6eGSsu2EI)."
1031,4,Epidemic Wave Dynamics Attributable to Urban Community Structure: A Theoretical Characterization of Disease Transmission in a Large Network
1032,0,"Multiple waves of transmission during infectious disease epidemics represent a major public health challenge, but the ecological and behavioral drivers of epidemic resurgence are poorly understood. "
1033,0,"In theory, community structure-aggregation into highly intraconnected and loosely interconnected social groups-within human populations may lead to punctuated outbreaks as diseases progress from one community to the next. "
1034,0,"However, this explanation has been largely overlooked in favor of temporal shifts in environmental conditions and human behavior and because of the difficulties associated with estimating large-scale contact patterns."
1035,1,We used an extensive dataset of proximal physical contacts between users of a public Wi-Fi Internet system to evaluate the epidemiological implications of an empirical urban contact network. 
1036,1,We characterized the modularity (community structure) of the network and then estimated epidemic dynamics under a percolation-based model of infectious disease spread on the network. 
1037,1,We classified simulated epidemics as multiwave using a novel metric and we identified network structures that were critical to the network's ability to produce multiwave epidemics.
1038,2,"We identified robust community structure in a large, empirical urban contact network from which multiwave epidemics may emerge naturally. "
1039,2,This pattern was fueled by a special kind of insularity in which locally popular individuals were not the ones forging contacts with more distant social groups.
1040,3,Our results suggest that ordinary contact patterns can produce multiwave epidemics at the scale of a single urban area without the temporal shifts that are usually assumed to be responsible. 
1041,3,"Understanding the role of community structure in epidemic dynamics allows officials to anticipate epidemic resurgence without having to forecast future changes in hosts, pathogens, or the environment."
1042,4,Web-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Female Patients With Eating Disorders: Randomized Controlled Trial
1043,0,"Many patients with eating disorders do not receive help for their symptoms, even though these disorders have severe morbidity. "
1044,0,The Internet may offer alternative low-threshold treatment interventions.
1045,1,"A two-arm open randomized controlled trial comparing a Web-based CBT intervention to a waiting list control condition (WL) was carried out among female patients with bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS). "
1046,1,"The eating disorder diagnosis was in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, and was established based on participants' self-report. "
1047,1,"Participants were recruited from an open-access website, and the intervention consisted of a structured two-part program within a secure Web-based application. "
1048,1,"The aim of the first part was to analyze participant's eating attitudes and behaviors, while the second part focused on behavioral change. "
1049,1,"Participants had asynchronous contact with a personal therapist twice a week, solely via the Internet. "
1050,1,"Self-report measures of eating disorder psychopathology (primary outcome), body dissatisfaction, physical health, mental health, self-esteem, quality of life, and social functioning were completed at baseline and posttest."
1051,2,A total of 214 participants were randomized to either the Web-based CBT group (n=108) or to the WL group (n=106) stratified by type of eating disorder (BN: n=44; BED: n=85; EDNOS: n=85). 
1052,2,Study attrition was low with 94% of the participants completing the posttest assignment. 
1053,2,"Overall, Web-based CBT showed a significant improvement over time for eating disorder psychopathology (F-97=63.07, P<.001, d=.82) and all secondary outcome measures (effect sizes between d=.34 to d=.49), except for Body Mass Index. "
1054,2,"WL participants also improved on most outcomes; however, effects were smaller in this group with significant between-group effects for eating disorder psychopathology (F-201=9.42, P=.002, d=.44), body dissatisfaction (F-201=13.16, P<.001, d=.42), physical health (F-200=12.55, P<.001, d=.28), mental health (F-203=4.88, P=.028, d=.24), self-esteem (F-202=5.06, P=.026, d=.20), and social functioning (F-205=7.93, P=.005, d=.29). "
1055,2,"Analyses for the individual subgroups BN, BED, and EDNOS showed that eating disorder psychopathology improved significantly over time among Web-based CBT participants in all three subgroups; however, the between-group effect was significant only for participants with BED (F-78=4.25, P=.043, d=.61)."
1056,3,Web-based CBT proved to be effective in improving eating disorder psychopathology and related health among female patients with eating disorders.
1057,4,Low Health Literacy and Evaluation of Online Health Information: A Systematic Review of the Literature
1058,0,Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in consumer online health information seeking. 
1059,0,"The quality of online health information, however, remains questionable. "
1060,0,"The issue of information evaluation has become a hot topic, leading to the development of guidelines and checklists to design high-quality online health information. "
1061,0,"However, little attention has been devoted to how consumers, in particular people with low health literacy, evaluate online health information."
1062,1,"Five academic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Communication and Mass-media Complete) were systematically searched. "
1063,1,We included peer-reviewed publications investigating differences in the evaluation of online information between people with different health literacy levels.
1064,2,"After abstract and full-text screening, 38 articles were included in the review. "
1065,2,Only four studies investigated the specific role of low health literacy in the evaluation of online health information. 
1066,2,"The other studies examined the association between educational level or other skills-based proxies for health literacy, such as general literacy, and outcomes. "
1067,2,Results indicate that low health literacy (and related skills) are negatively related to the ability to evaluate online health information and trust in online health information. 
1068,2,Evidence on the association with perceived quality of online health information and use of evaluation criteria is inconclusive.
1069,3,The findings indicate that low health literacy (and related skills) play a role in the evaluation of online health information. 
1070,3,This topic is therefore worth more scholarly attention. 
1071,3,"Based on the results of this review, future research in this field should (1) specifically focus on health literacy, (2) devote more attention to the identification of the different criteria people use to evaluate online health information, (3) develop shared definitions and measures for the most commonly used outcomes in the field of evaluation of online health information, and (4) assess the relationship between the different evaluative dimensions and the role played by health literacy in shaping their interplay."
1072,4,Utilizing the Wikidata System to Improve the Quality of Medical Content in Wikipedia in Diverse Languages: A Pilot Study
1073,0,Wikipedia is an important source of medical information for both patients and medical professionals. 
1074,0,"Given its wide reach, improving the quality, completeness, and accessibility of medical information on Wikipedia could have a positive impact on global health."
1075,1,We set up an automated process for integrating data from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) high priority DDI list into Wikidata. 
1076,1,We set up exemplary implementations demonstrating how the DDI data we introduced into Wikidata could be displayed in Wikipedia articles in diverse languages. 
1077,1,"Finally, we conducted a pilot analysis to explore if adding the ONC high priority data would substantially enhance the information currently available on Wikipedia."
1078,2,We derived 1150 unique interactions from the ONC high priority list. 
1079,2,Integration of the potential DDI data from Wikidata into Wikipedia articles proved to be straightforward and yielded useful results. 
1080,2,"We found that even though the majority of current English Wikipedia articles about pharmaceuticals contained sections detailing contraindications, only a small fraction of articles explicitly mentioned interaction partners from the ONC high priority list. "
1081,2,"For 91.30% (1050/1150) of the interaction pairs we tested, none of the 2 articles corresponding to the interacting substances explicitly mentioned the interaction partner. "
1082,2,"For 7.21% (83/1150) of the pairs, only 1 of the 2 associated Wikipedia articles mentioned the interaction partner; for only 1.48% (17/1150) of the pairs, both articles contained explicit mentions of the interaction partner."
1083,3,"Our prototype demonstrated that automated updating of medical content in Wikipedia through Wikidata is a viable option, albeit further refinements and community-wide consensus building are required before integration into public Wikipedia is possible. "
1084,3,A long-term endeavor to improve the medical information in Wikipedia through structured data representation and automated workflows might lead to a significant improvement of the quality of medical information in one of the world's most popular Web resources.
1085,4,Comparative and Cost Effectiveness of Telemedicine Versus Telephone Counseling for Smoking Cessation
1086,0,"In rural America, cigarette smoking is prevalent and health care providers lack the time and resources to help smokers quit. "
1087,0,"Telephone quitlines are important avenues for cessation services in rural areas, but they are poorly integrated with local health care resources."
1088,1,Smokers (n=566) were recruited offline from 20 primary care and safety net clinics across Kansas. 
1089,1,They were randomly assigned to receive 4 sessions of ITM or 4 sessions of Phone counseling. 
1090,1,"Patients in ITM received real-time video counseling, similar to Skype, delivered by computer/webcams in clinic exam rooms. "
1091,1,Three full-time equivalent trained counselors delivered the counseling. 
1092,1,The counseling duration and content was the same in both groups and was available in Spanish or English. 
1093,1,Both groups also received identical materials and assistance in selecting and obtaining cessation medications. 
1094,1,"The primary outcome was verified 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at month 12, using an intent-to-treat analysis."
1095,2,"There were no significant baseline differences between groups, and the trial achieved 88% follow-up at 12 months. "
1096,2,"Verified abstinence at 12 months did not significantly differ between ITM or Phone (9.8%, 27/280 vs 12%, 34/286; P=.406). "
1097,2,"Phone participants completed somewhat more counseling sessions than ITM ( mean 2.6, SD 1.5 vs mean 2.4, SD 1.5; P=.0837); however, participants in ITM were significantly more likely to use cessation medications than participants in Phone (55.9%, 128/280 vs 46.1%, 107/286; P=.03). "
1098,2,"Compared to Phone participants, ITM participants were significantly more likely to recommend the program to a family member or friend (P=.0075). "
1099,2,"From the combined provider plus participant (societal) perspective, Phone was significantly less costly than ITM. "
1100,2,Participants in ITM had to incur time and mileage costs to travel to clinics for ITM sessions. 
1101,2,"From the provider perspective, counseling costs were similar between ITM (US $45.46, SD 31.50) and Phone (US $49.58, SD 33.35); however, total provider costs varied widely depending on how the clinic space for delivering ITM was valued."
1102,3,Findings did not support the superiority of ITM over telephone counseling for helping rural patients quit smoking. 
1103,3,"ITM increased utilization of cessation pharmacotherapy and produced higher participant satisfaction, but Phone counseling was significantly less expensive. "
1104,3,"Future interventions could combine elements of both approaches to optimize pharmacotherapy utilization, counseling adherence, and satisfaction. "
1105,3,"Such an approach could commence with a telemedicine-delivered clinic office visit for pharmacotherapy guidance, and continue with telephone or real-time video counseling delivered via mobile phones to flexibly deliver behavioral support to patients where they most need it-in their homes and communities."
1106,4,3D Immersive Patient Simulators and Their Impact on Learning Success: A Thematic Review
1107,0,"Immersive patient simulators (IPSs) combine the simulation of virtual patients with a three-dimensional (3D) environment and, thus, allow an illusionary immersion into a synthetic world, similar to computer games. "
1108,0,"Playful learning in a 3D environment is motivating and allows repetitive training and internalization of medical workflows (ie, procedural knowledge) without compromising real patients. "
1109,0,The impact of this innovative educational concept on learning success requires review of feasibility and validity.
1110,1,"A systematic literature search via PubMed was performed using predefined inclusion criteria (ie, virtual worlds, focus on education of medical students, validation testing) to identify all available simulators. "
1111,1,Validation testing was defined as the primary end point.
1112,2,There are currently 13 immersive patient simulators available. 
1113,2,"Of these, 9 are Web-based simulators and represent feasibility studies. "
1114,2,None of these simulators are used routinely for student education. 
1115,2,The workstation-based simulators are commercially driven and show a higher quality in terms of graphical quality and/or data content. 
1116,2,"Out of the studies, 1 showed a positive correlation between simulated content and real content (ie, content validity). "
1117,2,"There was a positive correlation between the outcome of simulator training and alternative training methods (ie, concordance validity), and a positive coherence between measured outcome and future professional attitude and performance (ie, predictive validity)."
1118,3,IPSs can promote learning and consolidation of procedural knowledge. 
1119,3,"The use of immersive patient simulators is still marginal, and technical and educational approaches are heterogeneous. "
1120,3,"Academic-driven IPSs could possibly enhance the content quality, improve the validity level, and make this educational concept accessible to all medical students."
1121,4,Physiological and Brain Activity After a Combined Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Plus Video Game Therapy for Emotional Regulation in Bulimia Nervosa: A Case Report
1122,0,"PlayMancer is a video game designed to increase emotional regulation and reduce general impulsive behaviors, by training to decrease arousal and improve decision-making and planning. "
1123,0,We have previously demonstrated the usefulness of PlayMancer in reducing impulsivity and improving emotional regulation in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients. 
1124,0,"However, whether these improvements are actually translated into brain changes remains unclear."
1125,1,Ten VGT sessions were carried out on a weekly basis. 
1126,1,"Anxiety, physiological, and impulsivity measurements were recorded. "
1127,1,"The patient was scanned in a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner, prior to and after the 10-week VGT/CBT combined treatment, using two paradigms: (1) an emotional face-matching task, and (2) a multi-source interference task (MSIT)."
1128,2,"Upon completing the treatment, a decrease in average heart rate was observed. "
1129,2,The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results indicated a post-treatment reduction in reaction time along with high accuracy. 
1130,2,"The patient engaged areas typically active in healthy controls, although the cluster extension of the active areas decreased after the combined treatment."
1131,3,"These results suggest a global improvement in emotional regulation and impulsivity control after the VGT therapy in BN, demonstrated by both physiological and neural changes. "
1132,3,These promising results suggest that a combined treatment of CBT and VGT might lead to functional cerebral changes that ultimately translate into better cognitive and emotional performances.
1133,4,Changes Over Time in the Utilization of Disease-Related Internet Information in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients 2007 to 2013
1134,0,"As the number of people with Internet access rises, so does the use of the Internet as a potentially valuable source for health information. "
1135,0,Insight into patient use of this information and its correlates over time may reveal changes in the digital divide based on patient age and education. 
1136,0,Existing research has focused on patient characteristics that predict Internet information use and research on treatment context is rare.
1137,1,Data about utilization of the Internet for breast cancer-specific health information was obtained in a postal survey of breast cancer patients that is conducted annually in Germany with a steady response rate of 87% of consenting patients. 
1138,1,"Data from the survey were combined with data obtained by hospital personnel (eg, cancer stage and type of surgery). "
1139,1,"Data from 27,491 patients from 7 consecutive annual surveys were analyzed for this paper using multilevel regression modeling to account for clustering of patients in specific hospitals."
1140,2,Breast cancer patients seeking disease-specific information on the Internet increased significantly from 26.96% (853/3164) in 2007 to 37.21% (1485/3991) in 2013. 
1141,2,Similar patterns of demographic correlates were found for all 7 cohorts. 
1142,2,Older patients (>= 70 years) and patients with <10 years of formal education were less likely to use the Internet for information on topics related to their disease. 
1143,2,Internet use was significantly higher among privately insured patients and patients living with a partner. 
1144,2,Higher cancer stage and a foreign native language were associated with decreased use in the overall model. 
1145,2,Type of surgery was not found to be associated with Internet use in the multivariable models. 
1146,2,Intraclass correlation coefficients were small (0.00-0.03) suggesting only a small contribution of the hospital to the patients' decision to use Internet information. 
1147,2,There was no clear indication of a decreased digital divide based on age and education.
1148,3,Use of the Internet for health information is on the rise among breast cancer patients. 
1149,3,"The strong age-and education-related differences raise the question of how relevant information can be adequately provided to all patients, especially to those with limited education, older age, and living without a partner."
1150,4,Short-Term Effects of a Web-Based Guided Self-Help Intervention for Employees With Depressive Symptoms: Randomized Controlled Trial
1151,0,Depressive disorders are highly prevalent in the working population and are associated with excessive costs. 
1152,0,The evidence for effective worker-directed interventions for employees with depressive symptoms is limited. 
1153,0,Treating employees with depressive symptoms before sick leave via the Internet could be beneficial and cost saving.
1154,1,This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a Web-based guided self-help course to care as usual (CAU). 
1155,1,We recruited employees from 6 different companies via the companies' intranet and posters. 
1156,1,The main inclusion criterion was elevated depressive symptoms as measured by a score of >= 16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). 
1157,1,The intervention (Happy@Work) was based on problem-solving treatment and cognitive therapy and consisted of 6 weekly lessons. 
1158,1,Participants were asked to submit their weekly assignment via the website after completion. 
1159,1,They subsequently received feedback from a coach via the website. 
1160,1,"Self-report questionnaires on depressive symptoms (CES-D; primary outcome), anxiety measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), burnout measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and work performance measured by the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ; secondary outcomes) were completed at baseline and at posttreatment."
1161,2,A total of 231 employees were randomized to either the intervention group (n=116) or CAU (n=115). 
1162,2,The posttreatment assessment was completed by 171 (74.0%) participants. 
1163,2,"Both the intervention and the CAU group showed significant improvements in the primary outcome of depressive symptoms, but no differences between the conditions was found (d= 0.16, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.41, P=.29). "
1164,2,"Significant but small effects in favor of the intervention group were found for anxiety symptoms (d= 0.16, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.42, P=.04) and exhaustion (d= 0.17, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.43, P=.02)."
1165,3,This study showed that a Web-based guided self-help course for employees with depressive symptoms was not more effective in reducing depressive symptoms among employees than CAU. 
1166,3,Large improvements in depressive symptoms in the CAU group were unforeseen and potential explanations are discussed.
1167,4,Pain-QuILT: Clinical Feasibility of a Web-Based Visual Pain Assessment Tool in Adults With Chronic Pain
1168,0,Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating problem. 
1169,0,Accurate and timely pain assessment is critical to pain management. 
1170,0,"In particular, pain needs to be consistently tracked over time in order to gauge the effectiveness of different treatments. "
1171,0,"In current clinical practice, paper-based questionnaires are the norm for pain assessment. "
1172,0,"However, these methods are not conducive to capturing or tracking the complex sensations of chronic pain. "
1173,0,"Pain-QuILT (previously called the Iconic Pain Assessment Tool) is a Web-based tool for the visual self-report and tracking of pain (quality, intensity, location, tracker) in the form of time-stamped records. "
1174,0,"It has been iteratively developed and evaluated in adolescents and adults with chronic pain, including usability testing and content validation. "
1175,0,Clinical feasibility is an important stepping-stone toward widespread implementation of a new tool. 
1176,0,Our group has demonstrated Pain-QuILT clinical feasibility in the context of a pediatric chronic pain clinic. 
1177,0,"We sought to extend these findings by evaluating Pain-QuILT clinical feasibility from the perspective of adults with chronic pain, in comparison with standard paper-based methods (McGill Pain Questionnaire [MPQ] and Brief Pain Inventory [BPI])."
1178,1,Participants were recruited during a scheduled follow-up visit at a hospital-affiliated pain management and physical rehabilitation clinic in southwestern Ontario. 
1179,1,"Participants self-reported their current pain using the Pain-QuILT, MPQ, and BPI (randomized order). "
1180,1,A semistructured interview format was used to capture participant preferences for pain self-report.
1181,2,"The sample consisted of 50 adults (54% female, 27/50) with a mean age of 50 years. "
1182,2,Pain-QuILT was rated as significantly easier to use than both the MPQ and BPI (P<.01) and was also associated with the fewest difficulties in completion. 
1183,2,"On average, the time to complete each tool was less than 5 minutes. "
1184,2,"A majority of participants (58%,29/50) preferred Pain-QuILT for reporting their pain over alternate methods (16%, 8/50 for MPQ; 14%,7/50 for BPI; 12%,6/50 for ""other""). "
1185,2,The most commonly chosen pain descriptors on MPQ were matched with Pain-QuILT across 91% of categories. 
1186,2,"There was a moderate-to-high correlation between Pain-QuILT and BPI scores for pain intensity (r=.70, P<.01)."
1187,3,The results of this clinical feasibility study in adults with chronic pain are consistent with our previously published pediatric findings. 
1188,3,"Specifically, data indicate that Pain-QuILT is (1) easy to use, (2) quick to complete, (3) preferred by a majority of patients, and (4) correlated as expected with validated pain measures. "
1189,3,"As a digital, patient-friendly method of assessing and tracking pain, we conclude that Pain-QuILT has potential to add significant value as one standard component of chronic pain management."
1190,4,Can an Internet-Based Health Risk Assessment Highlight Problems of Heart Disease Risk Factor Awareness? A Cross-Sectional Analysis
1191,0,Health risk assessments are becoming more popular as a tool to conveniently and effectively reach community-dwelling adults who may be at risk for serious chronic conditions such as coronary heart disease (CHD). 
1192,0,The use of such instruments to improve adults' risk factor awareness and concordance with clinically measured risk factor values could be an opportunity to advance public health knowledge and build effective interventions.
1193,1,Data from an Internet-based cardiovascular health risk assessment (Heart Aware) administered to community-dwelling adults at 127 clinical sites were analyzed. 
1194,1,"Respondents were recruited through individual hospital marketing campaigns, such as media advertising and print media, found throughout inpatient and outpatient facilities. "
1195,1,CHD risk factors from the Framingham Heart Study were examined. 
1196,1,Weighted kappa statistics were calculated to measure interrater agreement between respondents' self-reported and clinically measured CHD risk factors. 
1197,1,Weighted kappa statistics were then calculated for each sample by strata of overall 10-year CHD risk. 
1198,1,"Three samples were drawn based on strategies for treating missing data: a listwise deleted sample, a pairwise deleted sample, and a multiple imputation (MI) sample."
1199,2,"The MI sample (n=16,879) was most appropriate for addressing missing data. "
1200,2,No CHD risk factor had better than marginal interrater agreement (kappa>.60). 
1201,2,"High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) exhibited suboptimal interrater agreement that deteriorated (eg, kappa<.30) as overall CHD risk increased. "
1202,2,"Conversely, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) interrater agreement improved (eg, up to kappa=.25) as overall CHD risk increased. "
1203,2,"Overall CHD risk of the sample was lower than comparative population-based CHD risk (ie, no more than 15% risk of CHD for the sample vs up to a 30% chance of CHD for the population)."
1204,3,Interventions are needed to improve knowledge of CHD risk factors. 
1205,3,Specific interventions should address perceptions of HDL-C and LCL-C. 
1206,3,"Internet-based health risk assessments such as Heart Aware may contribute to public health surveillance, but they must address selection bias of Internet-based recruitment methods."
1207,4,"Mapping Physician Twitter Networks: Describing How They Work as a First Step in Understanding Connectivity, Information Flow, and Message Diffusion"
1208,0,"Twitter is becoming an important tool in medicine, but there is little information on Twitter metrics. "
1209,0,"In order to recommend best practices for information dissemination and diffusion, it is important to first study and analyze the networks."
1210,1,"Open Twitter data was used to characterize four networks: the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American College of Physicians (ACP). "
1211,1,Data were collected between July 2012 and September 2012. 
1212,1,Visualization was used to understand the follower overlap between the groups. 
1213,1,Actual flow of the tweets for each group was assessed. 
1214,1,"Tweets were examined using Topsy, a Twitter data aggregator."
1215,2,The theoretical information dissemination potential for the groups is large. 
1216,2,"A collective community is emerging, where large percentages of individuals are following more than one of the groups. "
1217,2,"The overlap across groups is small, indicating a limited amount of community cohesion and cross-fertilization. "
1218,2,The AMA followers' network is not as active as the other networks. 
1219,2,The AMA posted the largest number of tweets while the AAP posted the fewest. 
1220,2,The number of retweets for each organization was low indicating dissemination that is far below its potential.
1221,3,"To increase the dissemination potential, medical groups should develop a more cohesive community of shared followers. "
1222,3,Tweet content must be engaging to provide a hook for retweeting and reaching potential audience. 
1223,3,"Next steps call for content analysis, assessment of the behavior and actions of the messengers and the recipients, and a larger-scale study that considers other medical groups using Twitter."
1224,4,Why Do Patients and Caregivers Seek Answers From the Internet and Online Lung Specialists? A Qualitative Study
1225,0,"Since its launch in 2003, the Dutch Lung Cancer Information Center's (DLIC) website has become increasingly popular. "
1226,0,"The most popular page of the website is the section ""Ask the Physician"", where visitors can ask an online lung specialist questions anonymously and receive an answer quickly. "
1227,0,Most questions were not only asked by lung cancer patients but also by their informal caregivers. 
1228,0,Most questions concerned specific information about lung cancer.
1229,1,"This research consisted of a qualitative study with semistructured telephone interviews about medical information-seeking behavior (eg, information needs, reasons for querying online specialists). "
1230,1,The sample comprised 5 lung cancer patients and 20 caregivers who posed a question on the interactive page of the DLIC website.
1231,2,Respondents used the Internet and the DLIC website to look for lung cancer-related information (general/specific to their personal situation) and to cope with cancer. 
1232,2,They tried to achieve a better understanding of the information given by their own specialist and wanted to be prepared for the treatment trajectory and disease course. 
1233,2,This mode of information supply helped them cope and gave them emotional support. 
1234,2,The interactive webpage was also used as a second opinion. 
1235,2,The absence of face-to-face contact made respondents feel freer to ask for any kind of information. 
1236,2,"By being able to pose a question instantly and receiving a relatively quick reply from the online specialist to urgent questions, respondents felt an easing of their anxiety as they did not have to wait until the next consultation with their own specialist."
1237,3,The DLIC website with its interactive page is a valuable complementary mode of information supply and supportive care for lung cancer patients and caregivers.
1238,4,Caught in the Web: A Review of Web-Based Suicide Prevention
1239,0,Suicide is a serious and increasing problem worldwide. 
1240,0,"The emergence of the digital world has had a tremendous impact on people's lives, both negative and positive, including an impact on suicidal behaviors."
1241,1,"The EBSCOhost (Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL), OvidSP, the Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect databases were searched for literature regarding Web-based suicide prevention strategies from 1997 to 2013 according to the modified PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. "
1242,1,The selected articles were subjected to quality rating and data extraction.
1243,2,"Good quality literature was surprisingly sparse, with only 15 fulfilling criteria for inclusion in the review, and most were rated as being medium to low quality. "
1244,2,"Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) reduced suicidal ideation in the general population in two randomized controlled trial (effect sizes, d=0.04-0.45) and in a clinical audit of depressed primary care patients. "
1245,2,Descriptive studies reported improved accessibility and reduced barriers to treatment with Internet among students. 
1246,2,"Besides automated iCBT, preventive strategies were mainly interactive (email communication, online individual or supervised group support) or information-based (website postings). "
1247,2,"The benefits and potential challenges of accessibility, anonymity, and text-based communication as key components for Web-based suicide prevention strategies were emphasized."
1248,3,There is preliminary evidence that suggests the probable benefit of Web-based strategies in suicide prevention. 
1249,3,Future larger systematic research is needed to confirm the effectiveness and risk benefit ratio of such strategies.
1250,4,The Influence of Two Different Invitation Letters on Chlamydia Testing Participation: Randomized Controlled Trial
1251,0,"In the Netherlands, screening for chlamydia (the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection worldwide) is a relatively simple and free procedure. "
1252,0,"Via an invitation letter sent by the public health services (PHS), people are asked to visit a website to request a test kit. "
1253,0,"They can then do a chlamydia test at home, send it anonymously to a laboratory, and, within two weeks, they can review their test results online and be treated by their general practitioner or the PHS. "
1254,0,"Unfortunately, the participation rates are low and the process is believed to be not (cost-) effective."
1255,1,"The original letter and a revised letter were randomly sent out to 13,551 citizens, 16 to 29 years old, in a Dutch municipality. "
1256,1,"Using behavior change theories, the revised letter sought to increase motivation to conduct chlamydia screening tests. "
1257,1,"The revised letter was tailored to beliefs that were found in earlier studies: risk perception, advantages and disadvantages (attitude), moral norm, social influence, and response-and self-efficacy. "
1258,1,"Revisions to the new letter also sought to avoid possible unwanted resistance caused when people feel pressured, and included prompts to trigger the desired behavior."
1259,2,No significant differences in test package requests were found between the two letters. 
1260,2,"There were also no differences between the original and revised letters in the rates of returned tests (11.80%, 581/4922 vs 11.07%, 549/4961) or positive test results (4.8%, 23/484 vs 4.1%, 19/460). "
1261,2,It is evident that the new letter did not improve participation compared to the original letter.
1262,3,It is clear that the approach of inviting the target population through a letter does not lead to higher participation rates for chlamydia screening. 
1263,3,Other approaches have to be developed and pilot tested.
1264,4,Exploring the Use and Effects of Deliberate Self-Harm Websites: An Internet-Based Study
1265,0,"In the United Kingdom, rates of deliberate self-harm (DSH) are rising. "
1266,0,"Alongside this, there has been an increase in the number of websites available with DSH content, and the Internet is known as a valuable resource for those who feel isolated by their condition(s). "
1267,0,"However, there is little and contradictory evidence available on the effects of using such websites. "
1268,0,Further research is therefore required to examine the use and effects of DSH websites.
1269,1,Data were collected by a questionnaire hosted on 20 websites with self-harm content. 
1270,1,Participants were self-selected from users of these sites. 
1271,1,Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and simple thematic analysis.
1272,2,"In total, 329 responses were received with 91.8% (302/329) from female site users. "
1273,2,"The majority of participants (65.6%, 187/285) visited these sites at least twice per week, and most participants used the sites to find information (78.2%, 223/285) or participate in the forums (68.4%, 195/285). "
1274,2,"Positive effects of website use such as gaining help and support, isolation reduction, and a reduction in self-harm behaviors were reported by a large number of participants. "
1275,2,"However, smaller but important numbers reported negative effects including worsened self-harm, being triggered to self-harm, and additional negative physical and psychological effects."
1276,3,This is the first multisite study to explore DSH website use in depth. 
1277,3,"There are clear and important benefits to engaging in website use for many individuals; however, these are not experienced by all website users. "
1278,3,"Negative effects were experienced by moderate numbers following website use, and clinicians should consider the impact of a patient's website use when consulting."
1279,4,"The Good, Bad, and Ugly of Online Recruitment of Parents for Health-Related Focus Groups: Lessons Learned"
1280,0,"We describe our experiences with identifying and recruiting Ontario parents through the Internet, primarily, as well as other modes, for participation in focus groups about adding the influenza vaccine to school-based immunization programs."
1281,1,"We used social media, deal forum websites, online classified ads, conventional mass media, and email lists to invite parents of school-aged children from Ontario, Canada to complete an online questionnaire to determine eligibility for focus groups. "
1282,1,"We compared responses and paradata when an incentive was provided and there were no software restrictions to the questionnaire (Period 1) to a period when only a single submission per Internet protocol (IP) address (ie, software restrictions invoked) was permitted and no incentive was provided (Period 2). "
1283,1,"We also compared the median time to complete a questionnaire, response patterns, and percentage of missing data between questionnaires classified as multiple submissions from the same Internet protocol (IP) address or email versus unique submissions. "
1284,1,Efficiency was calculated as the total number of hours study personnel devoted to an advertising mode divided by the resultant number of unique eligible completed questionnaires.
1285,2,"Of 1346 submitted questionnaires, 223 (16.6%) were incomplete and 34 (2.52%) did not meet the initial eligibility criteria. "
1286,2,"Of the remaining 1089 questionnaires, 246 (22.6%) were not from Ontario based on IP address and postal code, and 469 (43.1%) were submitted from the same IP address or email address (multiple submissions). "
1287,2,"In Period 2 vs Period 1, a larger proportion of questionnaires were submitted from Ontario (92.8%, 141/152 vs 75.1%, 702/937, P<.001), and a smaller proportion of same IP addresses (7.9%, 12/152 vs 47.1%, 441/937, P<.001) were received. "
1288,2,"Compared to those who made unique submissions, those who made multiple submissions spent less time per questionnaire (166 vs 215 seconds, P<.001), and had a higher percentage of missing data among their responses (15.0% vs 7.6%, P=.004). "
1289,2,"Advertisements posted on RedFlagDeals were the most efficient for recruitment (0.03 hours of staff time per questionnaire), whereas those placed on Twitter were the least efficient (3.64 hours of staff time per questionnaire)."
1290,3,Using multiple online advertising strategies was effective for recruiting a large sample of participants in a relatively short period time with minimal resources. 
1291,3,"However, risks such as multiple submissions and potentially fraudulent information need to be considered. "
1292,3,"In our study, these problems were associated with providing an incentive for responding, and could have been partially avoided by activating restrictive software features for online questionnaires."
1293,4,Enabling Community Through Social Media
1294,0,Social network analysis provides a perspective and method for inquiring into the structures that comprise online groups and communities. 
1295,0,Traces from interaction via social media provide the opportunity for understanding how a community is formed and maintained online.
1296,1,"Social network analysis was used to examine structures in a 1-month sample of Twitter messages with the hashtag #hcsmca (3871 tweets, 486 unique posters), which is the tag associated with the social media-supported group Health Care Social Media Canada. "
1297,1,"Network connections were considered present if the individual was mentioned, replied to, or had a post retweeted."
1298,2,"Network analyses revealed patterns of interaction that characterized the community as comprising one component, with a set of core participants prominent in the network due to their connections with others. "
1299,2,Analysis showed the social media health content providers were the most influential group based on in-degree centrality. 
1300,2,"However, there was no preferential attachment among people in the same professional group, indicating that the formation of connections among community members was not constrained by professional status."
1301,3,"Network analysis and visualizations provide techniques and a vocabulary for understanding online interaction, as well as insights that can help in understanding what, and who, comprises and sustains a network, and whether community emerges from a network of online interactions."
1302,4,An Internet-Based Intervention to Promote Mental Fitness for Mildly Depressed Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial
1303,0,Depression is a worldwide problem warranting global solutions to tackle it. 
1304,0,Enhancing well-being has benefits in its own right and could be a good strategy for preventing depression. 
1305,0,Providing well-being interventions via the Internet may have synergetic effects.
1306,1,We conducted a 2-armed randomized controlled trial that compared the effects of access to Psyfit for 2 months (n=143) to a waiting-list control condition (n=141). 
1307,1,Mild to moderately depressed adults in the general population seeking self-help were recruited. 
1308,1,"Primary outcome was well-being measured by Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) and WHO Well-being Index (WHO-5); secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, anxiety, vitality, and general health measured by Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety subscale (HADS-A), and Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form (MOS-SF) vitality and general health subscales, respectively. "
1309,1,"Online measurements were taken at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months after baseline."
1310,2,The dropout rate was 37.8% in the Psyfit group and 22.7% in the control group. 
1311,2,"At 2-month follow-up, Psyfit tended to be more effective in enhancing well-being (nonsignificantly for MHC-SF: Cohen's d=0.27, P=.06; significantly for WHO-5: Cohen's d=0.31, P=.01), compared to the waiting-list control group. "
1312,2,"For the secondary outcomes, small but significant effects were found for general health (Cohen's d=0.14, P=.01), vitality (d=0.22, P=.02), anxiety symptoms (Cohen's d=0.32, P=.001), and depressive symptoms (Cohen's d=0.36, P=.02). "
1313,2,"At 6-month follow-up, there were no significant effects on well-being (MHC-SF: Cohen's d=0.01, P=.90; WHO-5: Cohen's d=0.26, P=.11), whereas depressive symptoms (Cohen's d=0.35, P=.02) and anxiety symptoms (Cohen's d=0.35, P=.001) were still significantly reduced compared to the control group. "
1314,2,"There was no clear dose-response relationship between adherence and effectiveness, although some significant differences appeared across most outcomes in favor of those completing at least 1 lesson in the intervention."
1315,3,This study shows that an online well-being intervention can effectively enhance well-being (at least in the short-term and for 1 well-being measure) and can help to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms. 
1316,3,"Further research should focus on increasing adherence and motivation, reaching and serving lower-educated people, and widening the target group to include people with different levels of depressive symptoms."
1317,4,Online Access to Doctors Notes: Patient Concerns About Privacy
1318,0,"Offering patients online access to medical records, including doctors' visit notes, holds considerable potential to improve care. "
1319,0,"However, patients may worry about loss of privacy when accessing personal health information through Internet-based patient portals. "
1320,0,"The OpenNotes study provided patients at three US health care institutions with online access to their primary care doctors' notes and then collected survey data about their experiences, including their concerns about privacy before and after participation in the intervention."
1321,1,The design used a nested cohort study of patients surveyed at baseline and after a 1-year period during which they were invited to read their visit notes through secure patient portals. 
1322,1,"Participants consisted of 3874 primary care patients from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA), Geisinger Health System (Danville, PA), and Harborview Medical Center (Seattle, WA) who completed surveys before and after the OpenNotes intervention. "
1323,1,The measures were patient-reported levels of concern regarding privacy associated with online access to visit notes.
1324,2,32.91% of patients (1275/3874 respondents) reported concerns about privacy at baseline versus 36.63% (1419/3874 respondents) post-intervention. 
1325,2,"Baseline concerns were associated with non-white race/ethnicity and lower confidence in communicating with doctors, but were not associated with choosing to read notes or desire for continued online access post-intervention (nearly all patients with notes available chose to read them and wanted continued access). "
1326,2,"While the level of concern among most participants did not change during the intervention, 15.54% (602/3874 respondents, excluding participants who responded ""don't know"") reported more concern post-intervention, and 12.73% (493/3874 respondents, excluding participants who responded ""don't know"") reported less concern."
1327,3,"When considering online access to visit notes, approximately one-third of patients had concerns about privacy at baseline and post-intervention. "
1328,3,"These perceptions did not deter participants from accessing their notes, suggesting that the benefits of online access to medical records may outweigh patients' perceived risks to privacy."
1329,4,Enhancing Retention of an Internet-Based Cohort Study of Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM) via Text Messaging: Randomized Controlled Trial
1330,0,Black and Hispanic men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV in the United States. 
1331,0,"The Internet is a promising vehicle for delivery of HIV prevention interventions to these men, but retention of MSM of color in longitudinal Internet-based studies has been problematic. "
1332,0,Text message follow-up may enhance retention in these studies.
1333,1,Internet-using MSM were recruited through banner advertisements on social networking and Internet-dating sites. 
1334,1,"White, black, and Hispanic men who were >= 18, completed an online baseline survey, and returned an at-home HIV test kit, which tested HIV negative, were eligible. "
1335,1,Men were randomized to receive follow-up surveys every 2 months on the Internet or by text message for 12 months (unblinded). 
1336,1,"We used time-to-event methods to compare the rate of loss-to-follow-up (defined as non-response to a follow-up survey after multiple systematically-delivered contact attempts) in the 2 follow-up groups, overall and by race/ethnicity. "
1337,1,Results are reported as hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the rate of loss-to-follow-up for men randomized to text message follow-up compared to online follow-up.
1338,2,"Of 1489 eligible and consenting men who started the online baseline survey, 895 (60%) completed the survey and were sent an at-home HIV test kit. "
1339,2,"Of these, 710 of the 895 (79%) returned the at-home HIV test kit, tested HIV-negative, and were followed prospectively. "
1340,2,"The study cohort comprised 66% white men (470/710), 15% (106/710) black men, and 19% (134/710) Hispanic men. "
1341,2,"At 12 months, 77% (282/366) of men randomized to online follow-up were retained in the study, compared to 70% (241/344) men randomized to text message follow-up (HR=1.30, 95% CI 0.97-1.73). "
1342,2,"The rate of loss-to-follow-up was non-significantly higher in the text message arm compared to the online arm for both white (HR=1.43, 95% CI 0.97-1.73) and Hispanic men (HR=1.71, 95% CI 0.91-3.23); however, loss-to-follow-up among black men was non-significantly lower among those who received text message follow-up compared to online follow-up (HR=0.78, 95% CI 0.41-1.50). "
1343,2,"In the online arm, black men were significantly more likely to be lost to follow-up compared to white men (HR=2.25, 95% CI 1.36-3.71), but this was not the case in the text message arm (HR=1.23, 95% CI 0.70-2.16)."
1344,3,"We retained >70% of MSM enrolled in an online study for 12 months; thus, engaging men in online studies for a sufficient time to assess sustained outcomes is possible. "
1345,3,"Text message follow-up of an online cohort of MSM is feasible, and may result in higher retention among black MSM."
1346,4,Scoping Review on Search Queries and Social Media for Disease Surveillance: A Chronology of Innovation
1347,0,"The threat of a global pandemic posed by outbreaks of influenza H5N1 (1997) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2002), both diseases of zoonotic origin, provoked interest in improving early warning systems and reinforced the need for combining data from different sources. "
1348,0,It led to the use of search query data from search engines such as Google and Yahoo! 
1349,0,as an indicator of when and where influenza was occurring. 
1350,0,This methodology has subsequently been extended to other diseases and has led to experimentation with new types of social media for disease surveillance.
1351,1,"Structured scoping review methods were used to identify, characterize, and evaluate all published primary research, expert review, and commentary articles regarding the use of social media in surveillance of infectious diseases from 2002-2011."
1352,2,Thirty-two primary research articles and 19 reviews and case studies were identified as relevant. 
1353,2,"Most relevant citations were peer-reviewed journal articles (29/32, 91%) published in 2010-11 (28/32, 88%) and reported use of a Google program for surveillance of influenza. "
1354,2,Only four primary research articles investigated social media in the context of foodborne disease or gastroenteritis. 
1355,2,"Most authors (21/32 articles, 66%) reported that social media-based surveillance had comparable performance when compared to an existing surveillance program. "
1356,2,"The most commonly reported strengths of social media surveillance programs included their effectiveness (21/32, 66%) and rapid detection of disease (21/32, 66%). "
1357,2,"The most commonly reported weaknesses were the potential for false positive (16/32, 50%) and false negative (11/32, 34%) results. "
1358,2,"Most authors (24/32, 75%) recommended that social media programs should primarily be used to support existing surveillance programs."
1359,3,The use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance are relatively recent phenomena (first reported in 2006). 
1360,3,Both the tools themselves and the methodologies for exploiting them are evolving over time. 
1361,3,"While their accuracy, speed, and cost compare favorably with existing surveillance systems, the primary challenge is to refine the data signal by reducing surrounding noise. "
1362,3,"Further developments in digital disease surveillance have the potential to improve sensitivity and specificity, passively through advances in machine learning and actively through engagement of users. "
1363,3,"Adoption, even as supporting systems for existing surveillance, will entail a high level of familiarity with the tools and collaboration across jurisdictions."
1364,4,Major Infection Events Over 5 Years: How Is Media Coverage Influencing Online Information Needs of Health Care Professionals and the Public?
1365,0,The last decade witnessed turbulent events in public health. 
1366,0,"Emerging infections, increase of antimicrobial resistance, deliberately released threats and ongoing battles with common illnesses were amplified by the spread of disease through increased international travel. "
1367,0,"The Internet has dramatically changed the availability of information about outbreaks; however, little research has been done in comparing the online behavior of public and professionals around the same events and the effect of media coverage of outbreaks on information needs."
1368,1,"We used three longitudinal time-based datasets from mid-2006 until end of 2010: (1) a unique record of professional online behavior on UK infection portals: National electronic Library of Infection and National Resource of Infection Control (NeLI/NRIC), (2) equivalent public online information needs (Google Trends), and (3) relevant media coverage (LexisNexis). "
1369,1,"Analysis of NeLI/NRIC logs identified the highest interest around six major infectious diseases: Clostridium difficile (C difficile)/Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), tuberculosis, meningitis, norovirus, and influenza. "
1370,1,"After pre-processing, the datasets were analyzed and triangulated with each other."
1371,2,"Public information needs were more static, following the actual disease occurrence less than those of professionals, whose needs increase with public health events (eg, MRSA/C difficile) and the release of major national policies or important documents. "
1372,2,"Media coverage of events resulted in major public interest (eg, the 2007/2008 UK outbreak of C difficile/MRSA). "
1373,2,"An exception was norovirus, showing a seasonal pattern for both public and professionals, which matched the periodic disease occurrence. "
1374,2,Meningitis was a clear example of a disease with heightened media coverage tending to focus on individual and celebrity cases. 
1375,2,"Influenza was a major concern during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak creating massive public interest in line with the spring and autumn peaks in cases; although in autumn 2009, there was no corresponding increase in media coverage. "
1376,2,Online resources play an increasing role in fulfilling professionals' and public information needs.
1377,3,Significant factors related to a surge of professional interest around a disease were typically key publications and major policy changes. 
1378,3,Public interests seem more static and correlate with media influence but to a lesser extent than expected. 
1379,3,"The only exception was norovirus, exhibiting online public and professional interest correlating with seasonal occurrences of the disease. "
1380,3,"Public health agencies with responsibility for risk communication of public health events, in particular during outbreaks and emergencies, need to collaborate with media in order to ensure the coverage is high quality and evidence-based, while professionals' information needs remain mainly fulfilled by online open access to key resources."
1381,4,Cardiovascular Health Effects of Internet-Based Encouragements to Do Daily Workplace Stair-Walks: Randomized Controlled Trial
1382,0,"Although the hazardous health effects of a sedentary lifestyle are well known, many adults struggle with regular physical activity. "
1383,0,Simple and efficient encouragements for increased physical activity are needed.
1384,1,"A single-blind randomized controlled trial was performed at a large administrative company in Copenhagen, Denmark. "
1385,1,"Participants were 160 office workers (125 women, 35 men; mean age 42 years, SD 10; sitting 89.5% of work time). "
1386,1,"At baseline, aerobic fitness was 37 mL/min/kg (SD 9), mean blood pressure was 118/79 mmHg (SD 14/9), and mean body mass index (BMI) was 23 kg/m2 (SD 4). "
1387,1,Participants were randomly assigned (2: 1 ratio) to an email group receiving weekly email-based encouragements to walk the stairs for 10 minutes a day or to a control group receiving weekly reminders to continue their usual physical activities. 
1388,1,The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 10-week follow-up in aerobic fitness determined from a maximal cycle test. 
1389,1,The examiner was blinded to group allocation.
1390,2,"Adherence to the email encouragements was fairly high with 82.7% of the participants performing at least 3 sessions of 10-minute stair-walks per week (mean 3.3, SD 1.3). "
1391,2,Mean heart rate reached 167 beats/min (SD 10) during stair-walks. 
1392,2,"In the intention-to-treat analysis, aerobic fitness increased 1.45 mL/min/kg (95% CI 0.64-2.27) at 10-week follow-up in the email group compared with the control group. "
1393,2,"In participants with low aerobic fitness at baseline (n= 56), aerobic fitness increased 1.89 mL/min/kg (95% CI 0.53-3.24), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased 4.81 mmHg (95% CI 0.47-9.16) and 2.67 mmHg (95% CI 0.01-5.32), respectively, in the email group compared with the control group. "
1394,2,"Body weight decreased in the email group of those with low aerobic fitness compared with the control group, but this was not statistically significant."
1395,3,Simple and inexpensive email-based encouragements to do daily stair-walks together with colleagues at work improves cardiovascular health among adults in sedentary occupations. 
1396,3,There exists an enormous potential to prevent the hazardous health effects of a sedentary lifestyle through the use of email-based encouragements to do short bouts of physical activity at the workplace.
1397,4,Comparison of Physical Activity Measures Using Mobile Phone-Based CalFit and Actigraph
1398,0,"Epidemiological studies on physical activity often lack inexpensive, objective, valid, and reproducible tools for measuring physical activity levels of participants. "
1399,0,Novel sensing technologies built into smartphones offer the potential to fill this gap.
1400,1,"A sample of 36 participants from Barcelona, Spain, wore a smartphone with CalFit software and an Actigraph GT3X accelerometer for 5 days. "
1401,1,"The ease of use (usability) and physical activity measures from both devices were compared, including vertical axis counts (VT) and duration and energy expenditure predictions for light, moderate, and vigorous intensity from Freedson's algorithm. "
1402,1,"Statistical analyses included (1) Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test for usability measures, (2) Spearman correlation and linear regression for VT counts, (3) concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and (4) Bland-Altman plots for duration and energy expenditure measures."
1403,2,Approximately 64% (23/36) of participants were women. 
1404,2,Mean age was 31 years (SD 8) and mean body mass index was 22 kg/m(2) (SD 2). 
1405,2,"In total, 25/36 (69%) participants recorded at least 3 days with at least 10 recorded hours of physical activity using CalFit. "
1406,2,"The linear association and correlations for VT counts were high (adjusted R-2=0.85; correlation coefficient.932, 95% CI 0.931-0.933). "
1407,2,CCCs showed high agreement for duration and energy expenditure measures (from 0.83 to 0.91).
1408,3,The CalFit system had lower usability than the Actigraph GT3X because the application lacked a means to turn itself on each time the smartphone was powered on. 
1409,3,The CalFit system may provide valid estimates to quantify and classify physical activity. 
1410,3,CalFit may prove to be more cost-effective and easily deployed for large-scale population health studies than other specialized instruments because cell phones are already carried by many people.
1411,4,A Data Encryption Solution for Mobile Health Apps in Cooperation Environments
1412,0,Mobile Health (mHealth) proposes health care delivering anytime and anywhere. 
1413,0,"It aims to answer several emerging problems in health services, including the increasing number of chronic diseases, high costs on national health services, and the need to provide direct access to health services, regardless of time and place. "
1414,0,mHealth systems include the use of mobile devices and apps that interact with patients and caretakers. 
1415,0,"However, mobile devices present several constraints, such as processor, energy, and storage resource limitations. "
1416,0,The constant mobility and often- required Internet connectivity also exposes and compromises the privacy and confidentiality of health information.
1417,1,"First, we designed and deployed the DE4MHA. "
1418,1,"Then two studies were performed: (1) study and comparison of symmetric and asymmetric encryption/decryption algorithms in an mHealth app under a cooperation environment, and (2) performance evaluation of the DE4MHA. "
1419,1,"Its performance was evaluated through a prototype using an mHealth app for obesity prevention and cares, called SapoFit. "
1420,1,We then conducted an evaluation study of the mHealth app with cooperation mechanisms and the DE4MHA using real users and a real cooperation scenario. 
1421,1,"In 5 days, 5 different groups of 7 students selected randomly agreed to use and experiment the SapoFit app using the 7 devices available for trials."
1422,2,There were 35 users of SapoFit that participated in this study. 
1423,2,The performance evaluation of the app was done using 7 real mobile devices in 5 different days. 
1424,2,The results showed that confidentiality and protection of the users' health information was guaranteed and SapoFit users were able to use the mHealth app with satisfactory quality. 
1425,2,Results also showed that the app with the DE4MHA presented nearly the same results as the app without the DE4MHA. 
1426,2,The performance evaluation results considered the probability that a request was successfully answered as a function of the number of uncooperative nodes in the network. 
1427,2,The service delivery probability decreased with the increase of uncooperative mobile nodes. 
1428,2,"Using DE4MHA, it was observed that performance presented a slightly worse result. "
1429,2,"The service average was also slightly worse but practically insignificantly different than with DE4MHA, being considered negligible."
1430,3,"This paper proposed a data encryption solution for mobile health apps, called DE4MHA. "
1431,3,The data encryption algorithm DE4MHA with cooperation mechanisms in mobile health allow users to safely obtain health information with the data being carried securely. 
1432,3,"These security mechanisms did not deteriorate the overall network performance and the app, maintaining similar performance levels as without the encryption. "
1433,3,"More importantly, it offers a robust and reliable increase of privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of their health information. "
1434,3,"Although it was experimented on a specific mHealth app, SapoFit, both DE4MHA and the cooperation strategy can be deployed in other mHealth apps."
1435,1,"225 individuals who wanted to cease or reduce their cannabis use were recruited using both online and offline advertising methods and were randomly assigned to receive: (1) the web-based intervention, or (2) a control condition consisting of 6 modules of web-based educational information on cannabis. "
1436,1,"Assessments of cannabis use, dependence symptoms, and abuse symptoms were conducted through online questionnaires at baseline, and at 6-week and 3-month follow-ups. "
1437,1,Two sets of data analyses were undertaken-complier average causal effect (CACE) modeling and intention to treat (ITT).
1438,0,"Despite promising data in Western countries, there is a dearth of research into the efficacy of text messaging-based smoking cessation programs in other settings, including the Middle East, where smoking prevalence rates are higher."
1439,1,"This study was a small-scale, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Ankara, Turkey. "
1440,1,"Participants were adult daily smokers who were seriously thinking about quitting in the next 15 days and living in Ankara, Turkey. "
1441,1,"The text messaging intervention, SMS Turkey, provided 6 weeks of daily messages aimed at giving participants skills to help them quit smoking. "
1442,1,"Messages were sent in an automated fashion, except 2 days and 7 days after the initial quit day. "
1443,1,"On days 2 and 7, the research assistant manually assigned participants to content "" paths"" based on whether they were still not smoking or had relapsed. "
1444,1,The control arm received a brochure that provided similar information about smoking cessation. 
1445,1,"The main outcome measure was self-reported 3-month sustained abstinence, verified by carbon monoxide (CO) readings. "
1446,1,Neither participants nor researchers were blinded to arm assignment.
1447,2,The 151 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: 76 to the SMS Turkey intervention group and 75 to the brochure control group. 
1448,2,"Using intention to treat, all 151 participants were included in analyses. "
1449,2,"Three-month cessation trends were not significantly higher in the intervention group: 11% intervention vs 5% control had quit (chi(2) 1= 1.4, P=.24; R2= 2.0, 95% CI 0.62-6.3). "
1450,2,"When the sample was stratified by sex, female intervention participants (14%, n= 5) were significantly more likely to have quit at 3 months than female control participants (0%, n= 0;.2 1= 3.7, P=.05). "
1451,2,"Among light smokers (ie, those smoking less than 20 cigarettes per day), intervention participants (17%, n= 5) also were significantly more likely to have quit compared to control participants (0%, n= 0;.2 1= 5.3, P=.02). "
1452,2,We noted no difference in cessation rates for males or heavy smokers. 
1453,2,Participants experienced significant technology problems during the study. 
1454,2,Some participants received duplicate text messages at least once during the trial; others failed to receive some program messages. 
1455,2,"Neither receiving duplicate messages (chi(2) 1= 0.12, P=.73), or missing 5 or more program messages (chi(2) 1= 0.75, P=.39) negatively affected quitting rates."
1456,3,"Although the study was not powered to detect statistically significant differences, as the primary aim was to provide estimates of effect size that could be used to better inform a power analysis for a larger trial, findings provide optimism that SMS Turkey may be able to affect quitting rates in environments with high smoking prevalence, such as Ankara, Turkey. "
1457,3,The SMS Turkey software program did not work as well as it did 2 years previous. 
1458,3,The system will need to be updated to maintain software compatibility with ongoing technology evolution.
1459,4,Pro-Anorexia and Pro-Recovery Photo Sharing: A Tale of Two Warring Tribes
1460,0,There is widespread use of the Internet to promote anorexia as a lifestyle choice. 
1461,0,Pro-anorexia content can be harmful for people affected or at risk of having anorexia. 
1462,0,That movement is actively engaged in sharing photos on social networks such as Flickr.
1463,1,"The extraction of pro-anorexia and pro-recovery photographs from the photo sharing site Flickr pertaining to 242,710 photos from 491 users and analyzing four separate social networks therein."
1464,2,Pro-anorexia and pro-recovery communities interact to a much higher degree among themselves than what is expected from the distribution of contacts (only 59-72% of contacts but 74-83% of comments are made to members inside the community). 
1465,2,"Pro-recovery users employ similar words to those used by pro-anorexia users to describe their photographs, possibly in order to ensure that their content appears when pro-anorexia users search for images. "
1466,2,"Pro-anorexia users who are exposed to comments from the opposite camp are less likely to cease posting pro-anorexia photographs than those who do not receive such comments (46% versus 61%), and if they cease, they do so approximately three months later. "
1467,2,"Our observations show two highly active communities, where most interaction is within each community. "
1468,2,"However, the pro-recovery community takes steps to ensure that their content is visible to the pro-anorexia community, both by using textual descriptions of their photographs that are similar to those used by the pro-anorexia group and by commenting to pro-anorexia content. "
1469,2,"The latter activity is, however, counterproductive, as it entrenches pro-anorexia users in their stance."
1470,3,Our results highlight the nature of pro-anorexia and pro-recovery photo sharing and accentuate the need for clinicians to be aware of such content and its effect on their patients. 
1471,3,Our findings suggest that some currently used interventions are not useful in helping pro-anorexia users recover. 
1472,3,"Thus, future work should focus on new intervention methods, possibly tailored to individual characteristics. "
1473,4,Evaluation of End-User Satisfaction Among Employees Participating in a Web-based Health Risk Assessment With Tailored Feedback
1474,0,Web technology is increasingly being used to provide individuals with health risk assessments (HRAs) with tailored feedback. 
1475,0,"End-user satisfaction is an important determinant of the potential impact of HRAs, as this influences program attrition and adherence to behavioral advice."
1476,1,"Employees of seven companies in the Netherlands participated in a commercial, web-based, HRA with tailored feedback. "
1477,1,"The HRA consisted of four components: 1) a health and lifestyle assessment questionnaire, 2) a biometric evaluation, 3) a laboratory evaluation, and 4) tailored feedback consisting of a personal health risk profile and lifestyle behavior advice communicated through a web portal. "
1478,1,HRA respondents received an evaluation questionnaire after six weeks. 
1479,1,Satisfaction with different parts of the HRA was measured on 5-point Likert scales. 
1480,1,A free-text field provided the opportunity to make additional comments.
1481,2,"In total, 2289 employees participated in the HRA program, of which 637 (27.8%) completed the evaluation questionnaire. "
1482,2,Quantitative analysis showed that 85.6% of the respondents evaluated the overall HRA positively. 
1483,2,"The free-text field was filled in by 29.7 % of the respondents (189 out of 637), who made 315 separate remarks. "
1484,2,Qualitative evaluation of these data showed that these respondents made critical remarks. 
1485,2,"Respondents felt restricted by the answer categories of the health and lifestyle assessment questionnaire, which resulted in the feeling that the corresponding feedback could be inadequate. "
1486,2,"Some respondents perceived the personal risk profile as unnecessarily alarming or suggested providing more explanations, reference values, and a justification of the behavioral advice given. "
1487,2,Respondents also requested the opportunity to discuss the feedback with a health professional.
1488,3,Most people were satisfied with the web-based HRA with tailored feedback. 
1489,3,Sources of dissatisfaction were limited opportunities for providing additional health information outside of the predefined health and lifestyle assessment questionnaire and insufficient transparency on the generation of the feedback. 
1490,3,Information regarding the aim and content of the HRA should be clear and accurate to prevent unrealistic expectations among end-users. 
1491,3,Involving trusted health professionals in the implementation of web-based HRAs may enhance the use of and confidence in the HRA. 
1492,4,Mining Online Social Network Data for Biomedical Research: A Comparison of Clinicians and Patients Perceptions About Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Treatments
1493,0,"While only one drug is known to slow the progress of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), numerous drugs can be used to treat its symptoms. "
1494,0,"However, very few randomized controlled trials have assessed the efficacy, safety, and side effects of these drugs. "
1495,0,"Due to this lack of randomized controlled trials, consensus among clinicians on how to treat the wide range of ALS symptoms and the efficacy of these treatments is low. "
1496,0,"Given the lack of clinical trials data, the wide range of reported symptoms, and the low consensus among clinicians on how to treat those symptoms, data on the prevalence and efficacy of treatments from a patient's perspective could help advance the understanding of the symptomatic treatment of ALS."
1497,1,We used a survey of clinicians' perceptions by Forshew and Bromberg as our primary data source and adjusted the data from PatientsLikeMe to allow for comparisons. 
1498,1,We first extracted the 14 symptoms and associated top four treatments listed by Forshew and Bromberg. 
1499,1,We then searched the PatientsLikeMe database for the same symptom-treatment pairs. 
1500,1,The PatientsLikeMe data are structured and thus no preprocessing of the data was required.
1501,2,"After we eliminated pairs with a small sample, 15 symptom-treatment pairs remained. "
1502,2,All treatments identified as useful were prescription drugs. 
1503,2,We found similarities and discrepancies between clinicians' and patients' perceptions of treatment prevalence and efficacy. 
1504,2,"In 7 of the 15 pairs, the differences between the two groups were above 10%. "
1505,2,In 3 pairs the differences were above 20%. 
1506,2,Lorazepam to treat anxiety and quinine to treat muscle cramps were among the symptom-treatment pairs with high concordance between clinicians' and patients' perceptions. 
1507,2,"Conversely, amitriptyline to treat labile emotional effect and oxybutynin to treat urinary urgency displayed low agreement between clinicians and patients."
1508,3,Assessing and comparing the efficacy of the symptomatic treatment of a complex and rare disease such as ALS is not easy and needs to take both clinicians' and patients' perspectives into consideration. 
1509,3,"Drawing a reliable profile of treatment efficacy requires taking into consideration many interacting aspects (eg, disease stage and severity of symptoms) that were not covered in the present study. "
1510,3,"Nevertheless, pilot studies such as this one can pave the way for more robust studies by helping researchers anticipate and compensate for limitations in their data sources and study design."
1511,1,"We recruited 92 participants through general practitioners and randomly assigned them to a standard condition (receiving a pedometer-only intervention, n = 47) and a tailored condition (receiving a pedometer plus newly developed, automated, computer-tailored step advice intervention, n = 45). "
1512,1,"Step counts, self-reported data obtained via telephone interview on physical activity, time spent sitting, and body mass index were assessed at baseline and postintervention. "
1513,1,"The present sample was mostly female (54/92, 59%), highly educated (59/92, 64%), employed (65/92, 71%), and in good health (62/92, 67%)."
1514,0,Determinants of participation in health promotion programs are largely unknown. 
1515,0,"To evaluate and implement interventions, information is needed regarding their reach as well as regarding the characteristics of program users and non-users."
1516,1,Determinants of participation were investigated in a longitudinal study among employees from six workplaces participating in a two-year cluster randomized controlled trial. 
1517,1,The employees were invited by email to participate. 
1518,1,"At baseline, all participants visited a website to fill out the questionnaire on lifestyle, work, and health factors. "
1519,1,"Subsequently, a physical health check was offered, followed by face-to-face advice. "
1520,1,"Throughout the study period, all participants had access to a website with information on lifestyle and health, and to fully automated personalized feedback on the questionnaire results. "
1521,1,"Only participants in the intervention received monthly email messages to promote website visits during the first year and had access to additional Web-based tools (self-monitors, a food frequency questionnaire assessing saturated fat intake, and the possibility to ask questions) to support behavior change. "
1522,1,Website use was monitored by website statistics measuring access. 
1523,1,Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify characteristics of employees who participated in the program and used the website.
1524,2,"Complete baseline data were available for 924 employees (intervention: n=456, reference: n=468). "
1525,2,Lifestyle and health factors were not associated with initial participation. 
1526,2,Employees aged 30 years and older were more likely to start using the program and to sustain their participation. 
1527,2,"Workers with a low intention to increase their physical activity level were less likely to participate (Odds Ratio (OR)=0.60, 95% Confidence interval (95% CI), 0.43-0.85) but more likely to sustain participation throughout the study period (ORs ranging from 1.40 to 2.06). "
1528,2,"Furthermore, it was found that smokers were less likely to sustain their participation in the first and second year (OR=0.54, 95% CI 0.35-0.82) and to visit the website (OR=0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.96). "
1529,2,Website use was highest in the periods immediately after the baseline (73%) and follow-up questionnaires (71% and 87%). 
1530,2,"Employees in the intervention were more likely to visit the website in the period they received monthly emails (OR=5.88, 95% CI 3.75-9.20) but less likely to visit the website in the subsequent period (OR=0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85)."
1531,3,Modest initial participation and high attrition in program use were found. 
1532,3,"Workers with a low intention to change their behavior were less likely to participate, but once enrolled they were more likely to sustain their participation. "
1533,3,"Lifestyle and health indicators were not related to initial participation, but those with an unhealthy lifestyle were less likely to sustain. "
1534,3,This might influence program effectiveness. 
1535,3,"Regular email messages prompted website use, but the use of important Web-based tools was modest. "
1536,3,There is a need for more appealing techniques to enhance retention and to keep those individuals who need it most attracted to the program.
1537,4,Validation of an Informant-Reported Web-Based Data Collection to Assess Dementia Symptoms
1538,0,"The Web offers unprecedented access to the experience of people with dementia and their care partners, but data gathered online need to be validated to be useful."
1539,1,"In an online survey posted on the DementiaGuide website, care partners of people with dementia built individualized profiles from the 60-item SymptomGuide and completed a questionnaire, which included the DS and a staging tool."
1540,0,"In the United States, primary and secondary online schools are institutions that deliver online curricula for children enrolled in kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12). "
1541,0,"These institutions commonly provide opportunities for online instruction in conjunction with local schools for students who may need remediation, have advanced needs, encounter unqualified local instructors, or experience scheduling conflicts. "
1542,0,"Internet-based online schooling may potentially help children from populations known to have educational and health disadvantages, such as those from certain racial or ethnic backgrounds, those of low socioeconomic status, and children with special health care needs (CSHCN)."
1543,1,"We performed a brief parental survey in three states examining basic demographics and educational history of the child and parents, the child's health status as measured by the CSHCN Screener, and their experiences and educational achievement with online schools and class(es).Results were compared with state public-school demographics and statistical analyses controlled for state-specific independence."
1544,2,"We analyzed responses from 1971 parents with a response rate of 14.7% (1971/13,384). "
1545,2,"Parents of online-school participants were more likely to report having a bachelor's degree or higher than were parents of students statewide in traditional schools, and more of their children were white and female. "
1546,2,"Most notably, the prevalence of CSHCN was high (476/1971, 24.6%) in online schooling. "
1547,2,"Children who were male, black, or had special health care needs reported significantly lower grades in both traditional and online schools. "
1548,2,"However, when we controlled for age, gender, race, and parental education, parents of CSHCN or black children reported significantly lower grades in online than in traditional schooling (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.62 for CSHCN, P < .001; aOR 2.73, 95% CI 2.11-3.53 for black children, P < .001.) In contrast, parents with a bachelor's degree or higher reported significantly higher online-school grades than traditional-school grades for their children (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.15-1.82, P < .001)."
1549,3,The demographics of children attending online schools do not mirror those of the state-specific school populations. 
1550,3,CSHCN seem to opt into online schools at a higher rate. 
1551,3,"While parents report equivalent educational achievement in online and traditional classrooms, controlling for known achievement risks suggests that CSHCN and black children have lower performance in online than in traditional schools. "
1552,3,"Given the millions of students now in online schools, future studies must test whether direct assistance in online schools, such as taking individualized education plans into consideration, will narrow known disparities in educational success. "
1553,3,Only then can online schools emerge as a true educational alternative for at-risk populations.
1554,4,Breathe Easier Online: Evaluation of a Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial of an Internet-Based Intervention to Improve Well-being in Children and Adolescents With a Chronic Respiratory Condition
1555,0,Chronic respiratory illnesses are the most common group of childhood chronic health conditions and are overrepresented in socially isolated groups.
1556,1,"We randomly assigned 42 socially isolated children and adolescents (18 males), aged between 10 and 17 years to either a BEO (final n = 19) or a wait-list control (final n = 20) condition. "
1557,1,"In total, 3 participants (2 from BEO and 1 from control) did not complete the intervention. "
1558,1,Psychosocial well-being was operationalized through self-reported scores on depression symptoms and social problem solving. 
1559,1,Secondary outcome measures included self-reported attitudes toward their illness and spirometry results. 
1560,1,Paper-and-pencil questionnaires were completed at the hospital when participants attended a briefing session at baseline (time 1) and in their homes after the intervention for the BEO group or a matched 9-week time period for the wait-list group (time 2).
1561,2,The two groups were comparable at baseline across all demographic measures (all F < 1). 
1562,2,"For the primary outcome measures, there were no significant group differences on depression (P = .17) or social problem solving (P = .61). "
1563,2,"However, following the online intervention, those in the BEO group reported significantly lower depression (P = .04), less impulsive/careless problem solving (P = .01), and an improvement in positive attitude toward their illness (P = .04) compared with baseline. "
1564,2,The wait-list group did not show these differences. 
1565,2,Children in the BEO group and their parents rated the online modules very favorably.
1566,3,"Although there were no significant group differences on primary outcome measures, our pilot data provide tentative support for the feasibility (acceptability and user satisfaction) and initial efficacy of an Internet-based intervention for improving well-being in children and adolescents with a chronic respiratory condition."
1567,1,"Of the 1187 men and women recruited online, 781 were randomly allocated to one of four conditions: a CVD risk message, the same CVD risk message paired with planning, planning on its own, and a control group. "
1568,1,All outcome measures were assessed by online self-reports. 
1569,1,Generalized linear modeling was used to analyze the data.
1570,0,Previous interventions have shown promising results using theory-based podcasts to deliver a behavioral weight-loss intervention.
1571,1,"In this 6-month, minimal contact intervention, overweight (n = 96, body mass index 32.6 kg/m(2)) adults were recruited through television advertisements and email listservs and randomly assigned to Podcast-only or Podcast+Mobile groups. "
1572,1,Both groups received 2 podcasts per week for 3 months and 2 minipodcasts per week for months 3-6. 
1573,1,"In addition to the podcasts, the Podcast+Mobile group was also instructed to use a diet and physical activity monitoring application (app) on their mobile device and to interact with study counselors and other participants on Twitter."
1574,2,"Weight loss did not differ by group at 6 months: mean -2.7% (SD 5.6%) Podcast+Mobile, n = 47; mean -2.7% (SD 5.1%) Podcast, n = 49; P = .98. "
1575,2,"Days/week of reported diet monitoring did not differ between Podcast+Mobile (mean 2.3, SD 1.9 days/week) and Podcast groups (mean 1.9, SD 1.7 days/week; P = .28) but method of monitoring did differ. "
1576,2,"Podcast+Mobile participants were 3.5 times more likely than the Podcast group to use an app to monitor diet (P = .01), whereas the majority of Podcast participants reported using the Web (14/41, 34%) or paper (12/41, 29%). "
1577,2,There were more downloads per episode in the Podcast+Mobile group (1.4/person) than in the Podcast group (1.1/person; P < .001). 
1578,2,"The number of podcasts participants reported downloading over the 6-month period was significantly moderately correlated with weight loss in both the Podcast+Mobile (r = -.46, P = .001) and the Podcast (r = -.53, P < .001) groups. "
1579,2,"Podcast+Mobile participants felt more user control at 3 months (P = .02), but not at 6 months, and there was a trend (P = .06) toward greater elaboration among Podcast+Mobile participants. "
1580,2,There were significant differences in reported source of social support between groups. 
1581,2,"More Podcast participants relied on friends (11/40, 28% vs 4/40, 10%; P = .045) whereas Podcast+Mobile participants relied on online sources (10/40, 25% vs 0/40; P = .001)."
1582,3,"Results confirm and extend previous findings showing a minimally intensive weight-loss intervention can be delivered via podcast, but prompting and mobile communication via Twitter and monitoring app without feedback did not enhance weight loss."
1583,4,A Pilot Study of Motivational Interviewing Training in a Virtual World
1584,0,"Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based, patient-centered counseling strategy proven to support patients seeking health behavior change. "
1585,0,Yet the time and travel commitment for MI training is often a barrier to the adoption of MI by health care professionals. 
1586,0,Virtual worlds such as Second Life (SL) are rapidly becoming part of the educational technology landscape and offer not only the potential to improve access to MI training but also to deepen the MI training experience through the use of immersive online environments. 
1587,0,"Despite SL's potential for medical education applications, little work is published studying its use for this purpose and still less is known of educational outcomes for physician training in MI using a virtual-world platform."
1588,1,We designed and pilot tested an MI training program in the SL virtual world. 
1589,1,"We trained and enrolled 13 primary care physicians in a two-session, interactive program in SL on the use of MI for counseling patients about colorectal cancer screening. "
1590,1,"We measured self-reported changes in confidence and clinical practice patterns for counseling on colorectal cancer screening, and acceptability of the virtual-world learning environment and the MI instructional design. "
1591,1,Effectiveness of the MI training was assessed by coding and scoring tape-recorded interviews with a blinded mock patient conducted pre- and post-training.
1592,2,A total of 13 physicians completed the training. 
1593,2,Acceptability ratings for the MI training ranged from 4.1 to 4.7 on a 5-point scale. 
1594,2,"The SL learning environment was also highly rated, with 77% (n = 10) of the doctors reporting SL to be an effective educational medium. "
1595,2,Learners' confidence and clinical practice patterns for colorectal cancer screening improved after training. 
1596,2,"Pre- to post-training mean confidence scores for the ability to elicit and address barriers to colorectal cancer screening (4.5 to 6.2, P = .004) and knowledge of decision-making psychology (4.5 to 5.7, P = .02) and behavior change psychology (4.9 to 6.2, P = .02) increased significantly. "
1597,2,"Global MI skills scores increased significantly and component scores for the MI skills also increased, with statistically significant improvements in 4 of the 5 component skills: empathy (3.12 to 3.85, P = .001), autonomy (3.07 to 3.85, P < .001), collaboration (2.88 to 3.46, P = .02), and evocative response (2.80 to 3.61, P = .008)."
1598,3,The results of this pilot study suggest that virtual worlds offer the potential for a new medical education pedagogy that will enhance learning outcomes for patient-centered communication skills training.
1599,4,Older Adults with Multi-Morbidity: Medication Management Processes and Design Implications for Personal Health Applications
1600,0,Older adults often have multiple chronic problems requiring them to manage complex medication regimens overseen by various clinicians. 
1601,0,"Personal health applications (PHAs) show promise assisting in medication self-management, but adoption of new computer technologies by this population is challenging. "
1602,0,"Optimizing the utility of PHAs requires a thorough understanding of older adults' needs, preferences, and practices."
1603,1,We conducted a qualitative analysis of a series of individual and group semistructured interviews with participants who were identified through purposive sampling.
1604,2,We interviewed 32 adult patients and 2 adult family caregivers. 
1605,2,"We identified 5 core themes regarding medication self-management challenges: seeking reliable medication information, maintaining autonomy in medication treatment decisions, worrying about taking too many medications, reconciling information discrepancies between allopathic and alternative medical therapies, and tracking and coordinating health information between multiple providers."
1606,3,This study provides insights into the latent concerns and challenges faced by older adults and caregivers in managing medications. 
1607,3,"The results suggest that PHAs should have the following features to accommodate the management strategies and information preferences of this population: (1) provide links to authoritative and reliable information on side effects, drug interactions, and other medication-related concerns in a way that is clear, concise, and easy to navigate, (2) facilitate communication between patients and doctors and pharmacists through electronic messaging and health information exchange, and (3) provide patients the ability to selectively disclose medication information to different clinicians."
1608,4,"Patient and Parent Views on a Web 2.0 Diabetes Portal-the Management Tool, the Generator, and the Gatekeeper: Qualitative Study"
1609,0,"The Internet has undergone rapid development, with significant impact on social life and on modes of communication. "
1610,0,Modern management of type 1 diabetes requires that patients have access to continuous support and learning opportunities. 
1611,0,"Although Web 2.0 resources can provide this support, few pediatric clinics offer it as part of routine diabetes care."
1612,1,"Participants were 16 mothers, 3 fathers, and 5 young patients (ages 11-18 years; median 14 years) who each wrote an essay on their experience using the portal, irrespective of frequency and/or their success in using it. "
1613,1,Two main guiding questions were asked. 
1614,1,A qualitative content analysis was conducted of the essays as a whole.
1615,2,"Three main categories of portal users' attitudes were found; we named them ""the management tool,"" ""the generator,"" and ""the gatekeeper."" One category was related to the management tool functionality of the portal, and a wide range of concrete examples was found regarding useful facts and updates. "
1616,2,"Being enabled to search when necessary and find reliable information provided by local clinicians was regarded as a great advantage, facilitating a feeling of security and being in control. "
1617,2,"Finding answers to difficult-to-ask questions, questions portal users did not know they had before, and questions focusing on sensitive areas such as anxiety and fear, was also an important feature. "
1618,2,"A second category was related to the generator function in that visiting the portal could generate more information than expected, which could lead to increased use. "
1619,2,Active message boards and chat rooms were found to have great value for enhancing mediation of third party peer-to-peer information. 
1620,2,A certain level of active users from peer families and visible signs of their activity were considered necessary to attract returning users. 
1621,2,"A third category was related to the gatekeeper function of the password requirement, which created various access problems. "
1622,2,This and other unsuccessful experiences caused users to drop the portal. 
1623,2,"A largely open portal was suggested to enhance use by those associated with the child with diabetes, such as school personnel, relatives, friends and others, and also by young users somewhat unwilling to self-identify with the disease."
1624,3,Web 2.0 services have great potential for supporting parents and patients with type 1 diabetes by enhancing their information retrieval and disease management. 
1625,3,"Well-developed services, such as this one, may generate continued use and should, therefore, be carefully maintained and updated by health care professionals who are alert and active on the site with new information and updates. "
1626,3,Login procedures should be simple and minimized as much as possible. 
1627,3,The education of clinical practitioners regarding the use of Web 2.0 resources needs more attention.
1628,4,Providing Web-Based Feedback and Social Norms Information to Reduce Student Alcohol Intake: A Multisite Investigation
1629,0,"Unhealthy alcohol use among university students is cause for concern, yet the level of help seeking behavior for alcohol use is low within the student population. "
1630,0,Electronic brief interventions delivered via the Internet present an alternative to traditional treatments and could enable the delivery of interventions on a population basis. 
1631,0,Further evidence is needed of the effectiveness of Internet-delivered interventions and of their generalizability across educational institutions.
1632,1,"In total, 1112 participants took part. "
1633,1,"Participants were stratified by educational institution, gender, age group, year of study, and self-reported weekly consumption of alcohol and randomly assigned to either the control arm or to the immediate or delayed intervention arms. "
1634,1,"Intervention participants gained access to the intervention between weeks 1 to 7 or weeks 8 to 15, respectively. "
1635,1,The intervention provided electronic personalized feedback and social norms information on drinking behavior accessed by logging on to a website. 
1636,1,Participants registered interest by completing a brief screening questionnaire and were then asked to complete 4 further assessments across the 24 weeks of the study. 
1637,1,"Assessments included a retrospective weekly drinking diary, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and a readiness-to-change algorithm. "
1638,1,The outcome variable was the number of units of alcohol consumed in the last week. 
1639,1,The effect of treatment arm and time on units consumed last week and average units consumed per drinking occasion were investigated using repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). 
1640,1,"In addition, the data were modeled using a longitudinal regression with time points clustered within students."
1641,2,MANCOVA revealed a main effect of time on units of alcohol consumed over the last week. 
1642,2,A longitudinal regression model showed an effect of assessment across time predicting that participants who completed at least 2 assessments reduced their drinking. 
1643,2,"The model predicted an additional effect of being assigned to an intervention arm, an effect that increased across time. "
1644,2,Regression analysis predicted that being male or being assigned to an intervention arm increased the odds of not completing all assessments. 
1645,2,"The number of units of alcohol consumed over the last week at registration, age, university educational institution, and readiness to change were not predictive of completion."
1646,3,Delivering an electronic personalized feedback intervention to students via the Internet can be effective in reducing weekly alcohol consumption. 
1647,3,The effect does not appear to differ by educational institution. 
1648,3,Our model suggested that monitoring alone is likely to reduce weekly consumption over 24 weeks but that consumption could be further reduced by providing access to a Web-based intervention. 
1649,3,Further research is needed to understand the apparent therapeutic effect of monitoring and how this can be utilized to enhance the effectiveness of brief Web-based interventions.
1650,4,Health e-Cards as a Means of Encouraging Help Seeking for Depression Among Young Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial
1651,0,There is a need to identify interventions that increase help seeking for depression among young adults.
1652,1,A randomized controlled trial was carried out with 348 19- to 24-year-olds drawn from the community. 
1653,1,"Participants were randomized to receive one of three conditions, all of which delivered a short series of health e-cards. "
1654,1,Two active conditions involved the delivery of depression information designed to increase help-seeking behavior and intentions and to improve beliefs and knowledge associated with help seeking. 
1655,1,A control arm delivered information about general health issues unrelated to depression. 
1656,1,The primary outcome was help-seeking behavior. 
1657,1,Secondary outcomes were help-seeking intentions; beliefs about the efficacy of depression treatments and help sources; ability to recognize depression; knowledge of the help-seeking process; and depressive symptoms. 
1658,1,"The study's primary focus was outcomes relating to formal help seeking (consultation with a general practitioner or mental health professional) but also targeted behaviors, intentions, and beliefs relating to informal help seeking."
1659,2,"Relative to the control condition, depression health c-cards were not associated with an increase in formal help-seeking behavior, nor were they associated with improved beliefs about depression treatments; ability to recognize depression; knowledge of the help-seeking process; or depressive symptoms. "
1660,2,"Depression e-cards were associated with improved beliefs about the overall efficacy of formal help sources (z = 2.4, P=.02). "
1661,2,"At post-intervention, participants in all conditions, relative to pre-intervention, were more likely to have higher intentions of seeking help for depression from a formal help source (t(641) = 5.8, P < .001) and were more likely to rate interpersonal psychotherapy as being helpful (z = 2.0, P=.047). "
1662,2,"Depression c-cards were not associated with any significant changes in informal help-seeking behavior, intentions, or beliefs."
1663,3,The study found no evidence that providing depression information in the form of brief e-cards encourages help seeking for depression among young adults. 
1664,3,"Involvement in the study may have been associated with increased help-seeking intentions among participants in all conditions, suggesting that mechanisms other than depression information may increase help seeking."
1665,4,Health 2.0 and Medicine 2.0: Tensions and Controversies in the Field
1666,0,"The term Web 2.0 became popular following the O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 conference in 2004; however, there are difficulties in its application to health and medicine. "
1667,0,"Principally, the definition published by O'Reilly is criticized for being too amorphous, where other authors claim that Web 2.0 does not really exist. "
1668,0,"Despite this skepticism, the online community using Web 2.0 tools for health continues to grow, and the term Medicine 2.0 has entered popular nomenclature."
1669,1,"In the first phase, we employ a thematic analysis of online definitions, that is, the most important linked papers, websites, or blogs in the Medicine 2.0 community itself. "
1670,1,"In a second phase, this definition is then applied across a series of academic papers to review Medicine 2.0's core literature base, delineating it from a wider concept of eHealth."
1671,0,Provision of online evidence at the point of care is one strategy that could provide clinicians with easy access to up-to-date evidence in clinical settings in order to support evidence-based decision making.
1672,1,This was a prospective cohort study. 
1673,1,"59 clinicians who had a computer with Internet access in their consulting room participated in a 12-month trial of Quick Clinical, an online evidence system specifically designed around the needs of general practitioners (GPs). "
1674,1,Patterns of use were determined by examination of computer logs and survey analysis.
1675,0,Mental illness is an escalating concern worldwide. 
1676,0,The management of disorders such as anxiety and depression largely falls to family doctors or general practitioners (GPs). 
1677,0,"However, GPs are often too time constrained and may lack the necessary training to adequately manage the needs of such patients. "
1678,0,"Evidence-based Internet interventions represent a potentially valuable resource to reduce the burden of care and the cost of managing mental health disorders within primary care settings and, at the same tithe, improve patient outcomes."
1679,1,"Via a natural groups design, 96 people with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) completed the Panic Online program over 12 weeks with the therapeutic assistance of their GP (n = 53), who had received specialist training in cognitive behavioral therapy, or a clinical psychologist (n = 43). "
1680,1,"Participants completed a clinical diagnostic telephone interview, conducted by a psychologist, and a set of online questionnaires to assess panic-related symptoms at three time periods (pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6 month follow-up)."
1681,2,Both treatments led to clinically significant improvements on measures of panic and panic-related symptomatology from pretreatment to posttreatment. 
1682,2,Both groups were shown to significantly improve over time. 
1683,2,"Improvements for both groups were maintained at follow-up; however, the groups did differ significantly on two quality of life domains: physical (F(1.82) = 9.13, P =.00) and environmental (F(1.82) = 4.41, P =.04). "
1684,2,"The attrition rate was significantly higher among those being treated by their GP (chi(2)(1) = 4.40, P =.02, N = 96)."
1685,3,This study provides evidence that Internet-based interventions are an effective adjunct to existing mental health care systems. 
1686,3,"Consequently, this may facilitate and enhance the delivery of evidence-based mental health treatments to increasingly large segments of the population via primary care systems and through suitably trained health professionals."
1687,1,We analyzed referrals to the Swinfen Charitable Trust between July 2004 and June 2007 and compared these by speciality with those received from elsewhere during the same 3-year period. 
1688,1,"We asked two referring doctors for their views of the process, and we analyzed the total Middle Eastern referrals made to a single specialty (neurology)."
1689,2,"Between July 2004 and June 2007, 283 referrals were received from four countries in the Middle East (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kuwait) and 500 cases were received from 22 other countries. "
1690,2,The 283 cases resulted in 522 separate queries to specialists. 
1691,2,The median time to specialist reply for the queries relating to the 283 Middle Eastern cases was 24.3 hours (interquartile range 6.1-63.3). 
1692,2,"There was a significant difference in case mix between the Middle East and the rest of the world (P <.001), with more obstetric referrals and fewer referrals in medical specialties and radiology. "
1693,2,The referring doctors were helped greatly by the service. 
1694,2,The neurologist was confident of the diagnosis in 20 of 26 referrals received (77%). 
1695,2,Both referring doctors and the specialist were able to cite referred cases where management was improved as a result of the service.
1696,3,Email telemedicine can be used in areas of conflict such as the Middle East. 
1697,3,"Perhaps surprisingly, trauma referrals are not increased but obstetric referrals are. "
1698,3,Supporting individual doctor-patient encounters in this way is therefore often beneficial and is easily expandable. 
1699,3,"As well as improving care for individuals, email telemedicine provides effective case-based learning for local doctors, leading to improved care for subsequent similar patients."
1700,1,"Participants included 607 men and women aged 18 and over residing in Minnesota who self-reported current tobacco use when registering for an Internet-based tobacco cessation program between February 2 and April 13, 2004. "
1701,1,"Participants were given access to an interactive website with features including social support, expert systems, proactive email, chat sessions, and online counselors. "
1702,1,Mixed-mode follow-up (online survey with telephone survey for online nonrespondents) occurred 6 months after registration.
1703,2,"Of the study participants, 77.6% (471/607) responded to the 6-month follow-up survey (39.4% online and 38.2% by telephone). "
1704,2,"Among respondents, 17.0% (80/471, 95% CI = 13.6%-20.4%) reported that they had not smoked in the past 7 days (observed rate). "
1705,2,"Assuming all nonresponaents were still smoking (missing =smoking rate), the quit rate was 13.2% (80/607, 95% CI = 10.5%-15.9%)."
1706,3,This mixed-mode follow-up survey of an online smoking cessation program achieved a high response rate and provides a more accurate estimate of long-term cessation rates than has been previously reported. 
1707,3,Quit rates for the Internet-based tobacco cessation program were higher than those expected for unassisted quit attempts and are comparable to other evidence-based behavioral interventions. 
1708,3,"The similarities between quit rates demonstrates that an Internet-based cessation program may have as great an impact as, and can have wider reach than, other cessation programs such as those delivered by telephone. "
1709,3,"With over 100000 people having visited the website and over 23000 having registered, a 6-month self-reported quit rate of 13.2% suggests that the quitplan.com program helped over 3000 Minnesotans remain tobacco free for at least 6 months. "
1710,3,Results of this study suggest that an Internet-based cessation program is a useful tool in states' efforts to provide comprehensive cessation tools for smokers.
1711,4,Vaccine criticism on the World Wide Web
1712,0,The incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases is directly related to the number of unvaccinated children. 
1713,0,Parents who refuse vaccination of their children frequently express concerns about vaccine safety. 
1714,0,The Internet can influence perceptions about vaccines because it is the fastest growing source of consumer health information. 
1715,0,"However, few studies have analyzed vaccine criticism on the Web."
1716,1,"A structured Web search was conducted for the terms ""vaccine,"" ""vaccination,"" ""vaccinate:"" and ""anti-vaccination"" using a metasearch program that incorporated 8 search engines. "
1717,1,This yielded 1138 Web pages representing 750 sites. 
1718,1,"Two researchers reviewed the sites for inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting in 78 vaccine-critical sites, which were then abstracted for design, content, and allegations."
1719,2,"The most common characteristic of vaccine-critical websites was the inclusion of statements linking vaccinations with specific adverse reactions, especially idiopathic chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, autism, and diabetes. "
1720,2,"Other common attributes (>= 70% of websites) were links to other vaccine-critical websites; charges that vaccines contain contaminants, mercury, or ""hot lots"" that cause adverse events; claims that vaccines provide only temporary protection and that the diseases prevented are mild; appeals for responsible parenting through education and resisting the establishment; allegations of conspiracies and cover-ups to hide the truth about vaccine safety; and charges that civil liberties are violated through mandatory vaccination."
1721,3,Vaccine-critical websites frequently make serious allegations. 
1722,3,"With the burgeoning of the Internet as a health information source, an undiscerning or incompletely educated public may accept these claims and refuse vaccination of their children. "
1723,3,"As this occurs, the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases can be expected to rise."
1724,4,What is eHealth (5): A research agenda for eHealth through stakeholder consultation and policy context review
1725,0,"In 2003, the National Health Service in England and Wales, despite its large investment in information and communication technology, had not set a national research agenda. "
1726,0,"The National Health Service has three main research and development programs: one is the Service Delivery and Organisation program, commissioned in 2003, and the others are two parallel ""scoping exercises"" to help set a research agenda. "
1727,0,This paper reports on one of those projects. 
1728,0,A parallel literature review was carried out by others and has been reported elsewhere.
1729,1,There were two parallel strands. 
1730,1,"For the stakeholder consultation, 37 professionals representing 12 ""stakeholder"" groups participated in focus groups or interviews. "
1731,1,"Discussion was prompted by eHealth ""scenarios"" and analyzed using thematic content analysis. "
1732,1,"Subsequently, 17 lay participants, in three focus groups, discussed and prioritized these themes. "
1733,1,"For the policy review, 26 policy makers were interviewed, and 95 policy documents were reviewed. "
1734,1,Recommendations were subsequently reviewed in a conference workshop. 
1735,1,Recommendations for research from both strands were combined into a conceptual map.
1736,2,Themes from stakeholder consultation and policy review were combined as 43 recommendations under six headings. 
1737,2,"Four of these headings (using, processing, sharing, and controlling information) describe the scope of eHealth research. "
1738,2,"The other two relate to how research should be carried out (ensuring best practice is first identified and disseminated) and to the values considered important by stakeholders (in particular, measuring improvement in health)."
1739,3,"The scope of eHealth research (using, processing, sharing, controlling information) derived empirically from this study corresponds with ""textbook"" descriptions of informatics. "
1740,3,"Stakeholders would like eHealth research to include outcomes such as improved health or quality of life, but such research may be long term while changes in information technology are rapid. "
1741,3,"Longer-term research questions need to be concerned with human behavior and our use of information, rather than particular technologies. "
1742,3,"In some cases, ""modelling"" longer-term costs and benefits (in terms of health) may be desirable."
1743,4,Searching for Cancer Information on the Internet: Analyzing Natural Language Search Queries
1744,0,Searching for health information is one of the most-common tasks performed by Internet users. 
1745,0,Many users begin searching on popular search engines rather than on prominent health information sites. 
1746,0,"We know that many visitors to our (National Cancer Institute) Web site, cancer. "
1747,0,"gov, arrive via links in search engine result."
1748,1,"The National Cancer Institute partnered with AskJeeves, Inc to develop a methodology to capture, sample, and analyze 3 months of cancer-related queries on the Ask.com Web site, a prominent United States consumer search engine, which receives over 35 million queries per week. "
1749,1,"Using a benchmark set of 500 terms and word roots supplied by the National Cancer Institute, AskJeeves identified a test sample of cancer queries for 1 week in August 2001. "
1750,1,From these 500 terms only 37 appeared >= 5 times/day over the trial test week in 17208 queries. 
1751,1,"Using these 37 terms, 204165 instances of cancer queries were found in the Ask.com query logs for the actual test period of June-August 2001. "
1752,1,"Of these, 7500 individual user questions were randomly selected for detailed analysis and assigned to appropriate categories. "
1753,1,The exact language of sample queries is presented.
1754,2,"Considering multiples of the same questions, the sample of 7500 individual user queries represented 76077 queries (37% of the total 3-month pool). "
1755,2,Overall 78.37% of sampled Cancer queries asked about 14 specific cancer types. 
1756,2,"Within each cancer type, queries were sorted into appropriate subcategories including at least the following: General Information, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Testing, Treatment, Statistics, Definition, and Cause/Risk/Link. "
1757,2,"The most-common specific cancer types mentioned in queries were Digestive/Gastrointestinal/Bowel (15.0%), Breast (11.7%), Skin (11.3%), and Genitourinary (10.5%). "
1758,2,"Additional subcategories of queries about specific cancer types varied, depending on user input. "
1759,2,Queries that were not specific to a cancer type were also tracked and categorized.
1760,3,Natural-language searching affords users the opportunity to fully express their information needs and can aid users naive to the content and vocabulary. 
1761,3,The specific queries analyzed for this study reflect news and research studies reported during the study dates and would surely change with different study dates. 
1762,3,Analyzing queries from search engines represents one way of knowing what kinds of content to provide to users of a given Web site. 
1763,3,"Users ask questions using whole sentences and keywords, often misspelling words. "
1764,3,"Providing the option for natural-language searching does not obviate the need for good information architecture, usability engineering, and user testing in order to optimize user experience."
1765,4,"Trusted Online Sources of Health Information: Differences in Demographics, Health Beliefs, and Health-Information Orientation"
1766,0,The recent surge in online health information and consumer use of such information has led to expert speculations and prescriptions about the credibility of health information on the World Wide Web. 
1767,0,"In spite of the growing concern over online health information sources, existing research reveals a lacuna in the realm of consumer evaluations of trustworthiness of different health information sources on the Internet."
1768,1,"The Porter Novelli HealthStyles database, collected annually since 1995, is based on the results of nationally-representative postal-mail surveys. "
1769,1,"In 1999, 2636 respondents provided usable data for the HealthStyles database. "
1770,1,"Independent sample t tests were conducted to compare the respondents in the realm of demographic, attitudinal, and cognitive variables."
1771,2,"The most trusted sources of online health information included the personal doctor, medical university, and federal government. "
1772,2,"The results demonstrated significant differences in demographic and health-oriented variables when respondents who trusted a particular online source were compared with respondents that did not trust the source, suggesting the need for a segmented approach to research and application. "
1773,2,"Individuals trusting the local doctor were younger (t(2634)= 4.02, P<.001) and held stronger health beliefs (F (1)= 5.65, P= .018); individuals trusting the local hospital were less educated (t(2634)= 3.83, P<.001), low health information oriented (F (1)= 6.41, P= .011), and held weaker health beliefs (F (1)= 5.56, P= .018). "
1774,2,"Respondents with greater trust in health insurance companies as online health information sources were less educated (t(2634)= 1.90, P= .05) and less health information oriented (F (1)= 4.30, P= .04). "
1775,2,"Trust in medical universities was positively associated with education (t2634= 11.83, P<.001), income (t(2634)= 10.19, P<.001), and health information orientation (F (1)= 10.32, P<.001). "
1776,2,"Similar results were observed in the realm of federal information credibility, with individuals with greater trust in federal sources being more educated (t(2634)= 7.45, P<.001) and health information oriented (F (1)= 4.45, P= .04) than their counterparts."
1777,3,The results suggest systematic differences in the consumer segment based on the different sources of health information trusted by the consumer. 
1778,3,"While certain sources such as the local hospital and the health insurance company might serve as credible sources of health information for the lower socioeconomic and less health-oriented consumer segment, sources such as medical universities and federal Web sites might serve as trustworthy sources for the higher socioeconomic and more health-oriented groups."
1779,4,Experiences of Using Digital Mindfulness-Based Interventions: Rapid Scoping Review and Thematic Synthesis
1780,0,Digital mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are a promising approach to deliver accessible and scalable mindfulness training and have been shown to improve a range of health outcomes. 
1781,0,"However, the success of digital MBIs is reliant on adequate engagement, which remains a crucial challenge. "
1782,0,Understanding people's experiences of using digital MBIs and identifying the core factors that facilitate or act as barriers to engagement is essential to inform intervention development and maximize engagement and outcomes.
1783,1,We conducted a scoping review to synthesize empirical qualitative research on people's experiences of using digital MBIs. 
1784,1,We adopted a streamlined approach to ensure that the evidence could be incorporated into the early stages of intervention development. 
1785,1,"The search strategy identified articles with at least one keyword related to mindfulness, digital, user experience, and psychosocial variables in their title or abstract. "
1786,1,"Inclusion criteria specified that articles must have a qualitative component, report on participants' experiences of using a digital MBI designed to improve psychosocial variables, and have a sample age range that at least partially overlapped with 16 to 35 years. "
1787,1,Qualitative data on user experience were charted and analyzed using inductive thematic synthesis to generate understandings that go beyond the content of the original studies. 
1788,1,We used the Quality of Reporting Tool to critically appraise the included sources of evidence.
1789,2,"The search identified 510 studies, 22 (4.3%) of which met the inclusion criteria. "
1790,2,"Overall, the samples were approximately 78% female and 79% White; participants were aged between 16 and 69 years; and the most used measures in intervention studies were mindfulness, psychological flexibility, and variables related to mental health (including depression, anxiety, stress, and well-being). "
1791,2,All studies were judged to be adequately reported. 
1792,2,"We identified 3 themes characterizing barriers to and facilitators of engagement: responses to own practice (ie, negative reactions to one's own practice are common and can deplete motivation), making mindfulness a habit (ie, creating a consistent training routine is essential yet challenging), and leaning on others (ie, those engaging depend on someone else for support)."
1793,3,The themes identified in this review provide crucial insights as to why people frequently stop engaging with digital MBIs. 
1794,3,"Researchers and developers should consider using person-based coparticipatory methods to improve acceptability of and engagement with digital MBIs, increase their effectiveness, and support their translation to real-world use. "
1795,3,Such strategies must be grounded in relevant literature and meet the priorities and needs of the individuals who will use the interventions.
1796,4,"Experiences of Diagnosis, Symptoms, and Use of Reliever Inhalers in Patients With Asthma and Concurrent Inducible Laryngeal Obstruction or Breathing Pattern Disorder: Qualitative Analysis of a UK Asthma Online Community"
1797,0,"Breathing pattern disorders (BPDs) and inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) cause similar symptoms to asthma, including dyspnea and chest tightness, with an estimated prevalence of up to one-fifth of patients with asthma. "
1798,0,"Both conditions can be comorbid with asthma, and there is evidence that they are misdiagnosed and mistreated as asthma."
1799,1,A qualitative thematic analysis was performed with posts from an asthma community between 2018 and 2022. 
1800,1,A list of key ILO or BPD symptoms was created from the literature. 
1801,1,"Posts were identified using the search terms ""blue inhaler"" and ""breath"" and included if describing key symptoms. "
1802,1,Discussion threads of included posts were also analyzed.
1803,2,The search retrieved a total of 1127 relevant posts: 1069 written by 302 users and 58 posted anonymously. 
1804,2,"All participants were adults, except 2 who were parents writing about their children. "
1805,2,"Sex and age were only available for 1.66% (5/302; 3 females and 2 males) and 9.93% (30/302) of participants (27 to 73 years old), respectively. "
1806,2,The average number of posts written by each participant was 3.54 (range 1-63). 
1807,2,Seven participants wrote >20 posts each. 
1808,2,"Participants experiencing undiagnosed ILO or BPD symptoms, whether or not comorbid with asthma, expressed frustration with the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to diagnosis, as many felt that their asthma diagnosis did not fully explain symptoms. "
1809,2,"Some suspected or were formally diagnosed with BPD or ILO, the latter reporting relief on receiving a diagnosis and appropriate management. "
1810,2,Participants showed awareness of their inappropriate salbutamol use or overuse due to lack of effect on symptoms. 
1811,2,BPD and ILO symptoms were frequently comorbid with asthma. 
1812,2,The asthma online community was a valuable resource: engagement with peers not only brought comfort but also prompted action with some going back to their clinicians and reaching a diagnosis and appropriate management.
1813,3,"Undiagnosed ILO and BPD symptoms and lack of effects of asthma treatment were topics of discussion in an asthma online community, caused distress and frustration in participants, and affected their relationship with health care professionals, showing that patients experiencing BPD and ILO have unmet needs. "
1814,3,"Clinicians' education on BPD and ILO diagnosis and management, as well as increased access to appropriate management options, such as respiratory physiotherapy and speech and language therapy, are warranted particularly in primary care. "
1815,3,Qualitative evidence that engagement with the online community resulted in patients taking action going back to their clinicians and reaching a diagnosis of ILO and BPD prompts future research on online peer support from an established online health community as a self-management resource for patients.
1816,4,Association Between Online Health Information-Seeking Behaviors by Caregivers and Delays in Pediatric Cancer: Mixed Methods Study in China
1817,0,Pediatric cancer patients in China often present at an advanced stage of disease resulting in lower survival and poorer health outcomes. 
1818,0,One factor hypothesized to contribute to delays in pediatric cancer has been the online health information-seeking (OHIS) behaviors by caregivers.
1819,1,"This study used a mixed methods approach, specifically a sequential explanatory design. "
1820,1,OHIS behavior by the caregiver was defined as the way caregivers access information relevant to their children's health via the Internet. 
1821,1,"Delays in pediatric cancer were defined as any one of the following 3 types of delay: patient delay, diagnosis delay, or treatment delay. "
1822,1,"The quantitative analysis methods included descriptive analyses, Student t tests, Pearson chi-square test, and binary logistic regression analysis, all performed using Stata. "
1823,1,The qualitative analysis methods included conceptual content analysis and the Colaizzi method.
1824,2,"A total of 303 pediatric cancer patient-caregiver dyads was included in the quantitative survey, and 29 caregivers completed the qualitative interview. "
1825,2,"Quantitative analysis results revealed that nearly one-half (151/303, 49.8%) of patients experienced delays in pediatric cancer, and the primary type of delay was diagnosis delay (113/303, 37.3%), followed by patient delay (50/303, 16.5%) and treatment delay (24/303, 7.9%). "
1826,2,"In this study, 232 of the 303 (76.6%) caregiver participants demonstrated OHIS behaviors. "
1827,2,"When those engaged in OHIS behaviors were compared with their counterparts, the likelihood of patient delay more than doubled (odds ratio=2.21; 95% CI 1.03-4.75). "
1828,2,Qualitative analysis results showed that caregivers' OHIS behaviors impacted the cancer care pathway by influencing caregivers' symptom appraisal before the first medical contact and caregivers' acceptance of health care providers' diagnostic and treatment decisions.
1829,3,Our findings suggest that OHIS among Chinese pediatric caregivers may be a risk factor for increasing the likelihood of patient delay. 
1830,3,Our government and society should make a concerted effort to regulate online health information and improve its quality. 
1831,3,Specialized freemium consultations provided by health care providers via online health informatic platforms are needed to shorten the time for caregivers' cancer symptom appraisal before the first medical contact.
1832,4,Topics in Antivax and Provax Discourse: Yearlong Synoptic Study of COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets
1833,0,Developing an understanding of the public discourse on COVID-19 vaccination on social media is important not only for addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic but also for future pathogen outbreaks. 
1834,0,"There are various research efforts in this domain, although, a need still exists for a comprehensive topic-wise analysis of tweets in favor of and against COVID-19 vaccines."
1835,1,We examined a Twitter data set containing 75 million English tweets discussing the COVID-19 vaccination from March 2020 to March 2021. 
1836,1,We trained a stance detection algorithm using natural language processing techniques to classify tweets as antivax or provax and examined the main topics of discourse using topic modeling techniques.
1837,2,"Provax tweets (37 million) far outnumbered antivax tweets (10 million) and focused mostly on vaccine development, whereas antivax tweets covered a wide range of topics, including opposition to vaccine mandate and concerns about safety. "
1838,2,"Although some antivax tweets included genuine concerns, there was a large amount of falsehood. "
1839,2,Both stances discussed many of the same topics from opposite viewpoints. 
1840,2,Memes and jokes were among the most retweeted messages. 
1841,2,"Most tweets from both stances (9,007,481/10,566,679, 85.24% antivax and 24,463,708/37,044,507, 66.03% provax tweets) came from dual-stance users who posted both provax and antivax tweets during the observation period."
1842,3,This study is a comprehensive account of COVID-19 vaccine discourse in the English language on Twitter from March 2020 to March 2021. 
1843,3,"The broad range of discussion points covered almost the entire conversation, and their temporal dynamics revealed a significant correlation with COVID-19 vaccine-related events. "
1844,3,We did not find any evidence of polarization and prevalence of antivax discourse over Twitter. 
1845,3,"However, targeted countering of falsehoods is important because only a small fraction of antivax discourse touched on a genuine issue. "
1846,3,Future research should examine the role of memes and humor in driving web-based social media activity.
1847,4,Mindfulness-Based Mobile Apps and Their Impact on Well-Being in Nonclinical Populations: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
1848,0,Mindfulness-based mobile apps have become popular tools for enhancing well-being in today's fast-paced world. 
1849,0,"Their ability to reduce geographical, financial, and social barriers makes them a promising alternative to traditional interventions."
1850,1,"A systematic literature search was conducted using PsycInfo, PsycNet, PubMed, an institutional search engine (u:search), and Google Scholar. "
1851,1,Randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of mobile mindfulness apps on well-being in nonclinical samples were included. 
1852,1,"Study selection, risk of bias (using the version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials), and reporting quality (using selected CONSORT [Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials] statement criteria) assessments were performed by 2 authors independently and discussed until a consensus was reached."
1853,2,"The 28 included randomized controlled trials differed in well-being measures, apps, and intervention duration (7 to 56 days; median duration 28 days). "
1854,2,A wide range of sample sizes (12 to 2282; median 161) and attrition rates (0% to 84.7%; median rate 23.4%) were observed. 
1855,2,"Most studies (19/28, 68%) reported positive effects on at least one aspect of well-being. "
1856,2,The effects were presented using different metrics but were primarily small or small to medium in size. 
1857,2,Overall risk of bias was mostly high.
1858,3,"The wide range of sample sizes, attrition rates, and intervention periods and the variation in well-being measures and mobile apps contributed to the limited comparability of the studies. "
1859,3,"Although most studies (16/28, 57%) reported small or small to medium effects for at least one well-being outcome, this review demonstrates that the generalizability of the results is limited. "
1860,3,Further research is needed to obtain more consistent conclusions regarding the impact of mindfulness-based mobile apps on well-being in nonclinical populations.
1861,4,The Minimum Data Set for Rare Diseases: Systematic Review
1862,0,The minimum data set (MDS) is a collection of data elements to be grouped using a standard approach to allow the use of data for clinical and research purposes. 
1863,0,"Health data are typically voluminous, complex, and sometimes too ambiguous to generate indicators that can provide knowledge and information on health. "
1864,0,This complexity extends further to the rare disease (RD) domain. 
1865,0,MDSs are essential for health surveillance as they help provide services and generate recommended population indicators. 
1866,0,"There is a bottleneck in international literature that reveals a global problem with data collection, recording, and structuring in RD."
1867,1,"The population, concept, and context methodology proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute was used to define the research question of this systematic review. "
1868,1,"A total of 4 databases were reviewed, and all the processes were reported using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. "
1869,1,"The data elements were analyzed, extracted, and organized into 10 categories according to WHO digital health guidelines. "
1870,1,The quality assessment used the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist.
1871,2,"We included 20 studies in our review, 70% (n=14) of which focused on a specific health domain and 30% (n=6) of which referred to RD in general. "
1872,2,"WHO recommends that health systems and networks use standard terminology to exchange data, information, knowledge, and intelligence in health. "
1873,2,"However, there was a lack of terminological standardization of the concepts in MDSs. "
1874,2,"Moreover, the selected studies did not follow the same standard structure for classifying the data from their MDSs. "
1875,2,"All studies presented MDSs with limitations or restrictions because they covered only a specific RD, or their scope of application was restricted to a specific context or geographic region. "
1876,2,"Data science methods and clinical experience were used to design, structure, and recommend a fundamental global MDS for RD patient records in health care networks."
1877,3,Our study highlights the difficulties in standardizing and categorizing findings from MDSs for RD because of the varying structures used in different studies. 
1878,3,The fundamental RD MDS designed in this study comprehensively covers the data needs in the clinical and management sectors. 
1879,3,These results can help public policy makers support other aspects of their policies. 
1880,3,We highlight the potential of our results to help strategic decisions related to RD.
1881,4,Using Virtual Emergency Medicine Clinicians as a Health System Entry Point (Virtual First): Cross-Sectional Survey Study
1882,0,"The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transition in health care, which required a rapid adaptation for stakeholders. "
1883,0,Telemedicine has emerged as an ideal tool to ensure continuity of care by allowing remote access to specialized medical services. 
1884,0,"However, its rapid implementation has exacerbated disparities in health care access, especially for the most susceptible populations."
1885,1,We conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. 
1886,1,"A total of 4 databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register) were searched for empirical studies published between January 3, 2020, and December 31, 2021, using established criteria. "
1887,1,The protocol of this review was registered and published in PROSPERO (CRD42022302825). 
1888,1,"A methodological quality assessment was performed, and the results were integrated into a thematic synthesis. "
1889,1,The identification of the main opportunities and challenges was done by interpreting and aggregating the thematic synthesis results.
1890,2,"Of the 106 studies identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria and the intended quality characteristics. "
1891,2,All studies were originally from the United States. 
1892,2,The following facilitating factors of telemedicine use were identified: health insurance coverage; prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection; access to internet services; access to technological devices; better management of work-life balance; and savings in travel costs. 
1893,2,We identified the following barriers to telemedicine use: lack of access to internet services; lack of access to technological devices; racial and ethnic disparities; low digital literacy; low income; age; language barriers; health insurance coverage; concerns about data privacy and confidentiality; geographic disparities; and the need for complementary diagnostic tests or the delivery of test results.
1894,3,"The facilitating factors and barriers identified in this systematic review present different opportunities and challenges, including those of a technological nature (access to technological devices and internet services and level of digital literacy), a sociocultural and demographic nature (ethnic and racial disparities, geographic disparities, language barriers, and age), a socioeconomic nature (income level and health insurance coverage), and an ethical and legal nature (data privacy and confidentiality). "
1895,4,Barriers and Facilitators to Implementing a Digital Adherence Technology for Tuberculosis Treatment Supervision in Uganda: Qualitative Study
1896,0,Ensuring the completion of treatment for tuberculosis (TB) remains a key challenge in many high-burden countries. 
1897,0,99DOTS is a low-cost digital adherence technology that has emerged as a promising tool for monitoring and supporting TB treatment completion.
1898,1,"Between April 1 and August 31, 2021, we conducted in-depth interviews with people with TB and key informant interviews with health workers and district and regional TB officers involved in the implementation of 99DOTS at 18 health facilities in Uganda. "
1899,1,"Semistructured interview guides were informed by the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior (COM-B) model and explored perceptions of, and experiences with, 99DOTS, including barriers and facilitators to its use."
1900,2,"Interviews were conducted with 30 people with TB, 12 health workers, and 7 TB officers. "
1901,2,"All people with TB, health workers, and TB officers noted that 99DOTS supported and encouraged people with TB to take their anti-TB medication, facilitated treatment monitoring, and improved relationships between people with TB and health workers. "
1902,2,"Participants also liked that the platform was free, easy to use, and improved TB treatment outcomes. "
1903,2,"Barriers to 99DOTS implementation for some people with TB were related to limited literacy, including technology literacy; limited access to electricity to charge their mobile phone to make dosing confirmation calls; and poor network connection. "
1904,2,Gender differences in 99DOTS uptake also emerged. 
1905,2,"Specifically, women with TB were described to be more concerned that 99DOTS use would expose them to TB stigma and to be more likely to have mobile phone-access issues than men with TB. "
1906,2,"By contrast, men with TB not only had access to mobile phones but also received substantial support from their female partners to take their anti-TB medication and make 99DOTS dosing confirmation calls. "
1907,2,"Finally, although women with TB were described to face more barriers to 99DOTS use than men with TB, the women's"
1908,3,"Overall, 99DOTS seems to be a feasible and acceptable strategy to support anti-TB medication adherence in Uganda. "
1909,3,"However, access to mobile phones, inability to charge mobile phones, and concerns about stigma should be considered and addressed as part of programmatic implementation to maximize uptake among all people with TB, particularly women and those with fewer financial resources."
1910,4,Evaluating the Supporting Evidence of Medical Cannabis Claims Made on Clinic Websites: Cross-Sectional Study
1911,0,"Since the legalization of medical cannabis in Canada in 2013, prescription of cannabis for medical purposes has become commonplace and a multibillion dollar industry has formed. "
1912,0,"Much of the media coverage surrounding medical cannabis has been positive in nature, leading to Canadians potentially underestimating the adverse effects of medical cannabis use. "
1913,0,"In recent years, there has been a large increase in clinic websites advertising the use of medical cannabis for health indications. "
1914,0,"However, little is known about the quality of the evidence used by these clinic websites to describe the effectiveness of cannabis used for medical purposes."
1915,1,"We conducted a cross-sectional web search to identify all cannabis clinic websites within Ontario, Canada, that had physician involvement and identified their primary purpose as cannabis prescription. "
1916,1,Two reviewers independently searched these websites to identify all medical indications for which cannabis was promoted and reviewed and critically appraised all studies cited using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence rubric.
1917,2,"A total of 29 clinics were identified, promoting cannabis for 20 different medical indications including migraines, insomnia, and fibromyalgia. "
1918,2,There were 235 unique studies cited on these websites to support the effectiveness of cannabis for these indications. 
1919,2,"A high proportion (36/235, 15.3%) of the studies were identified to be at the lowest level of evidence (level 5). "
1920,2,Only 4 clinic websites included any mention of harms associated with cannabis.
1921,3,Cannabis clinic websites generally promote cannabis use as medically effective but cite low-quality evidence to support these claims and rarely discuss harms. 
1922,3,The recommendation of cannabis as a general therapeutic for many indications unsupported by high-quality evidence is potentially misleading for medical practitioners and patients. 
1923,3,This disparity should be carefully evaluated in context of the specific medical indication and an individualized patient risk assessment. 
1924,3,Our work illustrates the need to increase the quality of research performed on the medical effects of cannabis.
1925,4,"The Effects of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Suicidal Ideation or Behaviors on Depression, Anxiety, and Hopelessness in Individuals With Suicidal Ideation: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Individual Participant Data"
1926,0,Suicide is a global public health problem. 
1927,0,Digital interventions are considered a low-threshold treatment option for people with suicidal ideation or behaviors. 
1928,0,Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) targeting suicidal ideation has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation. 
1929,0,"However, suicidal ideation often is related to additional mental health problems, which should be addressed for optimal care. "
1930,0,"Yet, the effects of iCBT on related symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and hopelessness, remain unclear."
1931,1,"We systematically searched CENTRAL, PsycInfo, Embase, and PubMed for randomized controlled trials that investigated guided or unguided iCBT for suicidal ideation or behaviors. "
1932,1,Participants reporting baseline suicidal ideation were eligible. 
1933,1,Individual participant data (IPD) were collected from eligible trials. 
1934,1,"We conducted a 1-stage IPD meta-analysis on the effects on depression, anxiety, and hopelessness-analyzed as 2 indices: symptom severity and treatment response."
1935,2,We included IPD from 8 out of 9 eligible trials comprising 1980 participants with suicidal ideation. 
1936,2,"iCBT was associated with significant reductions in depression severity (b=-0.17; 95% CI -0.25 to -0.09; P<.001) and higher treatment response (ie, 50% reduction of depressive symptoms; b=0.36; 95% CI 0.12-0.60; P=.008) after treatment. "
1937,2,We did not find significant effects on anxiety and hopelessness.
1938,3,iCBT for people with suicidal ideation revealed significant effects on depression outcomes but only minor or no effects on anxiety and hopelessness. 
1939,3,"Therefore, individuals with comorbid symptoms of anxiety or hopelessness may require additional treatment components to optimize care. "
1940,3,Studies that monitor symptoms with higher temporal resolution and consider a broader spectrum of factors influencing suicidal ideation are needed to understand the complex interaction of suicidality and related mental health symptoms.
1941,4,Development and Assessment of a Social Media-Based Construct of Firearm Ownership: Computational Derivation and Benchmark Comparison
1942,0,Gun violence research is characterized by a dearth of data available for measuring key constructs. 
1943,0,"Social media data may offer a potential opportunity to significantly reduce that gap, but developing methods for deriving firearms-related constructs from social media data and understanding the measurement properties of such constructs are critical precursors to their broader use."
1944,1,We used survey responses to questions on firearm ownership linked with Twitter data to construct different machine learning models of firearm ownership. 
1945,1,We externally validated these models using a set of firearm-related tweets hand-curated from the Twitter Streaming application programming interface and created state-level ownership estimates using a sample of users collected from the Twitter Decahose application programming interface. 
1946,1,We assessed the criterion validity of state-level estimates by comparing their geographic variance to benchmark measures from the RAND State-Level Firearm Ownership Database.
1947,2,We found that the logistic regression classifier for gun ownership performs the best with an accuracy of 0.7 and an F1-score of 0.69. 
1948,2,We also found a strong positive correlation between Twitter-based estimates of gun ownership and benchmark ownership estimates. 
1949,2,"For states meeting a threshold requirement of a minimum of 100 labeled Twitter users, the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are 0.63 (P<.001) and 0.64 (P<.001), respectively."
1950,3,Our success in developing a machine learning model of firearm ownership at the individual level with limited training data as well as a state-level construct that achieves a high level of criterion validity underscores the potential of social media data for advancing gun violence research. 
1951,3,"The ownership construct is an important precursor for understanding the representativeness of and variability in outcomes that have been the focus of social media analyses in gun violence research to date, such as attitudes, opinions, policy stances, sentiments, and perspectives on gun violence and gun policy. "
1952,3,"The high criterion validity we achieved for state-level gun ownership suggests that social media data may be a useful complement to traditional sources of information on gun ownership such as survey and administrative data, especially for identifying early signals of changes in geographic patterns of gun ownership, given the immediacy of the availability of social media data, their continuous generation, and their responsiveness. "
1953,3,"These results also lend support to the possibility that other computationally derived, social media-based constructs may be derivable, which could lend additional insight into firearm behaviors that are currently not well understood. "
1954,3,More work is needed to develop other firearms-related constructs and to assess their measurement properties.
1955,4,The Effectiveness of Online-Only Blended Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training: Static-Group Comparison Study
1956,0,"Basic life support (BLS) education is essential for improving bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rates, but the imparting of such education faces obstacles during the outbreak of emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. "
1957,0,"When face-to-face teaching is limited, distance learning-blended learning (BL) or an online-only model-is encouraged. "
1958,0,"However, evidence regarding the effect of online-only CPR training is scarce, and comparative studies on classroom-based BL (CBL) are lacking. "
1959,0,"While other strategies have recommended self-directed learning and deliberate practice to enhance CPR education, no previous studies have incorporated all of these instructional methods into a BLS course."
1960,1,A static-group comparison study was conducted. 
1961,1,"It included RBL and CBL courses that shared the same paradigm, comprising online lectures, a deliberate practice session with Little Anne quality CPR (QCPR) manikin feedback, and a final assessment session. "
1962,1,"In the main intervention, the RBL group was required to perform distant self-directed deliberate practice and complete the final assessment via an online video conference. "
1963,1,Manikin-rated CPR scores were measured as the primary outcome; the number of retakes of the final examination was the secondary outcome.
1964,2,"A total of 52 and 104 participants from the RBL and CBL groups, respectively, were eligible for data analysis. "
1965,2,"A comparison of the 2 groups revealed that there were more women in the RBL group than the CBL group (36/52, 69.2% vs 51/104, 49%, respectively; P=.02). "
1966,2,"After adjustment, there were no significant differences in scores for QCPR release (96.9 vs 96.4, respectively; P=.61), QCPR depth (99.2 vs 99.5, respectively; P=.27), or QCPR rate (94.9 vs 95.5, respectively; P=.83). "
1967,2,"The RBL group spent more days practicing before the final assessment (12.4 vs 8.9 days, respectively; P<.001) and also had a higher number of retakes (1.4 vs 1.1 times, respectively; P<.001)."
1968,3,We developed a remote practice BL-based method for online-only distant BLS CPR training. 
1969,3,"In terms of CPR performance, using remote self-directed deliberate practice was not inferior to the conventional classroom-based instructor-led method, although it tended to take more time to achieve the same effect."
1970,4,Twitters Role in Combating the Magnetic Vaccine Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis of Tweets
1971,0,The popularity of the magnetic vaccine conspiracy theory and other conspiracy theories of a similar nature creates challenges to promoting vaccines and disseminating accurate health information.
1972,1,"A total of 18,706 tweets were retrieved and analyzed by using social network analysis. "
1973,1,"Data were retrieved from June 1 to June 13, 2021, using the keyword vaccine magnetic. "
1974,1,Tweets were retrieved via a dedicated Twitter application programming interface. 
1975,1,"More specifically, the Academic Track application programming interface was used, and the data were analyzed by using NodeXL Pro (Social Media Research Foundation) and Gephi."
1976,2,"There were a total of 22,762 connections between Twitter users within the data set. "
1977,2,This study found that the most influential user within the network consisted of a news account that was reporting on the magnetic vaccine conspiracy. 
1978,2,"There were also several other users that became influential, such as an epidemiologist, a health economist, and a retired sports athlete who exerted their social capital within the network."
1979,3,"Our study found that influential users were effective broadcasters against the conspiracy, and their reach extended beyond their own networks of Twitter followers. "
1980,3,"We emphasize the need for trust in influential users with regard to health information, particularly in the context of the widespread social uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, when public sentiment on social media may be unpredictable. "
1981,3,This study highlights the potential of influential users to disrupt information flows of conspiracy theories via their unique social capital.
1982,4,Evaluating the Ability of Open-Source Artificial Intelligence to Predict Accepting-Journal Impact Factor and Eigenfactor Score Using Academic Article Abstracts: Cross-sectional Machine Learning Analysis
1983,0,Strategies to improve the selection of appropriate target journals may reduce delays in disseminating research results. 
1984,0,Machine learning is increasingly used in content-based recommender algorithms to guide journal submissions for academic articles.
1985,1,"PubMed-indexed articles published between 2016 and 2021 were identified with the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms ""ophthalmology,"" ""radiology,"" and ""neurology."" Journals, titles, abstracts, author lists, and MeSH terms were collected. "
1986,1,Journal impact factor and Eigenfactor scores were sourced from the 2020 Clarivate Journal Citation Report. 
1987,1,"The journals included in the study were allocated percentile ranks based on impact factor and Eigenfactor scores, compared with other journals that released publications in the same year. "
1988,1,"All abstracts were preprocessed, which included the removal of the abstract structure, and combined with titles, authors, and MeSH terms as a single input. "
1989,1,The input data underwent preprocessing with the inbuilt ktrain Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) preprocessing library before analysis with BERT. 
1990,1,"Before use for logistic regression and XGBoost models, the input data underwent punctuation removal, negation detection, stemming, and conversion into a term frequency-inverse document frequency array. "
1991,1,"Following this preprocessing, data were randomly split into training and testing data sets with a 3:1 train:test ratio. "
1992,1,"Models were developed to predict whether a given article would be published in a first, second, or third tertile journal (0-33rd centile, 34th-66th centile, or 67th-100th centile), as ranked either by impact factor or Eigenfactor score. "
1993,1,"BERT, XGBoost, and logistic regression models were developed on the training data set before evaluation on the hold-out test data set. "
1994,1,The primary outcome was overall classification accuracy for the best-performing model in the prediction of accepting journal impact factor tertile.
1995,2,"There were 10,813 articles from 382 unique journals. "
1996,2,"The median impact factor and Eigenfactor score were 2.117 (IQR 1.102-2.622) and 0.00247 (IQR 0.00105-0.03), respectively. "
1997,2,"The BERT model achieved the highest impact factor tertile classification accuracy of 75.0%, followed by an accuracy of 71.6% for XGBoost and 65.4% for logistic regression. "
1998,2,"Similarly, BERT achieved the highest Eigenfactor score tertile classification accuracy of 73.6%, followed by an accuracy of 71.8% for XGBoost and 65.3% for logistic regression."
1999,3,Open-source artificial intelligence can predict the impact factor and Eigenfactor score of accepting peer-reviewed journals. 
2000,3,Further studies are required to examine the effect on publication success and the time-to-publication of such recommender systems.
2001,4,Machine Learning for Predicting Micro- and Macrovascular Complications in Individuals With Prediabetes or Diabetes: Retrospective Cohort Study
2002,0,Micro-and macrovascular complications are a major burden for individuals with diabetes and can already arise in a prediabetic state. 
2003,0,"To allocate effective treatments and to possibly prevent these complications, identification of those at risk is essential."
2004,1,"In this study, we used electronic health records from Israel that contain information about demographics, biomarkers, medications, and disease codes; span from 2003 to 2013; and were queried to identify individuals with prediabetes or diabetes in 2008. "
2005,1,"Subsequently, we aimed to predict which of these individuals developed a micro-or macrovascular complication within the next 5 years. "
2006,1,"We included 3 microvascular complications: retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. "
2007,1,"In addition, we considered 3 macrovascular complications: peripheral vascular disease (PVD), cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD). "
2008,1,"Complications were identified via disease codes, and, for nephropathy, the estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria were considered additionally. "
2009,1,Inclusion criteria were complete information on age and sex and on disease codes (or measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria for nephropathy) until 2013 to account for patient dropout. 
2010,1,Exclusion criteria for predicting a complication were diagnosis of this specific complication before or in 2008. 
2011,1,"In total, 105 predictors from demographics, biomarkers, medications, and disease codes were used to build the ML models. "
2012,1,We compared 2 ML models: logistic regression and gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs). 
2013,1,"To explain the predictions of the GBDTs, we calculated Shapley additive explanations values."
2014,2,"Overall, 13,904 and 4259 individuals with prediabetes and diabetes, respectively, were identified in our underlying data set. "
2015,2,"For individuals with prediabetes, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for logistic regression and GBDTs were, respectively, 0.657 and 0.681 (retinopathy), 0.807 and 0.815 (nephropathy), 0.727 and 0.706 (neuropathy), 0.730 and 0.727 (PVD), 0.687 and 0.693 (CeVD), and 0.707 and 0.705 (CVD); for individuals with diabetes, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were, respectively, 0.673 and 0.726 (retinopathy), 0.763 and 0.775 (nephropathy), 0.745 and 0.771 (neuropathy), 0.698 and 0.715 (PVD), 0.651 and 0.646 (CeVD), and 0.686 and 0.680 (CVD). "
2016,2,"Overall, the prediction performance is comparable for logistic regression and GBDTs. "
2017,2,"The Shapley additive explanations values showed that increased levels of blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and serum creatinine are risk factors for microvascular complications. "
2018,2,Age and hypertension were associated with an elevated risk for macrovascular complications.
2019,3,Our ML models allow for an identification of individuals with prediabetes or diabetes who are at increased risk of developing micro-or macrovascular complications. 
2020,3,The prediction performance varied across complications and target populations but was in an acceptable range for most prediction tasks.
2021,4,Patient Perspectives and Preferences for Consent in the Digital Health Context: State-of-the-art Literature Review
2022,0,The increasing integration of digital health tools into care may result in a greater flow of personal health information (PHI) between patients and providers. 
2023,0,"Although privacy legislation governs how entities may collect, use, or share PHI, such legislation has not kept pace with digital health innovations, resulting in a lack of guidance on implementing meaningful consent. "
2024,0,Understanding patient perspectives when implementing meaningful consent is critical to ensure that it meets their needs. 
2025,0,Consent for research in the context of digital health is limited.
2026,1,"A structured literature search was developed and deployed in 4 electronic databases-MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science-for articles published after January 2010. "
2027,1,The initial literature search was conducted in March 2021 and updated in March 2022. 
2028,1,"Articles were eligible for inclusion if they discussed electronic consent or consent, focused on the patient perspective or preference, and were related to digital health or digital PHI. "
2029,1,Data were extracted using an extraction template and analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
2030,2,"In total, 75 articles were included for analysis. "
2031,2,"Most studies were published within the last 5 years (58/75, 77%) and conducted in a clinical care context (33/75, 44%) and in the United States (48/75, 64%). "
2032,2,"Most studies aimed to understand participants' willingness to share PHI (25/75, 33%) and participants' perceived usability and comprehension of an electronic consent notice (25/75, 33%). "
2033,2,"More than half (40/75, 53%) of the studies did not describe the type of consent model used. "
2034,2,"The broad open consent model was the most explored (11/75, 15%). "
2035,2,"Of the 75 studies, 68 (91%) found that participants were willing to provide consent; however, their consent behaviors and preferences were context-dependent. "
2036,2,"Common patient consent requirements included clear and digestible information detailing who can access PHI, for what purpose their PHI will be used, and how privacy will be ensured."
2037,3,There is growing interest in understanding the patient perspective on digital health consent in the context of providing clinical care. 
2038,3,"There is evidence suggesting that many patients are willing to consent for various purposes, especially when there is greater transparency on how the PHI is used and oversight mechanisms are in place. "
2039,3,Providing this transparency is critical for fostering trust in digital health tools and the innovative uses of data to optimize health and system outcomes.
2040,4,Quality of Information in Gallstone Disease Videos on TikTok: Cross-sectional Study
2041,0,TikTok was an important channel for consumers to access and adopt health information. 
2042,0,But the quality of health content in TikTok remains underinvestigated.
2043,1,"We investigated the first 100 gallstone-related videos on TikTok and analyzed these videos' upload sources, content, and characteristics. "
2044,1,"The quality of videos was evaluated using quantitative scoring tools such as DISCERN instrument, the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria, and Global Quality Scores (GQS). "
2045,1,"Moreover, the correlation between video quality and video characteristics, including duration, likes, comments, and shares, was further investigated."
2046,2,"According to video sources, 81% of the videos were posted by doctors. "
2047,2,"Furthermore, disease knowledge was the most dominant video content, accounting for 56% of all the videos. "
2048,2,"The mean DISCERN, JAMA, and GQS scores of all 100 videos are 39.61 (SD 11.36), 2.00 (SD 0.40), and 2.76 (SD 0.95), respectively. "
2049,2,"According to DISCERN and GQS, gallstone-related videos' quality score on TikTok is not high, mainly at fair (43/100, 43%,) and moderate (46/100, 46%). "
2050,2,"The total DISCERN scores of doctors were significantly higher than that of individuals and news agencies, surgery techniques were significantly higher than lifestyle and news, and disease knowledge was significantly higher than news, respectively. "
2051,2,DISCERN scores and video duration were positively correlated. 
2052,2,Negative correlations were found between DISCERN scores and likes and shares of videos. 
2053,2,"In GQS analysis, no significant differences were found between groups based on different sources or different contents. "
2054,2,JAMA was excluded in the video quality and correlation analysis due to a lack of discrimination and inability to evaluate the video quality accurately.
2055,3,"Although the videos of gallstones on TikTok are mainly provided by doctors and contain disease knowledge, they are of low quality. "
2056,3,We found a positive correlation between video duration and video quality. 
2057,3,"High-quality videos received low attention, and popular videos were of low quality. "
2058,3,Medical information on TikTok is currently not rigorous enough to guide patients to make accurate judgments. 
2059,3,TikTok was not an appropriate source of knowledge to educate patients due to the low quality and reliability of the information.
2060,4,Setting up a Governance Framework for Secondary Use of Routine Health Data in Nursing Homes: Development Study Using Qualitative Interviews
2061,0,"In the nursing home sector, reusing routinely recorded data from electronic health records (EHRs) for knowledge development and quality improvement is still in its infancy. "
2062,0,Trust in appropriate and responsible reuse is crucial for patients and nursing homes deciding whether to share EHR data for these purposes. 
2063,0,"A data governance framework determines who may access the data, under what conditions, and for what purposes. "
2064,0,This can help obtain that trust. 
2065,0,"Although increasing attention is being paid to data governance in the health care sector, little guidance is available on development and implementation of a data governance framework in practice."
2066,1,"Relevant stakeholders representing practices, policies, and research in the nursing home sector were identified. "
2067,1,Semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 people from 14 stakeholder organizations. 
2068,1,"The main aim of the interviews was to explore stakeholders' perspectives regarding the Registry's aim, data access criteria, and governing bodies' tasks and composition. "
2069,1,"Interview topics and analyses were guided by 8 principles regarding governance for reusing health data, as described in the literature. "
2070,1,"Interview results, together with legal advice and consensus discussions by the Registry's consortium partners, were used to shape the rules, regulations, and governing bodies of the governance framework."
2071,2,"Stakeholders valued the involvement of nursing home residents and their representatives, nursing home physicians, nursing homes' boards of directors, and scientists and saw this as a prerequisite for a trustworthy data governance framework. "
2072,2,"For the Registry, involvement of these groups can be achieved through a procedure in which residents can provide their consent or objection to the reuse of the data, transparency about the decisions made, and providing them a position in a governing body. "
2073,2,"In addition, a data request approval procedure based on predefined assessment criteria indicates that data reuse by third parties aligns with the aims of the Registry, benefits the nursing home sector, and protects the privacy of data subjects."
2074,3,"The stakeholders' views, expertise, and knowledge of other frameworks and relevant legislation serve to inform the application of governance principles to the contexts of both the nursing home sector and the Netherlands. "
2075,3,Many different stakeholders were involved in the development of the Registry Learning from Data in Nursing Homes' governance framework and will continue to be involved. 
2076,3,Engagement of the full range of stakeholders in an early stage of governance framework development is important to generate trust in appropriate and responsible data reuse.
2077,4,"Analyzing User-Generated Web-Based Posts of Adolescents Emotional, Behavioral, and Symptom Responses to Beliefs About Depression: Qualitative Thematic Analysis"
2078,0,Depression is common during adolescence. 
2079,0,Early intervention can prevent it from developing into more progressive mental disorders. 
2080,0,Combining information technology and clinical psychoeducation is a promising way to intervene at an earlier stage. 
2081,0,"However, data-driven research on the cognitive response to health information targeting adolescents with symptoms of depression is lacking."
2082,1,The data set consists of 1870 depression-related questions posted by adolescents on a public web-based information service. 
2083,1,Most of the posts contain descriptions of events that lead to depression. 
2084,1,"On a sample of 100 posts, we conducted a qualitative thematic analysis based on cognitive behavioral theory investigating behavioral, emotional, and symptom responses to beliefs associated with depression."
2085,2,Results were organized into four themes. 
2086,2,"(1) Hopelessness, appearing as a set of negative beliefs about the future, possibly results from erroneous beliefs about the causal link between risk factors and the course of depression. "
2087,2,We found beliefs about establishing a sturdy therapy alliance as a responsibility resting on the patient. 
2088,2,(2) Therapy hesitancy seemed to be associated with negative beliefs about therapy prognosis and doubts about confidentiality. 
2089,2,(3) Social shame appeared as a consequence of impaired daily function when the cause is not acknowledged. 
2090,2,(4) Failing to attain social interaction appeared to be associated with a negative symptom response. 
2091,2,"In contrast, actively obtaining social support reduces symptoms and suicidal thoughts."
2092,3,"These results could be used to meet the clinical aims stated by earlier psychoeducation development, such as instilling hope through direct reattribution of beliefs about the future; challenging causal attributions, thereby lowering therapy hesitancy; reducing shame through the mechanisms of externalization by providing a tentative diagnosis despite the risk of stigmatizing; and providing initial symptom relief by giving advice on how to open up and reveal themselves to friends and family and balance the message of self-management to fit coping capabilities. "
2093,3,"An active counseling style advises the patient to approach the social environment, demonstrating an attitude toward self-action."
2094,4,Consumer-Generated Discourse on Cannabis as a Medicine: Scoping Review of Techniques
2095,0,Medicinal cannabis is increasingly being used for a variety of physical and mental health conditions. 
2096,0,"Social media and web-based health platforms provide valuable, real-time, and cost-effective surveillance resources for gleaning insights regarding individuals who use cannabis for medicinal purposes. "
2097,0,This is particularly important considering that the evidence for the optimal use of medicinal cannabis is still emerging. 
2098,0,"Despite the web-based marketing of medicinal cannabis to consumers, currently, there is no robust regulatory framework to measure clinical health benefits or individual experiences of adverse events. "
2099,0,"In a previous study, we conducted a systematic scoping review of studies that contained themes of the medicinal use of cannabis and used data from social media and search engine results. "
2100,0,This study analyzed the methodological approaches and limitations of these studies.
2101,1,"We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases for primary studies in the English language from January 1974 to April 2022. "
2102,1,Studies were included if they aimed to understand web-based user-generated text related to health conditions where cannabis is used as a medicine or where health was mentioned in general cannabis-related conversations.
2103,2,We included 42 articles in this review. 
2104,2,"In these articles, Twitter was used 3 times more than other computer-generated sources, including Reddit, web-based forums, GoFundMe, YouTube, and Google Trends. "
2105,2,"Analytical methods included sentiment assessment, thematic analysis (manual and automatic), social network analysis, and geographic analysis."
2106,3,This study is the first to review techniques used by research on consumer-generated text for understanding cannabis as a medicine. 
2107,3,It is increasingly evident that consumer-generated data offer opportunities for a greater understanding of individual behavior and population health outcomes. 
2108,3,"However, research using these data has some limitations that include difficulties in establishing sample representativeness and a lack of methodological best practices. "
2109,3,"To address these limitations, deidentified annotated data sources should be made publicly available, researchers should determine the origins of posts (organizations, bots, power users, or ordinary individuals), and powerful analytical techniques should be used."
2110,4,A Smartphone App to Promote Patient Activation and Support Shared Decision-making in People With a Diagnosis of Schizophrenia in Outpatient Treatment Settings (Momentum Trial): Randomized Controlled Assessor-Blinded Trial
2111,0,Shared decision-making (SDM) is a process aimed at facilitating patient-centered care by ensuring that the patient and provider are actively involved in treatment decisions. 
2112,0,"In mental health care, SDM has been advocated as a means for the patient to gain or regain control and responsibility over their life and recovery process. "
2113,0,"To support the process of patient-centered care and SDM, digital tools may have advantages in terms of accessibility, structure, and reminders."
2114,1,"The trial was designed as a randomized, assessor-blinded, 2-armed, parallel-group multicenter trial investigating the use of a digital SDM intervention for 6 months compared with treatment as usual. "
2115,1,"Participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorder were recruited from 9 outpatient treatment sites in the Capital Region of Denmark. "
2116,1,The primary outcome was the self-reported level of activation at the postintervention time point. 
2117,1,"The secondary outcomes included self-efficacy, hope, working alliance, satisfaction, preparedness for treatment consultation, symptom severity, and level of functioning. "
2118,1,Explorative outcomes on the effect of the intervention at the midintervention time point along with objective data on the use of the digital tool were collected.
2119,2,"In total, 194 participants were included. "
2120,2,"The intention-to-treat analysis revealed a statistically significant effect favoring the intervention group on patient activation (mean difference 4.39, 95% CI 0.99-7.79; Cohen d=0.33; P=.01), confidence in communicating with one's provider (mean difference 1.85, 95% CI 0.01-3.69; Cohen d=0.24; P=.05), and feeling prepared for decision-making (mean difference 5.12, 95% CI 0.16-10.08; Cohen d=0.27; P=.04). "
2121,2,"We found no effect of the digital SDM tool on treatment satisfaction, hope, self-efficacy, working alliance, severity of symptoms, level of functioning, use of antipsychotic medicine, and number or length of psychiatric hospital admissions."
2122,3,"This trial showed a significant effect of a digital SDM tool on the subjective level of patient activation, confidence in communicating with one's provider, and feeling prepared for decision-making at the postintervention time point. "
2123,3,The effect size was smaller than the 0.42 effect size that we had anticipated and sampled for. 
2124,3,The trial contributes to the evidence on how digital tools may support patient-centered care and SDM in mental health care.
2125,4,Quality and Audience Engagement of Takotsubo Syndrome-Related Videos on TikTok: Content Analysis
2126,0,"The incidence of Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as the broken heart syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy, is increasing worldwide. "
2127,0,"The understanding of its prognosis has been progressively evolving and currently appears to be poorer than previously thought, which has attracted the attention of researchers. "
2128,0,"An attempt to recognize the awareness of this condition among the general population drove us to analyze the dissemination of this topic on TikTok, a popular short-video-based social media platform. "
2129,0,"We found a considerable number of videos on TTS on TikTok; however, the quality of the presented information remains unknown."
2130,1,"Videos on the TikTok platform were explored on August 2, 2021 to identify those related to TTS by using 6 Chinese keywords. "
2131,1,"A total of 2549 videos were found, of which 80 met our inclusion criteria and were evaluated for their characteristics, content, quality, and reliability. "
2132,1,"The quality and reliability were rated using the DISCERN instrument and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) criteria by 2 reviewers independently, and a score was assigned. "
2133,1,"Descriptive statistics were generated, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis. "
2134,1,"Multiple linear regression was performed to evaluate the association between audience engagement and other factors such as video content, video quality, and author types."
2135,2,The scores assigned to the selected video content were low with regard to the diagnosis (0.66/2) and management (0.34/2) of TTS. 
2136,2,The evaluated videos were found to have an average score of 36.93 out of 80 on the DISCERN instrument and 1.51 out of 4 per the JAMA criteria. 
2137,2,None of the evaluated videos met all the JAMA criteria. 
2138,2,The quality of the relayed information varied by source (All P<.05). 
2139,2,TTS-related videos made by health care professionals accounted for 28% (22/80) of all the evaluated videos and had the highest DISCERN scores with an average of 40.59 out of 80. 
2140,2,"Multiple linear regression analysis showed that author types that identified as health professionals (exponentiated regression coefficient 17.48, 95% CI 2.29-133.52; P=.006) and individual science communicators (exponentiated regression coefficient 13.38, 95% CI 1.83-97.88; P=.01) were significant and independent determinants of audience engagement (in terms of the number of likes). "
2141,2,"Other author types of videos, video content, and DISCERN document scores were not associated with higher likes."
2142,3,We found that the quality of videos regarding TTS for patient education on TikTok is poor. 
2143,3,Patients should be cautious about health-related information on TikTok. 
2144,4,Effectiveness of eHealth Self-management Interventions in Patients With Heart Failure: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
2145,0,"Heart failure (HF) is a common clinical syndrome associated with substantial morbidity, a heavy economic burden, and high risk of readmission. "
2146,0,eHealth self-management interventions may be an effective way to improve HF clinical outcomes.
2147,1,"This study included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of eHealth interventions with usual care in adult patients with HF using searches of the EMBASE, PubMed, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and CINAHL databases from January 1, 2011, to July 12, 2022. "
2148,1,The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2) was used to assess the risk of bias for each study. 
2149,1,"The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were used to rate the certainty of the evidence for each outcome of interest. "
2150,1,Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager (RevMan v.5.4) and R (v.4.1.0 x64) software.
2151,2,"In total, 24 RCTs with 9634 participants met the inclusion criteria. "
2152,2,"Compared with the usual-care group, eHealth self-management interventions could significantly reduce all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.98, P=.03; GRADE: low quality) and cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.92, P=.008; GRADE: moderate quality), as well as all-cause readmissions (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.93, P=.002; GRADE: low quality) and HF-related readmissions (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.90, P<.001; GRADE: moderate quality). "
2153,2,"The meta-analyses also showed that eHealth interventions could increase patients' knowledge of HF and improve their quality of life, but there were no statistically significant effects. "
2154,2,"However, eHealth interventions could significantly increase medication adherence (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.42-2.34, P<.001; GRADE: low quality) and improve self-care behaviors (standardized mean difference -1.34, 95% CI -2.46 to -0.22, P=.02; GRADE: very low quality). "
2155,2,A subgroup analysis of primary outcomes regarding the enrolled population setting found that eHealth interventions were more effective in patients with HF after discharge compared with those in the ambulatory clinic setting.
2156,3,eHealth self-management interventions could benefit the health of patients with HF in various ways. 
2157,3,"However, the clinical effects of eHealth interventions in patients with HF are affected by multiple aspects, and more high-quality studies are needed to demonstrate effectiveness."
2158,4,Factors Influencing How Providers Assess the Appropriateness of Video Visits: Interview Study With Primary and Specialty Health Care Providers
2159,0,"The rapid implementation of virtual care (ie, telephone or video-based clinic appointments) during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in many providers offering virtual care with little or no formal training and without clinical guidelines and tools to assist with decision-making As new guidelines for virtual care provision take shape, it is critical that they are informed by an in-depth understanding of how providers make decisions about virtual care in their clinical practices."
2160,1,We conducted semistructured interviews with 28 purposefully selected primary and specialty health care providers from the US Department of Veteran's Affairs health care system. 
2161,1,We used an inductive approach to identify factors that impact provider decision-making.
2162,2,"Qualitative analysis revealed distinct clinical, patient, and provider factors that influence provider decisions to initiate or continue with virtual visits. "
2163,2,"Clinical factors include patient acuity, the need for additional tests or labs, changes in patients' health status, and whether the patient is new or has no recent visit. "
2164,2,"Patient factors include patients' ability to articulate symptoms or needs, availability and accessibility of technology, preferences for or against virtual visits, and access to caregiver assistance. "
2165,2,Provider factors include provider comfort with and acceptance of virtual technology as well as virtual physical exam skills and training.
2166,3,Providers within the US Department of Veterans Affairs health administration system consider a complex set of factors when deciding whether to offer or continue a video or telephone visit. 
2167,3,"These factors can inform the development and further refinement of decision tools, guides, and other policies to ensure that virtual care expands access to high-quality care."
2168,4,"The Effect of Tailored, Daily, Smartphone Feedback to Lifestyle Self-Monitoring on Weight Loss at 12 Months: the SMARTER Randomized Clinical Trial"
2169,0,"Self-monitoring (SM) is the centerpiece of behavioral weight loss treatment, but the efficacy of smartphone-delivered SM feedback (FB) has not been tested in large, long-term, randomized trials."
2170,1,"All participants received a 90-minute, one-to-one, in-person behavioral weight loss counseling session addressing behavioral strategies, establishing participants' dietary and PA goals, and instructing on use of the PA tracker (Fitbit Charge 2), smart scale, and diet SM app. "
2171,1,"Only SM+FB participants had access to an investigator-developed smartphone app that read SM data, in which an algorithm selected tailored messages sent to the smartphone up to 3 times daily. "
2172,1,The SM-only participants did not receive any tailored FB based on SM data. 
2173,1,The primary outcome was percent weight change from baseline to 12 months. 
2174,1,"Secondary outcomes included engagement with digital tools (eg, monthly percentage of FB messages opened and monthly percentage of days adherent to the calorie goal)."
2175,2,Participants (N=502) were on average 45.0 (SD 14.4) years old with a mean BMI of 33.7 (SD 4.0) kg/m(2). 
2176,2,The sample was 79.5% female (n=399/502) and 82.5% White (n=414/502). 
2177,2,"At 12 months, retention was 78.5% (n=394/502) and similar by group (SM+FB: 202/251, 80.5%; SM: 192/251, 76.5%; P=.28). "
2178,2,"There was significant percent weight loss from baseline in both groups (SM+FB: -2.12%, 95% CI -3.04% to -1.21%, P<.001; SM: -2.39%, 95% CI -3.32% to -1.47%; P<.001), but no difference between the groups (-0.27%; 95% CI -1.57% to 1.03%; t =-0.41; P=.68). "
2179,2,"Similarly, 26.3% (66/251) of the SM+FB group and 29.1% (73/251) of the SM group achieved >= 5% weight loss (chi-square value=0.49; P=.49). "
2180,2,A 1% increase in FB messages opened was associated with a 0.10 greater percent weight loss at 12 months (b=0.10; 95% CI -0.13 to -0.07; t =-5.90; P<.001). 
2181,2,A 1% increase in FB messages opened was associated with 0.12 greater percentage of days adherent to the calorie goal per month (b=0.12; 95% CI 0.07-0.17; F=22.19; P<.001).
2182,3,"There were no significant between-group differences in weight loss; however, the findings suggested that the use of commercially available digital SM tools with or without FB resulted in a clinically significant weight loss in over 25% of participants. "
2183,3,Future studies need to test additional strategies that will promote greater engagement with digital tools.
2184,4,Evaluation of Web-Based Health Information From the Perspective of Women With Eating Disorders: Thematic Analysis
2185,0,"Users with experience of eating disorders use the internet as a source of information, whether for prorecovery activities (such as web-based treatment, looking for information, support, and sharing) or activities that promote eating disorder behavior as a desirable lifestyle choice (such as pro-eating disorder communities and reading and creating pro-eating disorder posts). "
2186,0,Their assessment of web-based eating disorder-related information is crucial for understanding the context of the illness and for health professionals and their web-based interventions.
2187,1,We analyzed 30 semistructured individual interviews with Czech women aged 16 to 28 years with past or present eating disorder experience using a qualitative approach. 
2188,1,Thematic analysis was adopted as an analytical tool.
2189,2,The specifics of eating disorder phases (the disorder stage and the treatment process) emerged as important aspects in the process of information assessment. 
2190,2,"Other specific characteristics of respondents (eg, motivation, abilities, and resources) addressed how the respondents arrived at certain web-based information and how they evaluated it. "
2191,2,"In addition, the respondents described some content cues as features of information (eg, novelty and social information pooling). "
2192,2,"Another finding is that other users' attitudes, experiences, activities, and personal features are involved in the information evaluation of these users and the information presented by them. "
2193,2,"Finally, the respondents evaluated the websites' visual look and graphic components."
2194,3,This study shows that web-based information evaluation reported by women with experience of eating disorders is a complex process. 
2195,3,"The assessment is influenced by current personal characteristics related to the illness (mainly the motivation for maintaining or curing the eating disorder) using cues associated with information content, other users, and website look. "
2196,3,"The study findings have important implications for health professionals, who should ask their clients questions about web-based communities and their needs to understand what information and sources they choose."
2197,4,The Development and Evaluation of an e-Learning Course That Promotes Digital Health Literacy in School-age Children: Pre-Post Measurement Study
2198,0,Experts agree that the promotion of (digital) health literacy should be an integral part of the school curriculum. 
2199,0,"However, promoting (digital) health literacy within the German school system is difficult because (digital) health education is not a mandatory school subject in all the German states. "
2200,0,"Therefore, experts suggest that (digital) health literacy could be addressed as part of the mandatory framework for digital education and digital literacy in schools developed by the German Conference on Education Ministries and Cultural Affairs (Kultusministerkonferenz)."
2201,1,The pre-post measurement study was conducted online. 
2202,1,"After participants (N=323) gave their informed consent to participate in the study, they provided demographic information and answered all measures (premeasurement). "
2203,1,"Following this, participants had 7 days to complete the e-learning course. "
2204,1,"After finishing the e-learning course, participants answered all the measures again (postmeasurement)."
2205,2,"To test the hypotheses, Bayesian paired samples t tests (1-sided) were conducted. "
2206,2,"After completing the e-learning course, participants showed higher health literacy levels. "
2207,2,"Specifically, they showed higher competency levels in the domains of theoretical knowledge (Bayes factor [BF](-0)=676,000; delta=-0.316), practical knowledge (BF-0=92,300; delta=-0.294), critical thinking (BF-0=7.42e+13; delta=-0.482), self-awareness (BF-0=11,500,000; delta=-0.345), and citizenship (BF-0=266,000; delta=-0.306). "
2208,2,"Furthermore, participants achieved higher digital health literacy levels. "
2209,2,"Specifically, they achieved higher competency levels in the domains of information searching (BF-0=2.339; delta=-0.135), evaluating reliability (BF-0=2.03e+11; delta=-0.434), and determining relevance (BF-0=316,000; delta=-0.308). "
2210,2,"Moreover, participants demonstrated higher subjective (BF-0=3.58e+82; delta=-1.515) and objective knowledge (BF-0=3.82e+97; delta=-1.758) in the domain of (digital) health literacy."
2211,3,The newly designed e-learning course provides an easy way for schools and teachers from all German states to integrate (digital) health literacy education into their school curriculums and lessons. 
2212,3,The evaluated course is especially attractive because it was designed to improve (digital) health literacy and at the same time to teach skills specified in the mandatory framework for digital education and digital literacy in schools developed by the German Conference on Education Ministries and Cultural Affairs (Kultusministerkonferenz).
2213,4,Contributions of Artificial Intelligence Reported in Obstetrics and Gynecology Journals: Systematic Review
2214,0,The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) processes have grown significantly in all medical disciplines during the last decades. 
2215,0,"Two main types of AI have been applied in medicine: symbolic AI (eg, knowledge base and ontologies) and nonsymbolic AI (eg, machine learning and artificial neural networks). "
2216,0,"Consequently, AI has also been applied across most obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) domains, including general obstetrics, gynecology surgery, fetal ultrasound, and assisted reproductive medicine, among others."
2217,1,"The PubMed database was searched for citations indexed with ""artificial intelligence"" and at least one of the following medical subject heading (MeSH) terms between January 1, 2000, and April 30, 2020: ""obstetrics""; ""gynecology""; ""reproductive techniques, assisted""; or ""pregnancy."" All publications in OB/GYN core disciplines journals were considered. "
2218,1,The selection of journals was based on disciplines defined in Web of Science. 
2219,1,The publications were excluded if no AI process was used in the study. 
2220,1,"Review, editorial, and commentary articles were also excluded. "
2221,1,"The study analysis comprised (1) classification of publications into OB/GYN domains, (2) description of AI methods, (3) description of AI algorithms, (4) description of data sets, (5) description of AI contributions, and (6) description of the validation of the AI process."
2222,2,The PubMed search retrieved 579 citations and 66 publications met the selection criteria. 
2223,2,"All OB/GYN subdomains were covered: obstetrics (41%, 27/66), gynecology (3%, 2/66), assisted reproductive medicine (33%, 22/66), early pregnancy (2%, 1/66), and fetal medicine (21%, 14/66). "
2224,2,Both machine learning methods (39/66) and knowledge base methods (25/66) were represented. 
2225,2,"Machine learning used imaging, numerical, and clinical data sets. "
2226,2,Knowledge base methods used mostly omics data sets. 
2227,2,"The actual contributions of AI were method/algorithm development (53%, 35/66), hypothesis generation (42%, 28/66), or software development (3%, 2/66). "
2228,2,"Validation was performed on one data set (86%, 57/66) and no external validation was reported. "
2229,2,We observed a general rising trend in publications related to AI in OB/GYN over the last two decades. 
2230,2,"Most of these publications (82%, 54/66) remain out of the scope of the usual OB/GYN journals."
2231,3,"In OB/GYN discipline journals, mostly preliminary work (eg, proof-of-concept algorithm or method) in AI applied to this discipline is reported and clinical validation remains an unmet prerequisite. "
2232,3,Improvement driven by new AI research guidelines is expected. 
2233,3,"However, these guidelines are covering only a part of AI approaches (nonsymbolic) reported in this review; hence, updates need to be considered."
2234,4,Frequency and Correlates of Online Consultations With Doctors or Therapists in Middle-Aged and Older Adults: Nationally Representative Cross-sectional Study
2235,0,A few studies have identified the frequency and correlates of online consultations with doctors or therapists. 
2236,0,"However, there is a lack of studies using nationally representative data from middle-aged and older adults in Germany."
2237,1,"For this study, cross-sectional data were taken from the nationally representative German Ageing Survey (DEAS; n=3067 in the analytical sample; age range 46-98 years). "
2238,1,"As part of the DEAS, a short survey was conducted between June 8 and July 22, 2020, examining the everyday life and living conditions among these middle-aged and older individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. "
2239,1,"The frequency of online consultations with doctors or therapists served as the dependent variable (daily, several times a week, once a week, 1-3 times a month, less often, and never). "
2240,1,Multiple logistic regressions were performed.
2241,2,"In sum, 10.02% (381/3806) of individuals with access to the internet had online consultations with doctors or therapists. "
2242,2,"Multiple logistic regressions showed that the likelihood of using online consultations with doctors or therapists (compared with those never using such services) was positively associated with higher education (compared with medium education; odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.70), living with a partner in the same household (compared with single; OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.05-2.22), poorer self-rated health (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.16-1.74), increased loneliness (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10-1.90), and increased satisfaction with life (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.64)."
2243,3,Study findings suggest that a non-negligible proportion of about 1 out of 10 individuals aged 46 years and over had online consultations with doctors or therapists. 
2244,3,"However, compared with other countries, this proportion remains small. "
2245,3,Knowledge about the correlates of (non)use may assist in identifying corresponding individuals. 
2246,3,"In times of reshaping the health care system, these efforts in online consultations with doctors or therapists may contribute to addressing patient needs. "
2247,3,"Moreover, increased use of such services may reduce the risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 by reducing social contact."
2248,4,Physician Burnout and the Electronic Health Record Leading Up to and During the First Year of COVID-19: Systematic Review
2249,0,"Physician burnout was first documented in 1974, and the electronic health record (EHR) has been known to contribute to the symptoms of physician burnout. "
2250,0,"Authors pondered the extent of this effect, recognizing the increased use of telemedicine during the first year of COVID-19."
2251,1,"No human participants were involved in this review; however, 100% of participants in studies analyzed were adult physicians. "
2252,1,"We queried 4 research databases and 1 targeted journal for studies commensurate with the objective statement from January 1, 2016 through January 31, 2021 (n=25)."
2253,2,"The hours spent in documentation and workflow are responsible for the sense of loss of autonomy, lack of work-life balance, lack of control of one's schedule, cognitive fatigue, a general loss of autonomy, and poor relationships with colleagues. "
2254,2,"Researchers have identified training, local customization of templates and workflow, and the use of scribes as strategies to alleviate the administrative burden of the EHR and decrease symptoms of burnout."
2255,3,The solutions provided in the literature only addressed 2 of the 3 factors (workflow and documentation time) but not the third factor (usability). 
2256,3,Practitioners and administrators should focus on the former 2 factors because they are within their sphere of control. 
2257,3,EHR vendors should focus on empirical evidence to identify and improve the usability features with the greatest impact. 
2258,3,Researchers should design experiments to explore solutions that address all 3 factors of the EHR that contribute to burnout.
2259,4,Development of a Prognostic App (iCanPredict) to Predict Survival for Chinese Women With Breast Cancer: Retrospective Study
2260,0,Accurate prediction of survival is crucial for both physicians and women with breast cancer to enable clinical decision making on appropriate treatments. 
2261,0,The currently available survival prediction tools were developed based on demographic and clinical data obtained from specific populations and may underestimate or overestimate the survival of women with breast cancer in China.
2262,1,Nine-year (January 2009-December 2017) clinical data of women with breast cancer who received surgery and adjuvant therapy from 2 hospitals in Xiamen were collected and matched against the death data from the Xiamen Center of Disease Control and Prevention. 
2263,1,All samples were randomly divided (7:3 ratio) into a training set for model construction and a test set for model external validation. 
2264,1,Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to construct a survival prediction model. 
2265,1,The model performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Brier score. 
2266,1,"Finally, by running the survival prediction model in the app background thread, the prognostic app, called iCanPredict, was developed for women with breast cancer in China."
2267,2,A total of 1592 samples were included for data analysis. 
2268,2,The training set comprised 1114 individuals and the test set comprised 478 individuals. 
2269,2,"Age at diagnosis, clinical stage, molecular classification, operative type, axillary lymph node dissection, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy were incorporated into the model, where age at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.031, 95% CI 1.011-1.051; P=.002), clinical stage (HR 3.044, 95% CI 2.347-3.928; P<.001), and endocrine therapy (HR 0.592, 95% CI 0.384-0.914; P=.02) significantly influenced the survival of women with breast cancer. "
2270,2,"The operative type (P=.81) and the other 4 variables (molecular classification [P=.91], breast reconstruction [P=.36], axillary lymph node dissection [P=.32], and chemotherapy [P=.84]) were not significant. "
2271,2,"The ROC curve of the training set showed that the model exhibited good discrimination for predicting 1-(area under the curve [AUC] 0.802, 95% CI 0.713-0.892), 5-(AUC 0.813, 95% CI 0.760-0.865), and 10-year (AUC 0.740, 95% CI 0.672-0.808) overall survival. "
2272,2,"The Brier scores at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis were 0.005, 0.055, and 0.103 in the training set, respectively, and were less than 0.25, indicating good predictive ability. "
2273,2,The test set externally validated model discrimination and calibration. 
2274,2,"In the iCanPredict app, when physicians or women input women's clinical information and their choice of surgery and adjuvant therapy, the corresponding 10-year survival prediction will be presented."
2275,3,This survival prediction model provided good model discrimination and calibration. 
2276,3,iCanPredict is the first tool of its kind in China to provide survival predictions to women with breast cancer. 
2277,3,"iCanPredict will increase women's awareness of the similar survival rate of different surgeries and the importance of adherence to endocrine therapy, ultimately helping women to make informed decisions regarding treatment for breast cancer."
2278,4,Digital Health Technologies to Improve Medication Adherence and Treatment Outcomes in Patients With Tuberculosis: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
2279,0,Nonadherence to medication in tuberculosis (TB) hampers optimal treatment outcomes. 
2280,0,Digital health technology (DHT) seems to be a promising approach to managing problems of nonadherence to medication and improving treatment outcomes.
2281,1,A literature search in PubMed and Cochrane databases was conducted. 
2282,1,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that analyzed the effect of DHT interventions on medication adherence outcomes (treatment completion, treatment adherence, missed doses, and noncompleted rate) and treatment outcomes (cure rate and smear conversion) were included. "
2283,1,Adult patients with either active or latent TB infection were included. 
2284,1,The Jadad score was used for evaluating the study quality. 
2285,1,The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline was followed to report study findings.
2286,2,"In all, 16 RCTs were selected from 552 studies found, and 6 types of DHT interventions for TB were identified: 3 RCTs examined video directly observed therapy (VDOT), 1 examined video-observed therapy (VOT), 1 examined an ingestible sensor, 1 examined phone call reminders, 2 examined medication monitor boxes, and 8 examined SMS text message reminders. "
2287,2,"The outcomes used were treatment adherence, including treatment completion, treatment adherence, missed dose, and noncompleted rate, as well as clinical outcomes, including cure rate and smear conversion. "
2288,2,"In treatment completion, 4 RCTs (VDOT, VOT, ingestible sensor, SMS reminder) found significant effects, with odds ratios and relative risks (RRs) ranging from 1.10 to 7.69. "
2289,2,"Treatment adherence was increased in 1 study by SMS reminders (RR 1.05; 95% CI 1.04-1.06), and missed dose was reduced in 1 study by a medication monitor box (mean ratio 0.58; 95% CI 0.42-0.79). "
2290,2,"In contrast, 3 RCTs of VDOT and 3 RCTs of SMS reminders did not find significant effects for treatment completion. "
2291,2,"Moreover, no improvement was found in treatment adherence in 1 RCT of VDOT, missed dose in 1 RCT of SMS reminder, and noncompleted rate in 1 RCT of a monitor box, and 2 RCTs of SMS reminders. "
2292,2,"For clinical outcomes such as cure rate, 2 RCTs reported that phone calls (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.07-1.59) and SMS reminders (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.13-5.43) significantly affected cure rates. "
2293,2,"However, 3 RCTs found that SMS reminders did not have a significant impact on cure rate or smear conversion."
2294,3,It was found that DHT interventions can be a promising approach. 
2295,3,"However, the interventions exhibited variable effects regarding effect direction and the extent of improving TB medication adherence and clinical outcomes. "
2296,3,Developing DHT interventions with personalized feedback is required to have a consistent and beneficial effect on medication adherence and outcomes among patients with TB.
2297,4,An Ethics Checklist for Digital Health Research in Psychiatry: Viewpoint
2298,0,"Psychiatry has long needed a better and more scalable way to capture the dynamics of behavior and its disturbances, quantitatively across multiple data channels, at high temporal resolution in real time. "
2299,0,"By combining 24/7 data-on location, movement, email and text communications, and social media-with brain scans, genetics, genomics, neuropsychological batteries, and clinical interviews, researchers will have an unprecedented amount of objective, individual-level data. "
2300,0,"Analyzing these data with ever-evolving artificial intelligence could one day include bringing interventions to patients where they are in the real world in a convenient, efficient, effective, and timely way. "
2301,0,"Yet, the road to this innovative future is fraught with ethical dilemmas as well as ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI)."
2302,1,"We explored the ELSI of digital health research in psychiatry, with a particular focus on what we label ""deep phenotyping"" psychiatric research, which combines the potential for virtually boundless data collection and increasingly sophisticated techniques to analyze those data. "
2303,1,"We convened an interdisciplinary expert stakeholder workshop in May 2020, and this checklist emerges out of that dialogue."
2304,2,"Consistent with recent ELSI analyses, we find that existing ethical guidance and legal regulations are not sufficient for deep phenotyping research in psychiatry. "
2305,2,"At present, there are regulatory gaps, inconsistencies across research teams in ethics protocols, and a lack of consensus among institutional review boards on when and how deep phenotyping research should proceed. "
2306,2,"We thus developed a new instrument, an Ethics Checklist for Digital Health Research in Psychiatry (""the Ethics Checklist""). "
2307,2,"The Ethics Checklist is composed of 20 key questions, subdivided into 6 interrelated domains: (1) informed consent; (2) equity, diversity, and access; (3) privacy and partnerships; (4) regulation and law; (5) return of results; and (6) duty to warn and duty to report."
2308,3,"Deep phenotyping research offers a vision for vastly more effective care for people with, or at risk for, psychiatric disease. "
2309,3,"The potential perils en route to realizing this vision are significant; however, and researchers must be willing to address the questions in the Ethics Checklist before embarking on each leg of the journey."
2310,4,Medical and Health-Related Misinformation on Social Media: Bibliometric Study of the Scientific Literature
2311,0,Social media has been extensively used for the communication of health-related information and consecutively for the potential spread of medical misinformation. 
2312,0,Conventional systematic reviews have been published on this topic to identify original articles and to summarize their methodological approaches and themes. 
2313,0,"A bibliometric study could complement their findings, for instance, by evaluating the geographical distribution of the publications and determining if they were well cited and disseminated in high-impact journals."
2314,1,"The Web of Science Core Collection electronic database was accessed to identify relevant papers with the following search string: ALL=(misinformati* OR ""wrong informati*"" OR disinformati* OR ""misleading informati*"" OR ""fake news*"") AND ALL=(medic* OR illness* OR disease* OR health* OR pharma* OR drug* OR therap*) AND ALL=(""social media*"" OR Facebook* OR Twitter* OR Instagram* OR YouTube* OR Weibo* OR Whatsapp* OR Reddit* OR TikTok* OR WeChat*). "
2315,1,"Full records were exported to a bibliometric software, VOSviewer, to link bibliographic information with citation data. "
2316,1,Term and keyword maps were created to illustrate recurring terms and keywords.
2317,2,"Based on an analysis of 529 papers on medical and health-related misinformation on social media, we found that the most popularly investigated social media platforms were Twitter (n=90), YouTube (n=67), and Facebook (n=57). "
2318,2,"Articles targeting these 3 platforms had higher citations per paper (>13.7) than articles covering other social media platforms (Instagram, Weibo, WhatsApp, Reddit, and WeChat; citations per paper <8.7). "
2319,2,"Moreover, social media platform-specific papers accounted for 44.1% (233/529) of all identified publications. "
2320,2,Investigations on these platforms had different foci. 
2321,2,"Twitter-based research explored cyberchondria and hypochondriasis, YouTube-based research explored tobacco smoking, and Facebook-based research studied vaccine hesitancy related to autism. "
2322,2,COVID-19 was a common topic investigated across all platforms. 
2323,2,"Overall, the United States contributed to half of all identified papers, and 80% of the top 10 most productive institutions were based in this country. "
2324,2,"The identified papers were mostly published in journals of the categories public environmental and occupational health, communication, health care sciences services, medical informatics, and medicine general internal, with the top journal being the Journal of Medical Internet Research."
2325,3,There is a significant platform-specific topic preference for social media investigations on medical misinformation. 
2326,3,"With a large population of internet users from China, it may be reasonably expected that Weibo, WeChat, and TikTok (and its Chinese version Douyin) would be more investigated in future studies. "
2327,3,"Currently, these platforms present research gaps that leave their usage and information dissemination warranting further evaluation. "
2328,3,Future studies should also include social platforms targeting non-English users to provide a wider global perspective.
2329,4,Effectiveness of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With Telephone Support for Noncardiac Chest Pain: Randomized Controlled Trial
2330,0,"Noncardiac chest pain has a high prevalence and is associated with reduced quality of life, anxiety, avoidance of physical activity, and high societal costs. "
2331,0,"There is a lack of an effective, low-cost, easy to distribute intervention to assist patients with noncardiac chest pain."
2332,1,"We conducted a randomized controlled trial, with a 12-month follow-up period, to compare internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy to a control condition (treatment as usual). "
2333,1,A total of 162 participants aged 18 to 70 years with a diagnosis of noncardiac chest pain were randomized to either internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (n=81) or treatment as usual (n=81). 
2334,1,The participants in the experimental condition received 6 weekly sessions of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy. 
2335,1,"The sessions covered different topics related to coping with noncardiac chest pain (education about the heart, physical activity, interpretations/attention, physical reactions to stress, optional panic treatment, and maintaining change). "
2336,1,"Between sessions, the participants also engaged in individually tailored physical exercises with increasing intensity. "
2337,1,"In addition to internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy sessions, participants received a brief weekly call from a clinician to provide support, encourage adherence, and provide access to the next session. "
2338,1,Participants in the treatment-as-usual group received standard care for their noncardiac chest pain without any restrictions. 
2339,1,"Primary outcomes were cardiac anxiety, measured with the Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire, and fear of bodily sensations, measured with the Body Sensations Questionnaire. "
2340,1,"Secondary outcomes were depression, measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire; health-related quality of life, measured using the EuroQol visual analog scale; and level of physical activity, assessed with self-report question. "
2341,1,"Additionally, a subgroup analysis of participants with depressive symptoms at baseline (PHQ-9 score >= 5) was conducted. "
2342,1,"Assessments were conducted at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3- and 12-month follow-ups. "
2343,1,Linear mixed models were used to evaluate treatment effects. 
2344,1,Cohen d was used to calculate effect sizes.
2345,2,"In the main intention-to-treat analysis at the 12-month follow-up time point, participants in the internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy group had significant improvements in cardiac anxiety (-3.4 points, 95% CI -5.7 to -1.1; P=.004, d=0.38) and a nonsignificant improvement in fear of bodily sensations (-2.7 points, 95% CI -5.6 to 0.3; P=.07) compared with the treatment-as-usual group. "
2346,2,"Health-related quality of life at the 12-month follow-up improved with statistical and clinical significance in the internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy group (8.8 points, 95% CI 2.8 to 14.8; P=.004, d=0.48) compared with the treatment-as-usual group. "
2347,2,Physical activity had significantly (P<.001) increased during the 6-week intervention period for the internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy group. 
2348,2,"Depression significantly improved posttreatment (P=.003) and at the 3-month follow-up (P=.03), but not at the 12-month follow-up (P=.35). "
2349,2,Participants with depressive symptoms at baseline seemed to have increased effect of the intervention on cardiac anxiety (d=0.55) and health-related quality of life (d=0.71) at the 12-month follow-up. 
2350,2,"In the internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy group, 84% of the participants (68/81) completed at least 5 of the 6 sessions."
2351,3,This study provides evidence that internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy with minimal therapist contact and a focus on physical activity is effective in reducing cardiac anxiety and increasing health related quality of life in patients with noncardiac chest pain.
2352,4,The Evolution and Disparities of Online Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccines: Year-long Longitudinal and Cross-sectional Study
2353,0,"Due to the urgency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, vaccine manufacturers have to shorten and parallel the development steps to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine production. "
2354,0,"Although all usual safety and efficacy monitoring mechanisms remain in place, varied attitudes toward the new vaccines have arisen among different population groups."
2355,1,"We collected over 1.4 billion tweets from June 2020 to July 2021, which cover some critical phases concerning the development and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. "
2356,1,"We first developed a data mining model that incorporates a series of deep learning algorithms for inferring a range of individual characteristics, both in reality and in cyberspace, as well as sentiments and emotions expressed in tweets. "
2357,1,"We further conducted an observational study, including an overall analysis, a longitudinal study, and a cross-sectional study, to collectively explore the attitudes of major population groups."
2358,2,Our study derived 3 main findings. 
2359,2,"First, the whole population's attentiveness toward vaccines was strongly correlated (Pearson r=0.9512) with official COVID-19 statistics, including confirmed cases and deaths. "
2360,2,Such attentiveness was also noticeably influenced by major vaccine-related events. 
2361,2,"Second, after the beginning of large-scale vaccine inoculation, the sentiments of all population groups stabilized, followed by a considerably pessimistic trend after June 2021. "
2362,2,"Third, attitude disparities toward vaccines existed among population groups defined by 8 different demographic characteristics. "
2363,2,"By crossing the 2 dimensions of attitude, we found that among population groups carrying low sentiments, some had high attentiveness ratios, such as males and individuals aged >= 40 years, while some had low attentiveness ratios, such as individuals aged <= 18 years, those with occupations of the 3rd category, those with account age <5 years, and those with follower number <500. "
2364,2,These findings can be used as a guide in deciding who should be given more attention and what kinds of help to give to alleviate the concerns about vaccines.
2365,3,"This study tracked the year-long evolution of attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines among various population groups defined by 8 demographic characteristics, through which significant disparities in attitudes along multiple dimensions were revealed. "
2366,3,"According to these findings, it is suggested that governments and public health organizations should provide targeted interventions to address different concerns, especially among males, older people, and other individuals with low levels of education, low awareness of news, low income, and light use of social media. "
2367,3,"Moreover, public health authorities may consider cooperating with Twitter users having high levels of social influence to promote the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines among all population groups."
2368,4,Application Scenarios for Artificial Intelligence in Nursing Care: Rapid Review
2369,0,Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health care service delivery. 
2370,0,"However, the perceptions and needs of such systems remain elusive, hindering efforts to promote AI adoption in health care."
2371,1,A systematic scoping review was conducted according to the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. 
2372,1,"Articles that described the perceptions and needs of AI in health care were searched across nine databases: ACM Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies that were published from inception until June 21, 2021. "
2373,1,"Articles that were not specific to AI, not research studies, and not written in English were omitted."
2374,2,"Of the 3666 articles retrieved, 26 (0.71%) were eligible and included in this review. "
2375,2,"The mean age of the participants ranged from 30 to 72.6 years, the proportion of men ranged from 0% to 73.4%, and the sample sizes for primary studies ranged from 11 to 2780. "
2376,2,"The perceptions and needs of various populations in the use of AI were identified for general, primary, and community health care; chronic diseases self-management and self-diagnosis; mental health; and diagnostic procedures. "
2377,2,"The use of AI was perceived to be positive because of its availability, ease of use, and potential to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of health care service delivery. "
2378,2,"However, concerns were raised regarding the lack of trust in data privacy, patient safety, technological maturity, and the possibility of full automation. "
2379,2,"Suggestions for improving the adoption of AI in health care were highlighted: enhancing personalization and customizability; enhancing empathy and personification of AI-enabled chatbots and avatars; enhancing user experience, design, and interconnectedness with other devices; and educating the public on AI capabilities. "
2380,2,Several corresponding mitigation strategies were also identified in this study.
2381,3,The perceptions and needs of AI in its use in health care are crucial in improving its adoption by various stakeholders. 
2382,3,Future studies and implementations should consider the points highlighted in this study to enhance the acceptability and adoption of AI in health care. 
2383,3,This would facilitate an increase in the effectiveness and efficiency of health care service delivery to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.
2384,4,Optimizing Readability and Format of Plain Language Summaries for Medical Research Articles: Cross-sectional Survey Study
2385,0,"Plain language summaries (PLSs) are intended to provide readers with a clear, nontechnical, and easily understandable overview of medical and scientific literature; however, audience preferences for specific PLS formats have yet to be fully explored."
2386,1,"Articles describing phase III clinical trials published in top-level, peer-reviewed journals between May 2016 and May 2018 were identified for 3 chronic disease states representing a range of adult patient age groups: (1) psoriasis, a skin disease representative of younger patients; (2) multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurological disease representative of middle-aged patients; and (3) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a painful joint disease representative of older patients. "
2387,1,"Four PLSs were developed for each research article, of which 3 were text-only summaries (written with high, medium, and low complexity) and 1 was an infographic. "
2388,1,"To evaluate each of the 4 PLS formats, a 20-question open survey (specific to one of the 3 diseases) was sent to a representative sample selected via UK-based patient association websites, Twitter, and Facebook patient groups. "
2389,1,A weighted-average calculation was applied to respondents' ranked preferences for each PLS format.
2390,2,"For all 3 articles, the weighted-average preference scores showed that infographic (psoriasis 2.91, MS 2.71, and RA 2.78) and medium-complexity text-based PLS (reading age 14-17 years, US Grade 9-11; psoriasis 2.90; MS 2.47; RA 2.77) were the two most preferred PLS formats."
2391,3,Audience preferences should be accounted for when preparing PLSs to accompany peer-reviewed original research articles. 
2392,3,"Oversimplified text can be viewed negatively, and graphical summaries or medium-complexity text-based summaries appear to be the most popular.Plain Language Summary: Patients and caregivers should have the chance to read about medical research in a format they can understand. "
2393,3,"However, we do not know much about the formats that people with different illnesses or ages prefer. "
2394,3,Researchers wanted to find out more about this. 
2395,3,"They selected 3 medical articles about illnesses that affect different age groups: psoriasis (younger patients), multiple sclerosis (middle-aged patients), and rheumatoid arthritis (older patients). "
2396,3,They created 4 summaries of each article. 
2397,3,"One was a graphical summary, and the other 3 were words-only summaries of high, medium, and low complexity. "
2398,3,"Then, the researchers posted surveys on UK patient group websites and Facebook patient groups to ask people what they thought of the summaries. "
2399,3,The surveys were taken by 167 people. 
2400,3,"These people were patients with psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, or rheumatoid arthritis, or their caregivers. "
2401,3,"Most were women, and about half had a university degree. "
2402,3,"For each illness, most people preferred the graphical summary. "
2403,3,"Among the word-only summaries, most people preferred the medium-complexity wording written for a reading age of 14 to 17 years. "
2404,3,"People felt that the graphical and medium-complexity summaries were clear and concise, while the others used jargon or were too simple. "
2405,3,Authors of medical articles should remember these results when writing summaries for patients. 
2406,3,"More research is needed about the preferences of other people, such as those with other illnesses. "
2407,3,(See Multimedia Appendix 1 for the graphical summary of the plain language summary.)
2408,4,Short Form of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist-Youth Self-Report (PSC-17-Y): Spanish Validation Study
2409,0,"The short form, 17-item version of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist-Youth Self-Report (PSC-17-Y) is a validated measure that assesses psychosocial problems overall (OVR) and in 3 major psychopathological domains (internalizing, externalizing, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), taking 5-10 min to complete. "
2410,0,Prior research has established sound psychometric properties of the PSC-17-Y for English speakers.
2411,1,"Data were collected on 5430 adolescents, aged 12-18 years, who filled out the PSC-17-Y twice during 2018-2019 (7-month interval). "
2412,1,"We calculated the Cronbach alpha and the McDonald omega coefficients to test reliability, the Pearson correlation for convergent (distress) and criterion validity (well-being, quality of life, and socioemotional skills), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for structure validity, and multigroup and longitudinal measurement invariance analysis for longitudinal and gender stability."
2413,2,"Within structural analysis for the PSC-17-Y, CFA supported a correlated 3-factor solution, which was also invariant longitudinally and across gender. "
2414,2,"All 3 subscales showed evidence of reliability, with coefficients near or above .70. "
2415,2,"Moreover, scores of PSC-17-Y subscales were positively related with convergent measures and negatively related with criterion measures. "
2416,2,Normative data for the PSC-17-Y are presented in the form of percentiles (75th and 90th).
2417,3,"This work provides the first evidence of the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the PSC-17-Y administered over the internet to assess mental health problems among adolescents, maintaining the same domains as the long version."
2418,4,"Practice Effects of Mobile Tests of Cognition, Dexterity, and Mobility on Patients With Multiple Sclerosis: Data Analysis of a Smartphone-Based Observational Study"
2419,0,Smartphones and their built-in sensors allow for measuring functions in disease-related domains through mobile tests. 
2420,0,"This could improve disease characterization and monitoring, and could potentially support treatment decisions for multiple sclerosis (MS), a multifaceted chronic neurological disease with highly variable clinical manifestations. "
2421,0,Practice effects can complicate the interpretation of both improvement over time by potentially exaggerating treatment effects and stability by masking deterioration.
2422,1,"We analyzed data from 264 people with self-declared MS with a minimum of 5 weeks of follow-up and at least 5 repetitions per test in the Floodlight Open study, a self-enrollment study accessible by smartphone owners from 16 countries. "
2423,1,The collected data are openly available to scientists. 
2424,1,"Using regression and bounded growth mixed models, we characterized practice effects for the following tests: electronic Symbol Digit Modalities Test (e-SDMT) for cognition; Finger Pinching and Draw a Shape for dexterity; and Two Minute Walk, U-Turn, and Static Balance for mobility."
2425,2,"Strong practice effects were found for e-SDMT (n=4824 trials), Finger Pinching (n=19,650), and Draw a Shape (n=19,019) with modeled boundary improvements of 40.8% (39.9%-41.6%), 86.2% (83.6%-88.7%), and 23.1% (20.9%-25.2%) over baseline, respectively. "
2426,2,"Half of the practice effect was reached after 11 repetitions for e-SDMT, 28 repetitions for Finger Pinching, and 17 repetitions for Draw a Shape; 90% was reached after 35, 94, and 56 repetitions, respectively. "
2427,2,"Although baseline performance levels were highly variable across participants, no significant differences between the short-term learning effects in low performers (5th and 25th percentile), median performers, and high performers (75th and 95th percentile) were found for e-SDMT up to the fifth trial (beta=1.50-2.00). "
2428,2,Only small differences were observed for Finger Pinching (beta=1.25-2.5). 
2429,2,"For U-Turn (n=15,051) and Static Balance (n=16,797), only short-term learning effects could be observed, which ceased after a maximum of 5 trials. "
2430,2,"For Two Minute Walk (n=14,393), neither short-term learning nor long-term practice effects were observed."
2431,3,Smartphone-based tests are promising for monitoring the disease trajectories of MS and other chronic neurological diseases. 
2432,3,"Our findings suggest that strong long-term practice effects in cognitive and dexterity functions have to be accounted for to identify disease-related changes in these domains, especially in the context of personalized health and in studies without a comparator arm. "
2433,3,"In contrast, changes in mobility may be more easily interpreted because of the absence of long-term practice effects, even though short-term learning effects might have to be considered."
2434,4,Noncontact Sleep Monitoring With Infrared Video Data to Estimate Sleep Apnea Severity and Distinguish Between Positional and Nonpositional Sleep Apnea: Model Development and Experimental Validation
2435,0,Sleep apnea is a respiratory disorder characterized by frequent breathing cessation during sleep. 
2436,0,"Sleep apnea severity is determined by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which is the hourly rate of respiratory events. "
2437,0,"In positional sleep apnea, the AHI is higher in the supine sleeping position than it is in other sleeping positions. "
2438,0,"Positional therapy is a behavioral strategy (eg, wearing an item to encourage sleeping toward the lateral position) to treat positional apnea. "
2439,0,"The gold standard of diagnosing sleep apnea and whether or not it is positional is polysomnography; however, this test is inconvenient, expensive, and has a long waiting list."
2440,1,A noncontact deep-learning algorithm was developed to analyze infrared video of sleep for estimating AHI and to distinguish patients with positional vs nonpositional sleep apnea. 
2441,1,"Specifically, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used to process movements extracted by optical flow to detect respiratory events. "
2442,1,Positional sleep apnea patients were subsequently identified by combining the AHI information provided by the 3D-CNN model with the sleeping position (supine vs lateral) detected via a previously developed CNN model.
2443,2,"The algorithm was validated on data of 41 participants, including 26 men and 15 women with a mean age of 53 (SD 13) years, BMI of 30 (SD 7), AHI of 27 (SD 31) events/hour, and sleep duration of 5 (SD 1) hours; 20 participants had positional sleep apnea, 15 participants had nonpositional sleep apnea, and the positional status could not be discriminated for the remaining 6 participants. "
2444,2,"AHI values estimated by the 3D-CNN model correlated strongly and significantly with the gold standard (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.79, P<.001). "
2445,2,Individuals with positional sleep apnea (based on an AHI threshold of 15) were identified with 83% accuracy and an F1-score of 86%.
2446,3,"This study demonstrates the possibility of using a camera-based method for developing an accessible and easy-to-use device for screening sleep apnea at home, which can be provided in the form of a tablet or smartphone app."
2447,4,Digital Interventions on Healthy Lifestyle Management: Systematic Review
2448,0,"Digital interventions have tremendous potential to improve well-being and health care conveyance by improving adequacy, proficiency, availability, and personalization. "
2449,0,They have gained acknowledgment in interventions for the management of a healthy lifestyle. 
2450,0,"Therefore, we are reviewing existing conceptual frameworks, digital intervention approaches, and associated methods to identify the impact of digital intervention on adopting a healthier lifestyle."
2451,1,"We conducted a systematic literature review to search the scientific databases (Nature, SpringerLink, Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed) that included digital interventions on healthy lifestyle, focusing on preventing obesity and being overweight as a prime objective. "
2452,1,Peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2020 were included. 
2453,1,We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and a framework for an evidence-based systematic review. 
2454,1,"Furthermore, we improved the review process by adopting the Rayyan tool and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles."
2455,2,"Our initial searches identified 780 potential studies through electronic and manual searches; however, 107 articles in the final stage were cited following the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. "
2456,2,"The identified methods for a successful digital intervention to promote a healthy lifestyle are self-monitoring, self-motivation, goal setting, personalized feedback, participant engagement, psychological empowerment, persuasion, digital literacy, efficacy, and credibility. "
2457,2,"In this study, we identified existing conceptual frameworks for digital interventions, different approaches to provide digital interventions, associated methods, and execution challenges and their impact on the promotion of healthy lifestyle management."
2458,3,"This systematic literature review selected intervention principles (rules), theories, design features, ways to determine efficient interventions, and weaknesses in healthy lifestyle management from established digital intervention approaches. "
2459,3,The results help us understand how digital interventions influence lifestyle management and overcome the existing shortcomings. 
2460,3,"It serves as a basis for further research with a focus on designing, developing, testing, and evaluating the generation of personalized lifestyle recommendations as a part of digital health interventions."
2461,4,Telemedicine in Intensive Care Units: Scoping Review
2462,0,The role of telemedicine in intensive care has been increasing steadily. 
2463,0,"Tele-intensive care unit (ICU) interventions are varied and can be used in different levels of treatment, often with direct implications for the intensive care processes. "
2464,0,"Although a substantial body of primary and secondary literature has been published on the topic, there is a need for broadening the understanding of the organizational factors influencing the effectiveness of telemedical interventions in the ICU."
2465,1,A research protocol outlining the method has been published in JMIR Research Protocols. 
2466,1,This review follows the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). 
2467,1,A core research team was assembled to provide feedback and discuss findings.
2468,2,A total of 3019 results were retrieved. 
2469,2,"After screening, 25 studies were included in the final analysis. "
2470,2,We were able to characterize the context of tele-ICU studies and identify three use cases for tele-ICU interventions. 
2471,2,"The first use case is extending coverage, which describes interventions aimed at extending the availability of intensive care capabilities. "
2472,2,"The second use case is improving compliance, which includes interventions targeted at improving patient safety, intensive care best practices, and quality of care. "
2473,2,"The third use case, facilitating transfer, describes telemedicine interventions targeted toward the management of patient transfers to or from the ICU."
2474,3,The benefits of tele-ICU interventions have been well documented for centralized systems aimed at extending critical care capabilities in a community setting and improving care compliance in tertiary hospitals. 
2475,3,No strong evidence has been found on the reduction of patient transfers following tele-ICU intervention.
2476,4,"Adaptation of a Theory-Based Social Networking and Gamified App-Based Intervention to Improve Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Adherence Among Young Men Who Have Sex With Men in Bangkok, Thailand: Qualitative Study"
2477,0,HIV disproportionately affects young Thai men who have sex with men (YMSM). 
2478,0,Recent studies report a high incidence and prevalence of HIV among Thai YMSM. 
2479,0,The Thai national guidelines have recommended pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) since 2014 for key populations; free PrEP has been piloted since 2019. 
2480,0,Smartphone-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an optimal platform for innovative PrEP adherence interventions for Thai YMSM.
2481,1,"We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with YMSM and key informant interviews (KIIs) with PrEP care providers in Bangkok, Thailand, to investigate PrEP adherence facilitators and barriers, preferences for functions and features in mHealth apps among YMSM, and how to best adapt the P3 app to the Thai context. "
2482,1,We conducted four FGDs with 4-8 participants per group and 15 KIIs.
2483,2,"For FGDs, 23 YMSM participated with a mean age of 20 years (range 18-21), 96% (22/23) enrolled in full-time education, and all owned smartphones. "
2484,2,"The mean age of KII participants was 40 (range 26-60) years; most were state health service providers, with the majority being counselors (6/15, 40%) and physicians (6/15, 40%). "
2485,2,"Overall, the facilitators and barriers for PrEP adherence identified were similar to those of MSM and YMSM globally including the United States. "
2486,2,"Key themes included Songtaweesin general recommendations for improving mHealth apps in Thailand, such as presenting reliable information in an appealing format, minimizing privacy risks, and addressing connectivity challenges. "
2487,2,"Additional themes focused on P3 Thailand adaptations and were related to cultural and stylistic preferences, engagement strategies, and recommendations for new functions. "
2488,2,"To develop the adapted app, P3 Thailand, these findings were balanced with resource limitations resulting in the prioritization of minor modifications: changes in app esthetics (color scheme, iconography, and imagery) and changes in the presentation of information in two of the app's features. "
2489,2,FGDs identified similar PrEP adherence facilitators and barriers to those already addressed within the app.
2490,3,"The core elements of the P3 app address major PrEP facilitators and barriers for Thai YMSM; however, changes to the app features, including stylistic presentation, were needed to appropriately customize the app to the Thai context. "
2491,3,"Given the similarities of facilitators and barriers for PrEP adherence globally, adapting existing PrEP mHealth solutions based on input from end users and key informants provides a promising approach. "
2492,3,"However, partnerships with local app designers and developers can improve the adaptation process and final product."
2493,4,Areas of Interest and Attitudes Toward Antiobesity Drugs: Thematic and Quantitative Analysis Using Twitter
2494,0,"Antiobesity drugs are prescribed for the treatment of obesity in conjunction with healthy eating, physical activity, and behavior modification. "
2495,0,"However, poor adherence rates have been reported. "
2496,0,Attitudes or beliefs toward medications are important to ascertain because they may be associated with patient behavior. 
2497,0,The analysis of tweets has become a tool for health research.
2498,1,"In this observational quantitative and qualitative study, we focused on tweets containing hashtags related to antiobesity drugs between September 20, 2019, and October 31, 2019. "
2499,1,Tweets were first classified according to whether they described medical issues or not. 
2500,1,"Tweets with medical content were classified according to the topic they referred to: side effects, efficacy, or adherence. "
2501,1,We additionally rated it as positive or negative. 
2502,1,"Furthermore, we classified any links included within a tweet as either scientific or nonscientific. "
2503,1,"Finally, the number of retweets generated as well as the dissemination and sentiment score obtained by the antiobesity drugs analyzed were also measured."
2504,2,"We analyzed a total of 2045 tweets, 945 of which were excluded according to the criteria of the study. "
2505,2,"Finally, 320 out of the 1,100 remaining tweets were also excluded because their content, although related to drugs for obesity treatment, did not address the efficacy, side effects, or adherence to medication. "
2506,2,"Liraglutide and semaglutide accumulated the majority of tweets (682/780, 87.4%). "
2507,2,"Notably, the content that generated the highest frequency of tweets was related to treatment efficacy, with liraglutide-, semaglutide-, and lorcaserin-related tweets accumulating the highest proportion of positive consideration. "
2508,2,We found the highest percentages of tweets with scientific links in those posts related to liraglutide and semaglutide. 
2509,2,Semaglutide-related tweets obtained the highest probability of likes and were the most disseminated within the Twitter community.
2510,3,"This analysis of posted tweets related to antiobesity drugs shows that the interest, beliefs, and experiences regarding these pharmacological treatments are heterogeneous. "
2511,3,The efficacy of the treatment accounts for the majority of interest among Twitter users.
2512,4,Prediction of Readmission in Geriatric Patients From Clinical Notes: Retrospective Text Mining Study
2513,0,Prior literature suggests that psychosocial factors adversely impact health and health care utilization outcomes. 
2514,0,"However, psychosocial factors are typically not captured by the structured data in electronic medical records (EMRs) but are rather recorded as free text in different types of clinical notes."
2515,1,"We performed a retrospective analysis using EMR notes of 43,216 hospitalization encounters in a hospital from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2019. "
2516,1,"The mean age of the cohort was 67.51 years (SD 15.87), the mean length of stay was 5.57 days (SD 10.41), and the mean intensive care unit stay was 5% (SD 22%). "
2517,1,We employed text-mining techniques to extract psychosocial topics that are representative of these patients and tested the utility of these topics in predicting 30-day hospital readmission beyond the predictive value of the LACE Index for Readmission.
2518,2,"The added text-mined factors improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the readmission prediction by 8.46% for geriatric patients, 6.99% for the general hospital population, and 6.64% for frequent admitters. "
2519,2,Medical social workers and case managers captured more of the psychosocial text topics than physicians.
2520,3,The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of extracting psychosocial factors from EMR clinical notes and the value of these notes in improving readmission risk prediction. 
2521,3,Psychosocial profiles of patients can be curated and quantified from text mining clinical notes and these profiles can be successfully applied to artificial intelligence models to improve readmission risk prediction.
2522,4,A Home-Based eHealth Intervention for an Older Adult Population With Food Insecurity: Feasibility and Acceptability Study
2523,0,"Food insecurity is a global public health challenge, affecting predominately the most vulnerable people in society, including older adults. "
2524,0,"For this population, eHealth interventions represent an opportunity for promoting healthy lifestyle habits, thus mitigating the consequences of food insecurity. "
2525,0,"However, before their widespread dissemination, it is essential to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of these interventions among end users."
2526,1,A pilot noncontrolled quasi-experimental study was designed with baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments. 
2527,1,Older adult participants with food insecurity were recruited from 17 primary health care centers in Portugal. 
2528,1,A home-based intervention program using an interactive TV app aimed at promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors was implemented over 12 weeks. 
2529,1,"Primary outcomes were feasibility (self-reported use and interest in eHealth) and acceptability (affective attitude, burden, ethicality, perceived effectiveness, and self-efficacy), which were evaluated using a structured questionnaire with a 7-point Likert scale. "
2530,1,"Secondary outcomes were changes in food insecurity (Household Food Insecurity Scale), quality of life (European Quality of Life Questionnaire with five dimensions and three levels and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue), physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire, Elderly Mobility Scale, grip strength, and regularity of exercise), and nutritional status (adherence to the Mediterranean diet)."
2531,2,A sample of 31 older adult individuals with food insecurity was enrolled in the 12-week intervention program with no dropouts. 
2532,2,A total of 10 participants self-reported low use of the TV app. 
2533,2,"After the intervention, participants were significantly more interested in using eHealth to improve food insecurity (baseline median 1.0, IQR 3.0; 3-month median 5.0, IQR 5.0; P=.01) and for other purposes (baseline median 1.0, IQR 2.0; 3-month median 6.0, IQR 2.0; P=.03). "
2534,2,"High levels of acceptability were found both before and after (median range 7.0-7.0, IQR 2.0-0.0 and 5.0-7.0, IQR 2.0-2.0, respectively) the intervention, with no significant changes for most constructs. "
2535,2,"Clinically, there was a reduction of 40% in food insecurity (P=.001), decreased fatigue (mean -3.82, SD 8.27; P=.02), and improved physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire: mean -0.22, SD 0.38; P=.01; Elderly Mobility Scale: mean -1.50, SD 1.08; P=.01; regularity of exercise: baseline 10/31, 32%; 3 months 18/31, 58%; P=.02). "
2536,2,"No differences were found for the European Quality of Life Questionnaire with five dimensions and three levels, grip strength, or adherence to the Mediterranean diet."
2537,3,"The home-based eHealth intervention was feasible and highly acceptable by participants, thus supporting a future full-scale trial. "
2538,3,The intervention program not only reduced the proportion of older adults with food insecurity but also improved participants' fatigue and physical function.
2539,4,"New Internet-Based Warfarin Anticoagulation Management Approach After Mechanical Heart Valve Replacement: Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial"
2540,0,"Mechanical heart valve replacement (MHVR) is an effective method for the treatment of severe heart valve disease; however, it subjects patient to lifelong warfarin therapy after MHVR with the attendant risk of bleeding and thrombosis. "
2541,0,Whether internet-based warfarin management reduces complications and improves patient quality of life remains unknown.
2542,1,"This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial with a 1-year follow-up. "
2543,1,Patients who needed long-term warfarin anticoagulation after MHVR were enrolled and then randomly divided into conventional and internet-based management groups. 
2544,1,"The percentage of time in the therapeutic range (TTR) was used as the primary outcome, while bleeding, thrombosis, and other events were the secondary outcomes."
2545,2,A total of 721 patients were enrolled. 
2546,2,"The baseline characteristics did not reach statistical differences between the 2 groups, suggesting the random assignment was successful. "
2547,2,"As a result, the internet-based group showed a significantly higher TTR (mean 0.53, SD 0.24 vs mean 0.46, SD 0.21; P<.001) and fraction of time in the therapeutic range (mean 0.48, SD 0.22 vs mean 0.42, SD 0.19; P<.001) than did those in the conventional group. "
2548,2,"Furthermore, as expected, the anticoagulation complications, including the bleeding and embolic events had a lower frequency in the internet-based group than in the conventional group (6.94% vs 12.74%; P=.01). "
2549,2,"Logistic regression showed that internet-based management increased the TTR by 7% (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% CI 1.05-1.09; P<.001) and reduced the bleeding and embolic risk by 6% (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.92-0.96; P=.01). "
2550,2,"Moreover, low TTR was found to be a risk factor for bleeding and embolic events (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.91; P=.005)."
2551,3,"The internet-based warfarin management is superior to the conventional method, as it can reduce the anticoagulation complications in patients who receive long-term warfarin anticoagulation after MHVR."
2552,4,Evaluation of a Social Media Campaign in Saskatchewan to Promote Healthy Eating During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Social Media Analysis and Qualitative Interview Study
2553,0,"The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic presented many sudden challenges regarding food, including grocery shopping changes (eg, reduced store hours, capacity restrictions, and empty store shelves due to food hoarding), restaurant closures, the need to cook more at home, and closures of food access programs. "
2554,0,"Eat Well Saskatchewan (EWS) implemented a 16-week social media campaign, #eatwellcovid19, led by a dietitian and nutrition student that focused on sharing stories submitted by the Saskatchewan public about how they were eating healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic."
2555,1,"Residents of Saskatchewan, Canada, were invited to submit personal stories and experiences to EWS about how they were eating healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic from April to August 2020. "
2556,1,"Each week, one to three stories were featured on EWS social media platforms-Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter-along with evidence-based nutrition information to help residents become more resilient to challenges related to food and nutrition experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. "
2557,1,Individuals who submitted stories were entered into a weekly draw for a Can $100 grocery gift card. 
2558,1,Social media metrics and semistructured qualitative interviews of campaign followers were used to evaluate the #eatwellcovid19 campaign.
2559,2,"In total, 75 stories were submitted by 74 individuals on a variety of topics (eg, grocery shopping, traditional skills, and gardening), and 42 stories were featured on social media. "
2560,2,EWS shared 194 #eatwellcovid19 posts across social media platforms (Facebook: n=100; Instagram: n=55; and Twitter: n=39). 
2561,2,"On Facebook, #eatawellcovid19 reached 100,571 followers and left 128,818 impressions, resulting in 9575 engagements. "
2562,2,"On Instagram, the campaign reached 11,310 followers, made 14,145 impressions, and received 823 likes and 15 comments. "
2563,2,"On Twitter, #eatwellcovid19 made 15,199 impressions and received 424 engagements. "
2564,2,Featured story submission posts had the best engagement on Facebook and the most likes and comments on Instagram. 
2565,2,The EWS social media pages reported increases in their following during the campaign (Instagram: +30%; Facebook: +14%; and Twitter: +12%). 
2566,2,"Results from the interviews revealed that there were two types of campaign followers: those who appreciated hearing the stories submitted by followers, as it helped them to feel connected to the community during social isolation, and those who appreciated the evidence-based information."
2567,3,Numerous stories were submitted to the #eatwellcovid19 social media campaign on various topics. 
2568,3,"On Instagram and Facebook, posts that featured these stories had the highest engagement. "
2569,3,"During this campaign, EWS's social media following increased by more than 10% on each platform. "
2570,3,The approach used for the #eatwellcovid19 campaign could be considered by others looking to develop health promotion campaigns.
2571,4,Measurement of Cancer-Related Fatigue Based on Heart Rate Variability: Observational Study
2572,0,"Cancer-related fatigue is a serious side effect of cancer, and its treatment can disrupt the quality of life of patients. "
2573,0,"Clinically, the standard method for assessing cancer-related fatigue relies on subjective experience retrieved from patient self-reports, such as the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). "
2574,0,"However, most patients do not self-report their fatigue levels."
2575,1,"In total, 12 patients with lung cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy or targeted therapy were enrolled. "
2576,1,We developed frequency-domain parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) and BFI based on a wearable-based HRV measurement system. 
2577,1,"All patients completed the BFI-Taiwan version questionnaire and wore the device for 7 consecutive days to record HRV parameters such as low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and LF-HF ratio (LF-HF). "
2578,1,Statistical analysis was used to map the correlation between subjective fatigue and objective data.
2579,2,A moderate positive correlation was observed between the average LF-HF ratio and BFI in the sleep phase (rho=0.86). 
2580,2,The mapped BFI score derived by the BFI mapping method could approximate the BFI from the patient self-report. 
2581,2,The mean absolute error rate between the subjective and objective BFI scores was 3%.
2582,3,LF-HF is highly correlated with the cancer-related fatigue experienced by patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy or targeted therapy. 
2583,3,"Beyond revealing fatigue levels objectively, continuous HRV recordings through the photoplethysmography watch device and the defined parameters (LF-HF) can define the active phase and sleep phase in patients with lung cancer who undergo chemotherapy or targeted chemotherapy, allowing a deduction of their sleep patterns."
2584,4,"Frequency of Self-Weighing and Weight Change: Cohort Study With 10,000 Smart Scale Users"
2585,0,Frequent self-weighing is associated with successful weight loss and weight maintenance during and after weight loss interventions. 
2586,0,Less is known about self-weighing behaviors and associated weight change in free-living settings.
2587,1,"This was an observational cohort study with 10,000 randomly selected smart scale users who had used the scale for at least 1 year. "
2588,1,Longitudinal weight measurement data were analyzed. 
2589,1,"The association between the frequency of self-weighing and weight change over the follow-up was investigated among normal weight, overweight, and obese users using Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear models. "
2590,1,The association between the frequency of self-weighing and temporal weight change was analyzed using linear mixed effects models.
2591,2,"The eligible sample consisted of 9768 participants (6515/9768, 66.7% men; mean age 41.5 years; mean BMI 26.8 kg/m2). "
2592,2,"Of the participants, 4003 (4003/9768, 41.0%), 3748 (3748/9768, 38.4%), and 2017 (2017/9768, 20.6%) were normal weight, overweight, and obese, respectively. "
2593,2,"During the mean follow-up time of 1085 days, the mean weight change was -0.59 kg, and the mean percentage of days with a self-weigh was 39.98%, which equals 2.8 self-weighs per week. "
2594,2,"The percentage of self-weighing days correlated inversely with weight change, r=-0.111 (P<.001). "
2595,2,"Among normal weight, overweight, and obese individuals, the correlations were r=-0.100 (P<.001), r=-0.125 (P<.001), and r=-0.148 (P<.001), respectively. "
2596,2,"Of all participants, 72.5% (7085/9768) had at least one period of >= 30 days without weight measurements. "
2597,2,"During the break, weight increased, and weight gains were more pronounced among overweight and obese individuals: 0.58 kg in the normal weight group, 0.93 kg in the overweight group, and 1.37 kg in the obese group (P<.001)."
2598,3,"Frequent self-weighing was associated with favorable weight loss outcomes also in an uncontrolled, free-living setting, regardless of specific weight loss interventions. "
2599,3,The beneficial associations of regular self-weighing were more pronounced for overweight or obese individuals.
2600,4,A Web Interface for Antibiotic Prescription Recommendations in Primary Care: User-Centered Design Approach
2601,0,Antibiotic misuse is a serious public health problem worldwide. 
2602,0,National health authorities release clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to guide general practitioners (GPs) in their choice of antibiotics. 
2603,0,"However, despite the large-scale dissemination of CPGs, GPs continue to prescribe antibiotics that are not recommended as first-line treatments. "
2604,0,This nonadherence to recommendations may be due to GPs misunderstanding the CPGs. 
2605,0,"A web interface displaying antibiotic prescription recommendations and their justifications could help to improve the comprehensibility and readability of CPGs, thereby increasing the adoption of recommendations regarding antibiotic treatment."
2606,1,A web interface was designed according to the same principles as e-commerce interfaces and was assessed by 117 GPs. 
2607,1,"These GPs were asked to answer 17 questions relating to the usefulness, user-friendliness, and comprehensibility and readability of the interface, and their satisfaction with it. "
2608,1,"Responses were recorded on a 4-point Likert scale (ranging from ""absolutely disagree"" to ""absolutely agree""). "
2609,1,"At the end of the evaluation, the GPs were allowed to provide optional, additional free comments."
2610,2,"The antibiotic prescription web interface consists of three main sections: a clinical summary section, a filter section, and a recommended antibiotics section. "
2611,2,"The majority of GPs appreciated the clinical summary (90/117, 76.9%) and filter (98/117, 83.8%) sections, whereas 48.7% (57/117) of them reported difficulty reading some of the icons in the recommended antibiotics section. "
2612,2,"Overall, 82.9% (97/117) of GPs found the display of drug properties useful, and 65.8% (77/117) reported that the web interface improved their understanding of CPG recommendations."
2613,3,"The web interface displaying antibiotic recommendations and their properties can help doctors understand the rationale underlying CPG recommendations regarding antibiotic treatment, but further improvements are required before its implementation into a clinical decision support system."
2614,4,Medical Insights from Posts About Irritable Bowel Syndrome by Adolescent Patients and Their Parents: Topic Modeling and Social Network Analysis
2615,0,Adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are increasingly seeking and sharing information about their symptoms in web-based health care forums. 
2616,0,"Their posts and those from their parents contain critical insights that can be used by patients, physicians, and caregivers to manage IBS symptoms."
2617,1,"Using topic modeling and social network analysis, in this study, we analyzed all the messages (over 750 topics and 3400 replies) posted on the IBS Group forum from 2010-2019 by adolescents with IBS aged 13-17 years and parents having children with IBS. "
2618,1,We first detected 6 major topics in the posts by adolescent patients and parents on teenagers' IBS symptoms and the interaction between the topics. 
2619,1,Social network analysis was then performed to gain insights into the nature of web-based interaction patterns among patients and caregivers.
2620,2,"Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and a latent Dirichlet allocation visualization tool, this study revealed 6 leading topics of concern in adolescents with IBS: school life, treatment or diet, symptoms, boys' ties to doctors, social or friend issues, and girls' ties to doctors. "
2621,2,"The top 6 topics in the parents' discussions were school life, girls' issues, boys' issues, diet choice, symptoms, and stress. "
2622,2,The analyses show that the adolescent patients themselves are most concerned about the effect of IBS on their everyday activities and social lives. 
2623,2,"For parents having daughters with IBS, their top concerns were related to the girls' school performance and how much help they received at school. "
2624,2,"For their sons, the parents were more concerned about the pain and suffering that their sons had to endure. "
2625,2,Both parents and adolescents gained social support from the web-based platform. 
2626,2,Topic modeling shows that IBS affects teenagers the most in the areas of pain and school life. 
2627,2,"Furthermore, the issues raised by parents suggest that girls are bothered more by school performance over pain, whereas boys show exactly the opposite: pain is of greater concern than school performance."
2628,3,This study represents the first attempt to leverage both machine learning approaches and social network analysis to identify top IBS concerns from the perspectives of adolescent patients and caregivers in the same health forum. 
2629,3,Young patients with IBS must face the challenges of social influences and anxiety associated with this health disorder in addition to physical pain and other symptoms. 
2630,3,Boys and girls are affected differently by pain and school performance and view the IBS impacts differently from the parents.
2631,4,Personal Health Information Management Among Older Adults: Scoping Review
2632,0,Older adults face growing health care needs and could potentially benefit from personal health information management (PHIM) and PHIM technology. 
2633,0,"To ensure effective PHIM and to provide supportive tools, it is crucial to investigate the needs, challenges, processes, and tools used by this subpopulation. "
2634,0,"The literature on PHIM by older adults, however, remains scattered and has not provided a clear picture of what we know about the elements that play a role in older adults' PHIM."
2635,1,"We carried out a scoping review of the literature from 1998 to 2020, which followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) framework. "
2636,1,"First, we executed a broad and structured search. "
2637,1,"We then carried out a qualitative analysis of papers pertinent to the topic taking into consideration the five elements of the patient work system as follows: (1) personal-level factors, (2) PHIM tasks, (3) tools used, (4) physical settings of PHIM activities, and (5) socio-organizational aspects."
2638,2,The review included 22 studies. 
2639,2,Consolidated empirical evidence was related to all elements of the patient work system. 
2640,2,Multiple personal factors affected PHIM. 
2641,2,"Various types of personal health information were managed (clinical, patient-generated, and general) and tools were used (electronic, paper-based, and others). "
2642,2,"Older adults'PHIM was intertwined with their surroundings, and various individuals participated. "
2643,2,"The largest body of evidence concerned personal factors, while findings regarding the physical environment of PHIM were scarce. "
2644,2,"Most research has thus far examined older adults as a single group, and scant attention has been paid to age subgroups."
2645,3,"Opportunities for further PHIM studies remain across all elements of the patient work system in terms of empirical, design science, or review work."
2646,4,Willingness to Adopt Health Information Among Social Question-and-Answer Community Users in China: Cross-sectional Survey Study
2647,0,COVID-19 has spread around the world and has increased the public's need for health information in the process. 
2648,0,"Meanwhile, in the context of lockdowns and other measures for preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread, the internet has surged as a web-based resource for health information. "
2649,0,"Under these conditions, social question-and-answer communities (SQACs) are playing an increasingly important role in improving public health literacy. "
2650,0,There is great theoretical and practical significance in exploring the influencing factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information.
2651,1,This study was conducted by administering a web-based questionnaire survey and analyzing the responses from a final total of 598 valid questionnaires after invalid data were cleaned. 
2652,1,"By using structural equation modelling, the influencing factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information were analyzed. "
2653,1,The moderating effects of variables were verified via hierarchical regression.
2654,2,"Performance expectation (beta=.282; P<.001), social influence (beta=.238; P=.02), and facilitating conditions (beta=.279; P=.002) positively affected users' willingness to adopt health information, whereas effort expectancy (P=.79) and perceived risk (P=.41) had no significant effects. "
2655,2,Gender had a significant moderating effect in the structural equation model (P<.001).
2656,3,"SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information was evidently affected by multiple factors, such as performance expectation, social influence, and facilitating conditions. "
2657,3,The structural equation model proposed in this study has a good fitting degree and good explanatory power for users' willingness to adopt health information. 
2658,3,Suggestions were provided for SQAC operators and health management agencies based on our research results.
2659,4,Analysis of COVID-19 Transmission Sources in France by Self-Assessment Before and After the Partial Lockdown: Observational Study
2660,0,We developed a questionnaire on a web application for analyzing COVID-19 contamination circumstances in France during the second wave of the pandemic.
2661,1,"Between December 15 and 24, 2020, after a national media campaign, users of the sourcecovid.fr web application were asked questions about their own or a close relative's COVID-19 contamination after August 15, 2020, in France. "
2662,1,"The data of the contamination's circumstances were assessed and compared before and after the second partial lockdown, which occurred on October 25, 2020, during the second wave of the pandemic and was ongoing on December 24, 2020."
2663,2,"As of December 24, 2020, 441,000 connections on the web application were observed. "
2664,2,A total of 2218 questionnaires were assessable for analysis. 
2665,2,"About 61.8% (n=1309) of the participants were sure of their contamination origin, and 38.2% (n=809) thought they knew it. "
2666,2,"The median age of users was 43.0 (IQR 32-56) years, and 50.7% (n=1073) were male. "
2667,2,The median incubation time of the assessed cohort was 4.0 (IQR 3-5) days. 
2668,2,"Private areas (family's or friend's house) were the main source of contamination (1048/2090, 50.2%), followed by work colleagues (579/2090, 27.7%). "
2669,2,"The main time of day for the contamination was the evening (339/961, 35.3%) before the lockdown and was reduced to 18.2% (86/473) after the lockdown (P<.001). "
2670,2,"The person who transmitted the virus to the user before and after the lockdown was significantly different (P<.001): a friend (382/1317, 29% vs 109/773, 14.1%), a close relative (304/1317, 23.1% vs 253/773, 32.7%), or a work colleague (315/1317, 23.9% vs 264/773, 34.2%). "
2671,2,"The main location where the virus was transmitted to the users before and after the lockdown was significantly different too (P<.001): home (278/1305, 21.3% vs 194/760, 25.5%), work (293/1305, 22.5% vs 225/760, 29.6%), collective places (430/1305, 33% vs 114/760, 15%), and care centers (58/1305, 4.4% vs 74/760, 9.7%)."
2672,3,Modalities of transmissions significantly changed before and after the second lockdown in France. 
2673,3,The main sources of contamination remained the private areas and with work colleagues. 
2674,3,"Work became the main location of contamination after the lockdown, whereas contaminations in collective places were strongly reduced."
2675,4,An Internet-Based Intervention for Cardiovascular Disease Management Integrated With Primary Care Electronic Health Records: Mixed Methods Evaluation of Implementation Fidelity and User Engagement
2676,0,Growing evidence supports the benefits of eHealth interventions to increase patient engagement and improve outcomes for a range of conditions. 
2677,0,"However, ineffective program delivery and usage attrition limit exposure to these interventions and may reduce their effectiveness."
2678,1,This is a mixed methods study of an internet-based intervention being evaluated for effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). 
2679,1,"The intervention comprised medication and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk data uploaded from the primary care electronic health record (EHR); interactive, personalized CVD risk score estimation; goal setting and self-monitoring; an interactive social forum; and optional receipt of heart health messages. "
2680,1,Fidelity was assessed over 12 months. 
2681,1,Trial outcomes were compared between low and high users. 
2682,1,"Data sources included program delivery records, web log data, trial data, and thematic analysis of communication records."
2683,2,"Most participants in the intervention group (451/486, 93%) had an initial training session conducted by telephone (413/447, 92.4% of participants trained), with a mean duration of 44 minutes (range 10-90 minutes). "
2684,2,"Staff conducted 98.45% (1776/1804) of the expected follow-ups, mostly by telephone or email. "
2685,2,"Of the 451 participants who commenced log-ins, 46.8% (211) were categorized as low users (defined as at least one log-in in 3 or fewer months of follow-up), 40.4% (182) were categorized as high users (at least one log-in in more than 3 months of follow-up), and 12.8% (58) were nonadopters (no log-ins after their training session). "
2686,2,The mean log-in frequency was 3-4 per month in ongoing users. 
2687,2,There was no significant difference between the groups in the primary trial outcome of adherence to guideline-recommended medications (P=.44). 
2688,2,"In unadjusted analyses, high users had significantly greater eHealth literacy scores (P=.003) and were more likely to meet recommended weekly targets for fruit (P=.03) and fish (P=.004) servings; however, the adjusted findings were not significant. "
2689,2,Interactive screen use was highest for goal tracking and lowest for the chat forum. 
2690,2,Screens with EHR-derived data held only an early interest for most users. 
2691,2,"Fidelity measures (reach, content, dose delivered, and dose received) were influenced by the facilitation strategies used by staff, invisible qualities of staff-participant communication, and participants' responsiveness to intervention attributes."
2692,3,A multifeature internet-based intervention was delivered with high fidelity to the RCT protocol and was regularly used by 40.4% (182/451) of users over 12 months. 
2693,3,"Higher log-in frequency as an indicator of greater intervention exposure was not associated with statistically significant improvements in eHealth literacy scores, lifestyle changes, or clinical outcomes. "
2694,3,Attributes of the intervention and individualized support influenced initial and ongoing use.
2695,4,Internet-Specific Epistemic Beliefs in Medicine and Intention to Use Evidence-Based Online Medical Databases Among Health Care Professionals: Cross-sectional Survey
2696,0,Evidence-based medicine has been regarded as a prerequisite for ensuring health care quality. 
2697,0,The increase in health care professionals' adoption of web-based medical information and the lack of awareness of alternative access to evidence-based online resources suggest the need for an investigation of their information-searching behaviors of using evidence-based online medical databases.
2698,1,Health care professionals in a university-affiliated teaching hospital were surveyed using the ISEBM questionnaire. 
2699,1,The partial least squares-structural equation modeling was conducted to analyze the reliability and validity of ISEBM. 
2700,1,"Furthermore, the structural model was analyzed to examine the possible linkages between health professionals' demographics, ISEBM, and intention to utilize the evidence-based online medical databases for clinical practice."
2701,2,A total of 273 health care professionals with clinical working experience were surveyed. 
2702,2,The results of the measurement model analysis indicated that all items had significant loadings ranging from 0.71 to 0.92 with satisfactory composite reliability values ranging from 0.87 to 0.94 and average variance explained values ranging from 0.70 to 0.84. 
2703,2,"The results of the structural relationship analysis revealed that the source of internet-based medical knowledge (path coefficient -0.26, P=.01) and justification of internet-based knowing in medicine (path coefficient 0.21, P=.001) were correlated with the intention to use evidence-based online medical databases. "
2704,2,"However, certainty and simplicity of internet-based medical knowledge were not. "
2705,2,"In addition, gender (path coefficient 0.12, P=.04) and academic degree (path coefficient 0.15, P=.004) were associated with intention to use evidence-based online medical databases for clinical practice."
2706,3,Advancing health care professionals' ISEBM regarding source and justification may encourage them to retrieve valid medical information through evidence-based medical databases. 
2707,3,"Moreover, providing support for specific health care professionals (ie, females, without a master's degree) may promote their intention to use certain databases for clinical practice."
2708,4,Testing the Digital Health Literacy Instrument for Adolescents: Cognitive Interviews
2709,0,"Despite the increasing number of youth seeking health information on the internet, few studies have been conducted to measure digital health literacy in this population. "
2710,0,"The digital health literacy instrument (DHLI) is defined as a scale that measures the ability to operate digital devices and read and write in web-based modes, and it assesses seven subconstructs: operational skills, navigation skills, information searching, evaluating reliability, determining relevance, adding self-generated content to a web-based app, and protecting privacy. "
2711,0,"Currently, there is no validation process of this instrument among adolescents."
2712,1,"Upon the approval of institutional review board protocol, cognitive interviews were conducted. "
2713,1,"A total of 34 adolescents aged 10-18 years (n=17, 50% female) participated in individual cognitive interviews. "
2714,1,Two rounds of concurrent cognitive interviews were conducted to assess the content validity of DHLI using the thinking aloud method and probing questions.
2715,2,"Clarity related to unclear wording, undefined technical terms, vague terms, and difficult vocabularies was a major issue identified. "
2716,2,Problems related to potentially inappropriate assumptions were also identified. 
2717,2,"In addition, concerns related to recall bias and socially sensitive phenomena were raised. "
2718,2,No issues regarding response options or instrument instructions were noted.
2719,3,"The initial round of interviews provided a potential resolution to the problems identified with comprehension and communication, whereas the second round prompted improvement in content validity. "
2720,3,Dual rounds of cognitive interviews provided substantial insights into survey interpretation when introduced to US adolescents. 
2721,3,This study examined the validity of the DHLI and suggests revision points for assessing adolescent digital health literacy.
2722,4,A Semiautomated Classification System for Producing Service Directories in Social and Health Care (DESDE-AND): Maturity Assessment Study
2723,0,"DESDE-LTC (Description and Evaluation of Services and DirectoriEs for Long-Term Care) is an international classification system that allows standardized coding and comparisons between different territories and care sectors, such as health and social care, in defined geographic areas. "
2724,0,"We adapted DESDE-LTC into a computer tool (DESDE-AND) for compiling a directory of care services in Andalucia, Spain."
2725,1,A system for semiautomated coding of service provision has been co-designed. 
2726,1,"A panel of 23 domain experts and a group of 68 end users participated in its maturity assessment that included its technology readiness level (TRL), usability, validity, adoption (Adoption Impact Ladder [AIL]), and overall degree of maturity [implementation maturity model [IMM]). "
2727,1,"We piloted the prototype in an urban environment (Seville, Spain)."
2728,2,The prototype was demonstrated in an operational environment (TRL 7). 
2729,2,"Sixty-eight different care services were coded, generating fact sheets for each service and its geolocation map. "
2730,2,"The observed agreement was 90%, with moderate reliability. "
2731,2,"The tool was partially adopted by the regional government of Andalucia (Spain), reaching a level 5 in adoption (AIL) and a level 4 in maturity (IMM) and is ready for full implementation."
2732,3,DESDE-AND is a usable and manageable system for coding and compiling service directories and it can be used as a core module of decision support systems to guide planning in complex cross-sectoral areas such as combined social and health care.
2733,4,Health Care Workers Reasons for Choosing Between Two Different COVID-19 Prophylaxis Trials in an Acute Pandemic Context: Single-Center Questionnaire Study
2734,0,"In April 2020, two independent clinical trials to assess SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis strategies among health care workers were initiated at our hospital: MeCOVID (melatonin vs placebo) and EPICOS (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine vs hydroxychloroquine vs combination therapy vs placebo)."
2735,1,Both trials were offered to health care workers through an internal news bulletin. 
2736,1,"After an initial screening visit, all subjects were asked to respond to a web-based survey."
2737,2,"In the first month, 206 health care workers were screened and 160 were randomized. "
2738,2,The survey participation was high at 73.3%. 
2739,2,"Health care workers cited ""to contribute to scientific knowledge"" (n=80, 53.0%), followed by ""to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection"" (n=33, 21.9%) and ""the interest to be tested for SARS-CoV-2"" (n=28, 18.5%), as their primary reasons to participate in the trials. "
2740,2,We observed significant differences in the expected personal benefits across physicians and nurses (P=.01). 
2741,2,"The vast majority of volunteers (n=202, 98.0%) selected the MeCOVID trial, their primary reason being their concern regarding adverse reactions to treatments in the EPICOS trial (n=102, 69.4%)."
2742,3,Health care workers' reasons to participate in prophylaxis trials in an acute pandemic context appear to be driven largely by their desire to contribute to science and to gain health benefits. 
2743,3,Safety outweighed efficacy when choosing between the two clinical trials.
2744,4,Predictive Analytics for Care and Management of Patients With Acute Diseases: Deep Learning-Based Method to Predict Crucial Complication Phenotypes
2745,0,"Acute diseases present severe complications that develop rapidly, exhibit distinct phenotypes, and have profound effects on patient outcomes. "
2746,0,Predictive analytics can enhance physicians' care and management of patients with acute diseases by predicting crucial complication phenotypes for a timely diagnosis and treatment. 
2747,0,"However, effective phenotype predictions require several challenges to be overcome. "
2748,0,"First, patient data collected in the early stages of an acute disease (eg, clinical data and laboratory results) are less informative for predicting phenotypic outcomes. "
2749,0,"Second, patient data are temporal and heterogeneous; for example, patients receive laboratory tests at different time intervals and frequencies. "
2750,0,"Third, imbalanced distributions of patient outcomes create additional complexity for predicting complication phenotypes."
2751,1,"From a major health care organization in Taiwan, we obtained a sample of 10,354 electronic health records that pertained to 6545 patients with peritonitis. "
2752,1,"The proposed method projects these temporal, heterogeneous, and clinical data into a substantially reduced feature space and then incorporates a latent regulator (latent parameter matrix) to obviate data insufficiencies and account for variations in phenotypic expressions. "
2753,1,"Moreover, our method employs cost-sensitive learning to further increase the predictive performance."
2754,2,We evaluated the efficacy of the proposed method for predicting two hepatic complication phenotypes in patients with peritonitis: acute hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. 
2755,2,"The following three benchmark techniques were evaluated: temporal multiple measurement case-based reasoning (MMCBR), temporal short long-term memory (T-SLTM) networks, and time fusion convolutional neural network (CNN). "
2756,2,"For acute hepatic encephalopathy predictions, our method attained an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.82, which outperforms temporal MMCBR by 64%, T-SLTM by 26%, and time fusion CNN by 26%. "
2757,2,"For hepatorenal syndrome predictions, our method achieved an AUC value of 0.64, which is 29% better than that of temporal MMCBR (0.54). "
2758,2,"Overall, the evaluation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms all the benchmarks, as measured by recall, F-measure, and AUC while maintaining comparable precision values."
2759,3,The proposed method learns a short-term temporal representation from patient data to predict complication phenotypes and offers greater predictive utilities than prevalent data-driven techniques. 
2760,3,"This method is generalizable and can be applied to different acute disease (illness) scenarios that are characterized by insufficient patient clinical data availability, temporal heterogeneities, and imbalanced distributions of important patient outcomes."
2761,4,Income-Generating Processes of Free Web-Based Digital Health Tools to Engage Patients: Qualitative Analysis
2762,0,"In recent years, digital tools have become a viable means for patients to address their health and information needs. "
2763,0,"Governments and health care organizations are offering digital tools such as self-assessment tools, symptom tracking tools, or chatbots. "
2764,0,"Other sources of digital tools, such as those offered through patient platforms, are available on the internet free of charge. "
2765,0,We define patient platforms as health-specific websites that offer tools to anyone with internet access to engage them in their health care process with peer networks to support their learning. 
2766,0,"Although numerous social media platforms engage users without up-front charges, patient platforms are specific to health. "
2767,0,"As little is known about their business model, there is a need to understand what else these platforms are trying to achieve beyond supporting patients so that patients can make informed decisions about the benefits and risks of using the digital tools they offer."
2768,1,Textual and visual data collected from a purposeful selection of 11 patient platforms from September 2013 to August 2014 were analyzed using framework analysis. 
2769,1,Data were systematically and rigorously coded and categorized according to key issues and themes by following 5 steps . 
2770,1,"familiarizing, identifying a thematic framework, indexing, charting, and mapping and interpretation. "
2771,1,We used open coding to identify additional concepts not captured in the initial thematic framework. 
2772,1,This paper reports on emergent findings on the business models of the platforms and their income-generating processes.
2773,2,"Our analysis revealed that in addition to patients, the platforms support other parties with interests in health and information exchanges. "
2774,2,"Patient platforms did not charge up-front fees but generated income from other sources, such as advertising, sponsorship, marketing (eg, sending information to users on behalf of sponsors or providing means for sponsors to reach patients directly), supporting other portals, and providing research services."
2775,3,"This study reports on the mechanisms by which some patient platforms generate income to support their operations, gain profit, or both. "
2776,3,"Although income-generating processes exist elsewhere on social media platforms in general, they pose unique challenges in the health context because digital tools engage patients in health and information exchanges. "
2777,3,This study highlights the need to minimize the potential for unintended consequences that can pose health risks to patients or can lead to increased health expenses. 
2778,3,"By understanding other interests that patient platforms support, our findings point to important policy implications, such as whether (and how) authorities might protect users from processes that may not always be in their best interests and can potentially incur costs to the health system."
2779,4,Effectiveness of Smartphone-Based Mindfulness Training on Maternal Perinatal Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial
2780,0,"Despite potential for benefit, mindfulness remains an emergent area in perinatal mental health care, and evidence of smartphone-based mindfulness training for perinatal depression is especially limited."
2781,1,Pregnant adult women who were potentially at risk of perinatal depression were recruited from an obstetrics clinic and randomized to a self-guided 8-week smartphone-based mindfulness training during pregnancy group or attention control group. 
2782,1,Mental health indicators were surveyed over five time points through the postpartum period by online self-assessment. 
2783,1,The assessor who collected the follow-up data was blind to the assignment. 
2784,1,"The primary outcome was depression as measured by symptoms, and secondary outcomes were anxiety, stress, affect, sleep, fatigue, memory, and fear."
2785,2,A total of 168 participants were randomly allocated to the mindfulness training (n=84) or attention control (n=84) group. 
2786,2,"The overall dropout rate was 34.5%, and 52.4% of the participants completed the intervention Mindfulness training participants reported significant improvement of depression (group x time interaction chi(2)(4) =16.2, P=.003) and secondary outcomes (chi(2)(4)= 13 . "
2787,2,"1, P=.01 for anxiety; chi(2)(4) =8.4, P=.04 for positive affect) compared to attention control group participants. "
2788,2,"Medium between-group effect sizes were found on depression and positive affect at postintervention, and on anxiety in late pregnancy (Cohen d=0.47, -0.49, and 0.46, respectively) Mindfulness training participants reported a decreased risk of positive depressive symptom (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS] score>9) compared to attention control participants postintervention (odds ratio [OR] 0.391, 95% CI 0.164-0.930) and significantly higher depression symptom remission with different EPDS reduction scores from preintervention to postintervention (OR 3.471-27.986). "
2789,2,"Parity did not show a significant moderating effect; however, for nulliparous women, mindfulness training participants had significantly improved depression symptoms compared to nulliparous attention control group participants (group x time interaction chi(2)(4) =18.1, P=.001)."
2790,3,Smartphone-based mindfulness training is an effective intervention in improving maternal perinatal depression for those who are potentially at risk of perinatal depression in early pregnancy. 
2791,3,Nulliparous women are a promising subgroup who may benefit more from mindfulness training.
2792,4,"RETRACTED: Assessing the Dissemination of COVID-19 Articles Across Social Media With Altmetric and PlumX Metrics: Correlational Study (Retracted article. See vol. 24, 2022)"
2793,0,The use of social media assists in the distribution of COVID-19 information to the general public and health professionals. 
2794,0,"Alternative-level metrics (ie, altmetrics) and PlumX metrics are new bibliometrics that can assess how many times a scientific article has been shared and how much a scientific article has spread within social media platforms."
2795,1,The top 100 articles with highest AASs were identified with Altmetric Explorer in May 2020. 
2796,1,"The AASs, journal names, and the number of mentions in various social media databases of each article were collected. "
2797,1,Citation counts and PlumX Field-Weighted Citation Impact scores were collected from the Scopus database. 
2798,1,"Additionally, AASs, PlumX scores, and citation counts were log-transformed and adjusted by +1 for linear regression, and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to determine correlations."
2799,2,"The median AAS, PlumX score, and citation count were 4922.50, 37.92, and 24.00, respectively. "
2800,2,"The New England Journal of Medicine published the most articles (18/100, 18%). "
2801,2,"The highest number of mentions (985,429/1,022,975, 96.3%) were found on Twitter, making it the most frequently used social media platform. "
2802,2,"A positive correlation was observed between AAS and citation count (r(2)=0.0973; P=.002), and between PlumX score and citation count (r(2)=0.8911; P<.001)."
2803,3,"Our study demonstrated that citation count weakly correlated with AASs and strongly correlated with PlumX scores, with regard to COVID-19 articles at this point in time. "
2804,3,Altmetric and PlumX metrics should be used to complement traditional citation counts when assessing the dissemination and impact of a COVID-19 article.
2805,4,How the Use of a Patient-Accessible Health Record Contributes to Patient-Centered Care: Scoping Review
2806,0,"Worldwide, patient-centered care is becoming a widely used concept in medical practice, getting more and more attention because of its proven ability to improve quality of care and reduce costs. "
2807,0,"Although several studies show that patient-accessible electronic health records (PAEHRs) influence certain aspects of patient-centered care, the possible contribution of PAEHR implementation to patient-centered care as a comprehensive concept has not, to our knowledge, been structurally evaluated to date."
2808,1,We followed PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. 
2809,1,"We identified literature in 5 databases, using the terms ""patient-accessible medical records,"" ""patient experiences,"" and ""professional experiences"" as key concepts. "
2810,1,A total of 49 articles were included and analyzed with a charting code list containing 10 elements of patient-centered care.
2811,2,"Studies were diverse in design, country of origin, functionalities of the investigated PAEHR, and target population. "
2812,2,Participants in all studies were adults. 
2813,2,"Most studies reported positive influence of PAEHR use on patient-centered care; patient accessible health records were appreciated for their opportunity to empower patients, inform patients about their health, and involve patients in their own care. "
2814,2,There were mixed results for the extent to which PAEHRs affected the relation between patients and clinicians. 
2815,2,"Professionals and patients in mental health care held opposing views concerning the impact of transparency, where professionals appeared more worried about potential negative impact of PAEHRs on the patient-clinician relationship. "
2816,2,Their worries seemed to be influenced by a reluctant attitude toward patient-centered care. 
2817,2,Disadvantaged groups appeared to have less access to and make less use of patient-accessible records than the average population but experienced more benefits than the average population when they actually used PAEHRs.
2818,3,The review indicates that PAEHRs bear the potential to positively contribute to patient-centered care. 
2819,3,"However, concerns from professionals about the impact of transparency on the patient-clinician relationship as well as the importance of a patient-centered attitude need to be addressed. "
2820,3,Potentially significant benefits for disadvantaged groups will be achieved only through easily accessible and user-friendly PAEHRs.
2821,4,"Social Capital-Accrual, Escape-From-Self, and Time-Displacement Effects of Internet Use During the COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Period: Prospective, Quantitative Survey Study"
2822,0,"COVID-19 has spread like wildfire across the globe, prompting many governments to impose unprecedented stay-at-home orders to limit its transmission. "
2823,0,"During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. "
2824,0,"Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive internet use amidst this unusual health crisis."
2825,1,This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. 
2826,1,"The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 UK and 474 US adult residents at two assessment points 2 months apart."
2827,2,"The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 36% (bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] 95% CI 33%-39%) at Time 1 (ie, initial time point) and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI 25%-30%) at Time 2 (ie, follow-up time point). "
2828,2,The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. 
2829,2,"The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. "
2830,2,"Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support."
2831,3,"During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the 2-month study period was high among the UK and US residents. "
2832,3,"Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression."
2833,4,Use of Telemedicine for Emergency Triage in an Independent Senior Living Community: Mixed Methods Study
2834,0,"Older, chronically ill individuals in independent living communities are frequently transferred to the emergency department (ED) for acute issues that could be managed in lower-acuity settings. "
2835,0,Triage via telemedicine could deter unnecessary ED transfers.
2836,1,"In the intervention community, a 950-resident independent senior living community, when a resident called for help, emergency medical technician-trained staff could engage an emergency medicine physician via telemedicine to assist with management and triage. "
2837,1,"We compared trends in the proportion of calls resulting in transport to the ED (ie, primary outcome) in the intervention community to two control communities. "
2838,1,Secondary outcomes were telemedicine use and posttransport disposition. 
2839,1,Semistructured focus groups of residents and staff were conducted to examine attitudes toward the intervention. 
2840,1,Qualitative data analysis used thematic analysis.
2841,2,"Although the service was offered at no cost to residents, use was low and we found no evidence of fewer ED transfers. "
2842,2,"The key barrier to program use was resistance from frontline staff members, who did not view telemedicine triage as a valuable tool for emergency response, instead perceiving it as time-consuming and as undermining their independent judgment."
2843,3,"Engagement of, and acceptance by, frontline providers is a key consideration in using telemedicine triage to reduce unnecessary ED transfers."
2844,4,"Biological, Chemical, and Nutritional Food Risks and Food Safety Issues From Italian Online Information Sources: Web Monitoring, Content Analysis, and Data Visualization"
2845,0,"With rapid evolution of the internet and web 2.0 apps, online sources have become one of the main channels for most people to seek food risk information. "
2846,0,"Thus, it would be compelling to analyze the coverage of online information sources related to biological, chemical, and nutritional food risks, and related safety issues, to understand the type of content that online readers are exposed to, possibly influencing their perceptions."
2847,1,"We performed an analysis of big data related to food risks by combining web monitoring techniques, content analysis, and data visualization of a large amount of unstructured text. "
2848,1,"Using a dictionary-based approach, a web monitoring app was instructed to automatically collect web content referring to the food risk and safety field. "
2849,1,Data were retrieved from March 2017 to February 2018. 
2850,1,"The validated corpus (N=12,163) was subject to automatic and manual content analysis. "
2851,1,Results were combined with descriptive statistics extracted from Web-Live and processed with Qlik Sense.
2852,2,"Nutritional risks and news about outbreaks, controls, and alerts were the most widely covered topics. "
2853,2,"Thematic sources devoted major attention to nutritional topics, whereas national sources covered food risks, especially during food emergencies. "
2854,2,"Regarding engagement on social media, readers' interest was higher for nutritional topics and animal welfare. "
2855,2,"Although traditional sources still publish a great amount of content related to food risks and safety, new mediators have emerged as alternative sources for food risk information."
2856,3,"This mixed methodological approach was demonstrated to be a useful means for obtaining an accurate characterization of the online discourse on food risks, and can provide insight into how the monitored sources contribute to the process of risk communication."
2857,4,"Perceived Impact of an Online Community Care Platform for Dutch Older Adults on Local Participation, Informal Caregiving, and Feelings of Connectedness: Pretest-Posttest Observational Study"
2858,0,"In a changing ageing society wherein older adults are increasingly expected to take care of themselves instead of relying on health care services, online community care platforms can help older adults to meet these expectations. "
2859,0,A considerable number of these online community care platforms have been introduced in several European countries based on their potential. 
2860,0,"However, their actual impact is unclear."
2861,1,An observational pretest-posttest study was conducted. 
2862,1,Participants were recruited via a web-based message on the Grubbenvorst-Online platform and data were collected via postal questionnaires among older users at the start of the study and 4 months later. 
2863,1,Data regarding the expectations and the perceived impact of Grubbenvorst-Online were compared and tested.
2864,2,Forty-seven Grabbenvorst-Online users with an average age of 74 years participated in this study. 
2865,2,"They were healthy, predominantly ""internet-skilled,"" and they found the internet important for maintaining social contacts. "
2866,2,"In general, the use of the online community care platform decreased during the 4-month follow-up period. "
2867,2,"The perceived impact of Grubbenvorst-Online was significantly lower than that expected regarding information provision (P=.003), seeking help from fellow villagers (P<.001), giving help to fellow villagers (P<.001), and consulting care or welfare services (P<.001)."
2868,3,"The findings of this study indicate that online community care platforms perhaps do not provide enough ""added value"" in their current form. "
2869,3,"We suggest a new direction in which online community care platforms primarily support existing offline initiatives aimed at stimulating local participation, informal caregiving, and feelings of connectedness."
2870,4,Concerns Expressed by Chinese Social Media Users During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Content Analysis of Sina Weibo Microblogging Data
2871,0,The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global health crisis that is affecting economies and societies worldwide. 
2872,0,"During times of uncertainty and unexpected change, people have turned to social media platforms as communication tools and primary information sources. "
2873,0,"Platforms such as Twitter and Sina Weibo have allowed communities to share discussion and emotional support; they also play important roles for individuals, governments, and organizations in exchanging information and expressing opinions. "
2874,0,"However, research that studies the main concerns expressed by social media users during the pandemic is limited."
2875,1,"We used a web crawler tool and a set of predefined search terms (New Coronavirus Pneumonia, New Coronavirus, and COVID-19) to investigate concerns raised by Sina Weibo users. "
2876,1,"Textual information and metadata (number of likes, comments, retweets, publishing time, and publishing location) of microblog posts published between December 1, 2019, and July 32, 2020, were collected. "
2877,1,"After segmenting the words of the collected text, we used a topic modeling technique, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), to identify the most common topics posted by users. "
2878,1,"We analyzed the emotional tendencies of the topics, calculated the proportional distribution of the topics, performed user behavior analysis on the topics using data collected from the number of likes, comments, and retweets, and studied the changes in user concerns and differences in participation between citizens living in different regions of mainland China."
2879,2,"Based on the 203,191 eligible microblog posts collected, we identified 17 topics and grouped them into 8 themes. "
2880,2,"These topics were pandemic statistics, domestic epidemic, epidemics in other countries worldwide, COVID-19 treatments, medical resources, economic shock, quarantine and investigation, patients' outcry for help, work and production resumption, psychological influence, joint prevention and control, material donation, epidemics in neighboring countries, vaccine development, fueling and saluting antiepidemic action, detection, and study resumption. "
2881,2,The mean sentiment was positive for 11 topics and negative for 6 topics. 
2882,2,"The topic with the highest mean of retweets was domestic epidemic, while the topic with the highest mean of likes was quarantine and investigation."
2883,3,Concerns expressed by social media users are highly correlated with the evolution of the global pandemic. 
2884,3,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has provided a platform for Chinese government departments and organizations to better understand public concerns and demands. "
2885,3,"Similarly, social media has provided channels to disseminate information about epidemic prevention and has influenced public attitudes and behaviors. "
2886,3,"Government departments, especially those related to health, can create appropriate policies in a timely manner through monitoring social media platforms to guide public opinion and behavior during epidemics."
2887,4,Computer-Tailored Decision Support Tool for Lung Cancer Screening: Community-Based Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
2888,0,Lung cancer screening is a US Preventive Services Task Force Grade B recommendation that has been shown to decrease lung cancer-related mortality by approximately 20%. 
2889,0,"However, making the decision to screen, or not, for lung cancer is a complex decision because there are potential risks (eg, false positive results, overdiagnosis). "
2890,0,"Shared decision making was incorporated into the lung cancer screening guideline and, for the first time, is a requirement for reimbursement of a cancer screening test from Medicare. "
2891,0,Awareness of lung cancer screening remains low in both the general and screening-eligible populations. 
2892,0,"When a screening-eligible person visits their clinician never having heard about lung cancer screening, engaging in shared decision making to arrive at an informed decision can be a challenge. "
2893,0,Methods to effectively prepare patients for these clinical encounters and support both patients and clinicians to engage in these important discussions are needed.
2894,1,A pilot randomized controlled trial with a community-based sample of 60 screening-eligible participants who have never been screened for lung cancer was conducted. 
2895,1,Approximately half of the participants (n=31) were randomized to view LungTalk-a web-based tailored computer program-while the other half (n=29) viewed generic information about lung cancer screening from the American Cancer Society. 
2896,1,"The outcomes that were compared included lung cancer and screening knowledge, lung cancer screening health beliefs (perceived risk, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy), and perception of being prepared to engage in a discussion about lung cancer screening with their clinician."
2897,2,Knowledge scores increased significantly for both groups with greater improvement noted in the group receiving LungTalk (2.33 vs 1.14 mean change). 
2898,2,Perceived self-efficacy and perceived benefits improved in the theoretically expected directions.
2899,3,"LungTalk goes beyond other decision tools by addressing lung health broadly, in the context of performing a low-dose computed tomography of the chest that has the potential to uncover other conditions of concern beyond lung cancer, to more comprehensively educate the individual, and extends the work of nontailored decision aids in the field by introducing tailoring algorithms and message framing based upon smoking status in order to determine what components of the intervention drive behavior change when an individual is informed and makes the decision whether to be screened or not to be screened for lung cancer."
2900,4,Public Interest in Acne on the Internet: Comparison of Search Information From Google Trends and Naver
2901,0,Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease primarily affecting young adults. 
2902,0,"Given that the internet has become a major source of health information, especially among the young, the internet is a powerful tool of communication and has a significant influence on patients."
2903,1,We compared the search volumes on acne vulgaris with those of other dermatological diseases using Google Trends from January 2004 to August 2019. 
2904,1,We also determined the search volumes for relevant keywords of acne vulgaris on Google and Naver and evaluated the quality of answers to the queries in KnowledgeiN.
2905,2,"The regression analysis of Google Trends data demonstrated that the patients' interest in acne vulgaris was higher than that for other dermatological diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (beta=-20.33, 95% CI -22.27 to -18.39, P<.001) and urticaria (beta=-27.09, 95% CI -29.03 to -25.15, P<.001) and has increased yearly (beta=2.38, 95% CI 2.05 to 2.71, P<.001). "
2906,2,"The search volume for acne vulgaris was significantly higher in the summer than in the spring (beta=-5.04, 95% CI -9.21 to -0.88, P=.018) and on weekends than on weekdays (beta=-6.68, 95% CI -13.18 to -0.18, P=.044). "
2907,2,"The most frequently searched relevant keywords with ""acne vulgaris"" and ""cause"" were ""stress,"" ""food,"" and ""cosmetics."" Among food, the 2 highest acne vulgaris-related keywords were milk and wheat in Naver and coffee and ramen in Google. "
2908,2,"The queries in Naver KnowledgeiN were mostly answered by a Korean traditional medicine doctor (53.4%) or the public (33.6%), but only 12.0% by dermatologists."
2909,3,"Physicians should be aware of patients' interest in and beliefs about acne vulgaris to provide the best patient education and care, both online and in the clinic."
2910,4,The Association Between Electronic Device Use During Family Time and Family Well-Being: Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study
2911,0,Electronic devices (eDevices) may have positive or negative influences on family communication and well-being depending on how they are used.
2912,1,"In 2017, a probability-based 2-stage random sampling landline telephone survey collected data on eDevice use in daily life and during family time (eg, family dinner) and the presence of rules banning eDevice use during family dinner. "
2913,1,Family communication quality was rated from 0 to 10 with higher scores being favorable. 
2914,1,Family well-being was calculated as a composite mean score of 3 items each using the same scale from 0 to 10. 
2915,1,The associations of family communication quality and well-being with eDevice use in daily life and during family time were estimated using beta-coefficient (beta) adjusting for sociodemographics. 
2916,1,The mediating role of family communication quality in the association between eDevice use and family well-being was analyzed.
2917,2,"Of the 2064 respondents (mean age 56.4 [SD 19.2] years, 1269/2064 [61.48%] female), 1579/2059 (76.69%) used an eDevice daily for a mean of 3.6 hours (SD 0.1) and 257/686 (37.5%) used it for 30+ minutes before sleep. "
2918,2,"As much as 794/2046 (38.81%) often or sometimes used an eDevice during family time including dinner (311/2017, 15.42%); 713/2012 (35.44%) reported use of an eDevice by family members during dinner. "
2919,2,"Lower family communication quality was associated with hours of eDevice use before sleep (adjusted beta=-.25; 95% CI -0.44 to -0.05), and often use (vs never use) of eDevice during family dinner by oneself (adjusted beta=-.51; 95% CI -0.91 to -0.10) and family members (adjusted beta=-.54; 95% CI -0.79 to -0.29). "
2920,2,"Similarly, lower family well-being was associated with eDevice use before sleep (adjusted beta=-.26; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.09), and often use during family dinner by oneself (adjusted beta=-.48; 95% CI -0.83 to -0.12) and family members (adjusted beta=-.50; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.28). "
2921,2,"Total ban of eDevice use during family dinner was negatively associated with often use by oneself (adjusted odds ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85) and family members (adjusted odds ratio 0.41; 95% CI 0.28, 0.60) but not with family communication and well-being. "
2922,2,Lower family communication quality substantially mediated the total effect of the association of eDevice use time before sleep (61.2%) and often use at family dinner by oneself (87.0%) and by family members (67.8%) with family well-being.
2923,3,"eDevice use before sleep and during family dinner was associated with lower family well-being, and the association was substantially mediated by family communication quality. "
2924,3,Our results suggest that interventions on smart use of eDevice may improve family communication and well-being.
2925,4,Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Behavior Change Model for Designing Artificial Intelligence Chatbots to Promote Physical Activity and a Healthy Diet: Viewpoint
2926,0,Chatbots empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with users. 
2927,0,Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet.
2928,1,We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. 
2929,1,We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. 
2930,1,"Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model."
2931,2,Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. 
2932,2,The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. 
2933,2,The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper.
2934,3,"As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. "
2935,3,There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles.
2936,4,Combating Health Care Fraud and Abuse: Conceptualization and Prototyping Study of a Blockchain Antifraud Framework
2937,0,An estimated US $2.6 billion loss is attributed to health care fraud and abuse. 
2938,0,"With traditional health care claims verification and reimbursement, the health care provider submits a claim after rendering services to a patient, which is then verified and reimbursed by the payer. "
2939,0,"However, this process leaves out a critical stakeholder: the patient for whom the services are actually rendered. "
2940,0,This lack of patient participation introduces a risk of fraud and abuse. 
2941,0,"Blockchain technology enables secure data management with transparency, which could mitigate this risk of health care fraud and abuse."
2942,1,"We developed a health care fraud and abuse blockchain technical framework and prototype using key blockchain tools and application layers including consensus algorithms, smart contracts, tokens, and governance based on digital identity on the Ethereum platform (Ethereum Foundation)."
2943,2,"Our technical framework maps to the claims adjudication process and focuses on Medicare claims, with the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as the central authority. "
2944,2,"A prototype of the framework system was developed using the blockchain platform Ethereum (Ethereum Foundation), with its design features, workflow, smart contract functions, system architecture, and software implementation outlined. "
2945,2,"The software stack used to build the system consisted of a front-end user interface framework, a back-end processing server, and a blockchain network. "
2946,2,"React was used for the user interface framework, and NodeJS and an Express server were used for the back-end processing server; Solidity was the smart contract language used to interact with a local Ethereum blockchain network."
2947,3,"The proposed framework and the initial prototype have the potential to improve the health care claims process by using blockchain technology for secure data storage and consensus mechanisms, which make the claims adjudication process more patient-centric for the purposes of identifying and preventing health care fraud and abuse. "
2948,3,Future work will focus on the use of synthetic or historic CMS claims data to assess the real-world viability of the framework.
2949,4,Converting Visitors of Physicians Personal Websites to Customers in Online Health Communities: Longitudinal Study
2950,0,"With the dramatic development of Web 2.0, increasing numbers of patients and physicians are actively involved in online health communities. "
2951,0,"Despite extensive research on online health communities, the conversion rate from visitor to customer and its driving factors have not been discussed."
2952,1,"An empirical study was conducted to examine the effects of physician-generated, patient-generated, and system-generated information on the conversion rate of physicians' personal websites by analyzing short panel data from 2112 physicians over five time periods in a Chinese online health community."
2953,2,"Multisource online health community information (ie, physician-generated, patient-generated, and system-generated information) positively affected the conversion rate. "
2954,2,Physician-generated and patient-generated information showed a substitute relationship rather than a complementary relationship. 
2955,2,"In addition, the usage time of a personal website positively moderated patient-generated information, but negatively moderated physician-generated information."
2956,3,This study contributes to the electronic health literature by investigating the conversion rate of online health communities and the effect of multisource online health community information. 
2957,3,"This study also contributes to understanding the drivers of conversion rate on service websites, which can help to successfully improve the efficiency of online health communities."
2958,4,Improving Patients Medication Adherence and Outcomes in Nonhospital Settings Through eHealth: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
2959,0,Electronic health (eHealth) refers to the use of information and communication technologies for health. 
2960,0,It plays an increasingly important role in patients' medication management.
2961,1,"We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, EmCare, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore, in addition to other published sources between 2000 and 2018. "
2962,1,"We evaluated the studies against the primary outcome measure of medication adherence and multiple secondary health care outcome measures relating to adverse events, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and health expenditure. "
2963,1,The quality of the studies included was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias (RoB) tool.
2964,2,"Our initial search yielded 9909 records, and 24 studies met the selection criteria. "
2965,2,"Of these, 13 indicated improvement in medication adherence at the significance level of P <.1 and 2 indicated an improved quality of life at the significance level of P<.01. "
2966,2,"The top 3 functions that were employed included mechanisms to communicate with caregivers, monitoring health features, and reminders and alerts. "
2967,2,"eHealth functions of providing information and education, and dispensing treatment and administration support tended to favor improved medication adherence outcomes (Fisher exact test, P=.02). "
2968,2,"There were differences in the characteristics of the study population, intervention design, functionality provided, reporting adherence, and outcome measures among the included studies. "
2969,2,"RoB assessment items, including blinding of outcome assessment and method for allocation concealment, were not explicitly reported in a large number of studies."
2970,3,All the studies included were designed for patient home-based care application and provided a mechanism to communicate with caregivers. 
2971,3,A targeted study population such as older patients should be considered to maximize the public health impact on the self-management of diseases.
2972,4,Natural Language Processing for Rapid Response to Emergent Diseases: Case Study of Calcium Channel Blockers and Hypertension in the COVID-19 Pandemic
2973,0,A novel disease poses special challenges for informatics solutions. 
2974,0,"Biomedical informatics relies for the most part on structured data, which require a preexisting data or knowledge model; however, novel diseases do not have preexisting knowledge models. "
2975,0,"In an emergent epidemic, language processing can enable rapid conversion of unstructured text to a novel knowledge model. "
2976,0,"However, although this idea has often been suggested, no opportunity has arisen to actually test it in real time. "
2977,0,The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents such an opportunity.
2978,1,We explored the effects of long-term treatment by calcium channel blockers on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with high blood pressure during in-patient hospital stays using two sources of information: data available strictly from structured electronic health records (EHRs) and data available through structured EHRs and text mining.
2979,2,"In this multicenter study involving 39 hospitals, text mining increased the statistical power sufficiently to change a negative result for an adjusted hazard ratio to a positive one. "
2980,2,"Compared to the baseline structured data, the number of patients available for inclusion in the study increased by 2.95 times, the amount of available information on medications increased by 7.2 times, and the amount of additional phenotypic information increased by 11.9 times."
2981,3,"In our study, use of calcium channel blockers was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. "
2982,3,This finding was obtained by quickly adapting an NLP pipeline to the domain of the novel disease; the adapted pipeline still performed sufficiently to extract useful information. 
2983,3,"When that information was used to supplement existing structured data, the sample size could be increased sufficiently to see treatment effects that were not previously statistically detectable."
2984,4,Tactics for Drawing Youth to Vaping: Content Analysis of Electronic Cigarette Advertisements
2985,0,"The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), also known as vaping, has risen exponentially among North American youth in recent years and has become a critical public health concern. "
2986,0,"The marketing strategies used by e-cigarette companies have been associated with the uptick in use among youth, with video advertisements on television and other electronic platforms being the most pervasive strategy. "
2987,0,It is unknown how these advertisements may be tapping into youth needs and preferences.
2988,1,"In phase 1, a scoping review was conducted to identify various influences on e-cigarette uptake among youth. "
2989,1,Results of this scoping review informed the development of a coding framework. 
2990,1,"In phase 2, this framework was used to analyze the content of e-cigarette advertisements as seen on 2 popular television channels (Discovery and AMC)."
2991,2,"In phase 1, a total of 20 articles met the inclusion criteria. "
2992,2,"The resultant framework consisted of 16 key influences on e-cigarette uptake among youth, which were categorized under 4 headings: personal, relational, environmental, and product-related. "
2993,2,"In phase 2, 38 e-cigarette advertisements were collected from iSpot.tv and represented 11 popular e-cigarette brands. "
2994,2,"All of the advertisements tapped into the cited influences of youth e-cigarette uptake, with the most commonly cited influences (product and relational) tapping into the most, at 97% (37/38) and 53% (20/38), respectively."
2995,3,"The findings highlight the multidimensional influences on youth uptake of e-cigarettes, which has important implications for developing effective antivaping messages, and assist public health professionals in providing more comprehensive prevention and cessation support as it relates to e-cigarette use. "
2996,3,The findings also bring forward tangible strategies employed by e-cigarette companies to recruit youth into vaping. 
2997,3,Understanding this is vital to the development of cohesive strategies that combat these provaping messages.
2998,4,Impact of a Multicomponent Digital Therapeutic Mobile App on Medication Adherence in Patients with Chronic Conditions: Retrospective Analysis
2999,0,"Strategies to improve medication adherence are widespread in the literature; however, their impact is limited in real practice. "
3000,0,"Few patients persistently engage long-term to improve health outcomes, even when they are aware of the consequences of poor adherence. "
3001,0,"Despite the potential of mobile phone apps as a tool to manage medication adherence, there is still limited evidence of the impact of these innovative interventions. "
3002,0,Real-world evidence can assist in minimizing this evidence gap.
3003,1,"A retrospective observational study was performed to assess the adherence rates of patients with any chronic condition using Perx Health, a digital therapeutic that uses multiple components within a mobile health app to improve medication adherence. "
3004,1,"These components include gamification, dosage reminders, incentives, educational components, and social community components. "
3005,1,Adherence was measured through mobile direct observation of therapy (MDOT) over 3-month and 6-month time periods. 
3006,1,"Implementation adherence, defined as the percentage of doses in which the correct dose of a medication was taken, was assessed across the study periods, in addition to timing adherence or percentage of doses taken at the appropriate time (+/- 1 hour). "
3007,1,The Friedman test was used to compare differences in adherence rates over time.
3008,2,"We analyzed 243 and 130 patients who used the app for 3 months and 6 months, respectively. "
3009,2,"The average age of the 243 patients was 43.8 years (SD 15.5), and 156 (64.2%) were female. "
3010,2,"The most common medications prescribed were varenicline, rosuvastatin, and cholecalciferol. "
3011,2,"The median implementation adherence was 96.6% (IQR 82.1%-100%) over 3 months and 96.8% (IQR 87.1%-100%) over 6 months Nonsignificant differences in adherence rates over time were observed in the 6-month analysis (Fr(2)=4.314, P=.505) and 3-month analysis (Fr(2)=0.635, P=.728). "
3012,2,"Similarly, the timing adherence analysis revealed stable trends with no significant changes over time."
3013,3,Retrospective analysis of users of a medication adherence management mobile app revealed a positive trend in maintaining optimal medication adherence over time. 
3014,3,"Mobile technology utilizing gamification, dosage reminders, incentives, education, and social community interventions appears to be a promising strategy to manage medication adherence in real practice."
3015,4,#BlackBreastsMatter: Process Evaluation of Recruitment and Engagement of Pregnant African American Women for a Social Media Intervention Study to Increase Breastfeeding
3016,0,"In the United States, there are lower rates of breastfeeding among African American mothers, particularly those who are younger women. "
3017,0,"Recent epidemiological studies have shown a strong association of more aggressive types of breast cancer (estrogen receptor negative) among African American women, with a higher risk in African American women who did not breastfeed their children."
3018,1,"This pilot study is conducted in collaboration with a local Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) organization and hospital and prenatal clinics of a local health care network. "
3019,1,"To engage African American women to enroll in the study, several methods and monitoring processes were explored, including WIC electronic text-based messages sent out to all phones of current WIC recipients (referred to as e-blasts); keyword responses to texts from flyers and posters in local community based organizations, hospitals, and prenatal clinics; keyword responses using electronic links posted in established Facebook groups; and snowball recruitment of other pregnant women by current participants through Facebook. "
3020,1,"Once enrolled, participants were randomized to 2 study conditions: (1) an intervention group receiving messages about breast cancer risk reduction and breastfeeding or (2) a control group receiving breastfeeding-only messages. "
3021,1,"Data were obtained through electronic monitoring, SurveyMonkey, qualitative responses on Facebook, focus groups, and interviews."
3022,2,More than 3000 text messages were sent and received through WIC e-blasts and keyword responses from flyers. 
3023,2,"A total of 472 women were recruited through WIC e-blast, and 161 responded to flyers and contacts through the local health care network, community-based organizations, Facebook, and friend referrals. "
3024,2,A total of 633 women were assessed for eligibility to participate in the study. 
3025,2,"A total of 288 pregnant African American women were enrolled, consented, and completed presurvey assessments (102.8% of the goal), and 22 participants attended focus groups or interviews reporting on their experiences with Facebook and the educational messages."
3026,3,"This process evaluation suggests that using electronic, smartphone apps with social media holds promise for both recruitment and conduct of health education intervention studies for pregnant African American women. "
3027,3,Providing messaging and resources through social media to reinforce and educate women about breastfeeding and potentially provide lactation support is intriguing. 
3028,3,Convenience (for researchers and participants) is an attribute of social media for this demographic of women and worthy of further research as an educational tool.
3029,4,Regional Infoveillance of COVID-19 Case Rates: Analysis of Search-Engine Query Patterns
3030,0,Timely allocation of medical resources for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) requires early detection of regional outbreaks. 
3031,0,Internet browsing data may predict case outbreaks in local populations that are yet to be confirmed.
3032,1,We used regional confirmed case data from the New York Times and Google Trends results from 50 states and 166 county-based designated market areas (DMA). 
3033,1,We identified search terms whose activity precedes and correlates with confirmed case rates at the national level. 
3034,1,We used univariate regression to construct a composite explanatory variable based on best-fitting search queries offset by temporal lags. 
3035,1,We measured the raw and z-transformed Pearson correlation and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the explanatory variable with out-of-sample case rate data at the state and DMA levels.
3036,2,"Predictions were highly correlated with confirmed case rates at the state (mean r=0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.81; median RMSE 1.27, IQR 1.48) and DMA levels (mean r=0.51, 95% CI 0.39-0.61; median RMSE 4.38, IQR 1.80), using search data available up to 10 days prior to confirmed case rates. "
3037,2,They fit case-rate activity in 49 of 50 states and in 103 of 166 DMA at a significance level of .05.
3038,3,"Identifiable patterns in search query activity may help to predict emerging regional outbreaks of COVID-19, although they remain vulnerable to stochastic changes in search intensity."
3039,4,Technology-Enabled Self-Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease With or Without Asynchronous Remote Monitoring: Randomized Controlled Trial
3040,0,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of mortality and leads to frequent hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits. 
3041,0,"COPD exacerbations are an important patient outcome, and reducing their frequency would result in significant cost savings. "
3042,0,"Remote monitoring and self-monitoring could both help patients manage their symptoms and reduce the frequency of exacerbations, but they have different resource implications and have not been directly compared."
3043,1,We conducted a 3-arm randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a remote monitoring and a self-monitoring program relative to standard care. 
3044,1,Patients with COPD were recruited from outpatient clinics and a pulmonary rehabilitation program. 
3045,1,"Patients in both interventions used a Bluetooth-enabled device kit to monitor oxygen saturation, blood pressure, temperature, weight, and symptoms, but only patients in the remote monitoring group were monitored by a respiratory therapist. "
3046,1,All patients were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after program initiation. 
3047,1,"Outcomes included self-management skills, as measured by the Partners in Health (PIH) Scale; patient symptoms measured with the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ); and the Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire (BCKQ). "
3048,1,"Patients were also asked to self-report on health system use, and data on health use were collected from the hospital."
3049,2,"A total of 122 patients participated in the study: 40 in the standard care, 41 in the self-monitoring, and 41 in the remote monitoring groups. "
3050,2,"Although all 3 groups improved in PIH scores, BCKQ scores, and SGRQ impact scores, there were no significant differences among any of the groups. "
3051,2,"No effects were observed on the SGRQ activity or symptom scores or on hospitalizations, ED visits, or clinic visits."
3052,3,"Despite regular use of the technology, patients with COPD assigned to remote monitoring or self-monitoring did not have any improvement in patient outcomes such as self-management skills, knowledge, or symptoms, or in health care use compared with each other or with a standard care group. "
3053,3,"This may be owing to low health care use at baseline, the lack of structured educational components in the intervention groups, and the lack of integration of the action plan with the technology."
3054,4,The Assessment of Supportive Accountability in Adults Seeking Obesity Treatment: Psychometric Validation Study
3055,0,Technology-mediated obesity treatments are commonly affected by poor long-term adherence. 
3056,0,Supportive Accountability Theory suggests that the provision of social support and oversight toward goals may help to maintain adherence in technology-mediated treatments. 
3057,0,"However, no tool exists to measure the construct of supportive accountability."
3058,1,Secondary data analyses were conducted in 2 obesity treatment studies to validate the SAM (20 items). 
3059,1,"Study 1 examined reliability, criterion validity, and construct validity using an exploratory factor analysis in individuals seeking obesity treatment. "
3060,1,Study 2 examined the construct validity of SAM in technology-mediated interventions involving different self-monitoring tools and varying amounts of phone-based interventionist support. 
3061,1,"Participants received traditional self-monitoring tools (standard, in-home self-monitoring scale [SC group]), newer, technology-based self-monitoring tools (TECH group), or these newer technology tools plus additional phone-based support (TECH+PHONE group). "
3062,1,"Given that the TECH+PHONE group involves more interventionist support, we hypothesized that this group would have greater supportive accountability than the other 2 arms."
3063,2,"In Study 1 (n=353), the SAM showed strong reliability (Cronbach alpha=.92). "
3064,2,"A factor analysis revealed a 3-factor solution (representing Support for Healthy Eating Habits, Support for Exercise Habits, and Perceptions of Accountability) that explained 69% of the variance. "
3065,2,"Convergent validity was established using items from the motivation for weight loss scale, specifically the social regulation subscale (r=0.33; P<.001) and social pressure for weight loss subscale (r=0.23; P<.001). "
3066,2,"In Study 2 (n=80), the TECH+PHONE group reported significantly higher SAM scores at 6 months compared with the SC and TECH groups (r(2) =0.45; P<.001). "
3067,2,"Higher SAM scores were associated with higher adherence to weight management behaviors, including higher scores on subscales representing healthy dietary choices, the use of self-monitoring strategies, and positive psychological coping with weight management challenges. "
3068,2,The association between total SAM scores and percent weight change was in the expected direction but not statistically significant (r=-0.26; P=.06).
3069,3,The SAM has strong reliability and validity across the 2 studies. 
3070,3,Future studies may consider using the SAM in technology-mediated weight loss treatment to better understand whether support and accountability are adequately represented and how supportive accountability impacts treatment adherence and outcomes.
3071,4,Clinical Characteristics of an Internet-Based Cohort of Patient-Reported Diagnosis of Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis and Microscopic Polyangiitis: Observational Study
3072,0,Utilizing the traditional centers of excellence approach to conduct clinical trials involving rare diseases remains challenging. 
3073,0,Patient-based registries have been shown to be both feasible and valid in several other diseases.
3074,1,Patients with a self-reported diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis in an internet-based prospective longitudinal cohort (from the Vasculitis Patient-Powered Research Network) were included. 
3075,1,"Data on symptoms, diagnostic testing, and treatment were collected using standardized questionnaires."
3076,2,The study compared patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (n=762) and patients with microscopic polyangiitis (n=164). 
3077,2,"Of the cohort, 97.7% (904/925) reported the diagnosis had been confirmed by a physician. "
3078,2,"Compared to microscopic polyangiitis, patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis reported significantly more ear, nose, and throat manifestations (granulomatosis with polyangiitis: 641/723, 88.7%; microscopic polyangiitis: 89/164, 54.3%; z=10.42, P<.001), fevers (granulomatosis with polyangiitis: 325/588, 55.3%; microscopic polyangiitis: 64/139, 46.0%; z=1.96, P=.05), joint involvement (granulomatosis with polyangiitis: 549/688, 79.8%; microscopic polyangiitis: 106/154, 68.8%; z=2.96, P=.003), and pulmonary involvement (granulomatosis with polyangiitis: 523/734, 71.3%; microscopic polyangiitis: 90/154, 58.4%; z=3.13, P=.002). "
3079,2,"Compared to microscopic polyangiitis, patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis reported significantly less renal involvement (granulomatosis with polyangiitis: 457/743, 61.5%; microscopic polyangiitis: 135/163, 82.8%; z=-5.18, P<.001) and renal transplantation (granulomatosis with polyangiitis: 10/721, 1.4%; microscopic polyangiitis: 7/164, 4.3%; z=-2.43, P=.02). "
3080,2,Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity was reported in 94.2% (652/692) of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and 96.1% (147/153) of patients with microscopic polyangiitis. 
3081,2,A biopsy showing vasculitis was reported in 77.0% (562/730) of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and 81.9% (131/160) of patients with microscopic polyangiitis.
3082,3,"In this large, internet-based cohort of patients with a self-reported diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis, disease manifestations were consistent with expectations for each type of vasculitis. "
3083,3,"Given the rarity of these and other vasculitides, conducting some types of research through internet-based registries may provide an efficient alternative to inperson, center-of-excellence clinical trials."
3084,4,Eating Disorder Awareness Campaigns: Thematic and Quantitative Analysis Using Twitter
3085,0,Health awareness initiatives are frequent but their efficacy is a matter of controversy. 
3086,0,We have investigated the effect of the Eating Disorder Awareness Week and Wake Up Weight Watchers campaigns on Twitter.
3087,1,"Over a period of 12 consecutive days in 2018, we collected tweets containing the hashtag #wakeupweightwatchers and hashtags related to Eating Disorder Awareness Week (#eatingdisorderawarenessweek, #eatingdisorderawareness, or #EDAW), with the hashtag #eatingdisorder as a control. "
3088,1,"The content of each tweet was rated as medical, testimony, help offer, awareness, pro-ana, or anti-ana. "
3089,1,"We analyzed the number of retweets and favorites generated, as well as the potential reach and impact of the hashtags and the characteristics of contributors."
3090,2,"The number of #wakeupweightwatchers tweets was higher than that of Eating Disorder Awareness Week and #eatingdisorder tweets (3900, 2056, and 1057, respectively). "
3091,2,The content of tweets was significantly different between the hashtags analyzed (P<.001). 
3092,2,Medical content was lower in the awareness campaigns. 
3093,2,Awareness and help offer content were lower in #wakeupweightwatchers tweets. 
3094,2,Retweet and favorite ratios were highest in #wakeupweightwatchers tweets. 
3095,2,"Eating Disorder Awareness Week achieved the highest impact, and very influential contributors participated."
3096,3,Both awareness campaigns effectively promoted tweeting about eating disorders. 
3097,3,The majority of tweets did not promote any specific preventive or help-seeking behaviors.
3098,4,Public Perception of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Care: Content Analysis of Social Media
3099,0,"High-quality medical resources are in high demand worldwide, and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical care may help alleviate the crisis related to this shortage. "
3100,0,The development of the medical AI industry depends to a certain extent on whether industry experts have a comprehensive understanding of the public's views on medical AI. 
3101,0,"Currently, the opinions of the general public on this matter remain unclear."
3102,1,"Through an application programming interface, we collected a data set from the Sina Weibo platform comprising more than 16 million users throughout China by crawling all public posts from January to December 2017. "
3103,1,"Based on this data set, we identified 2315 posts related to AI in medical care and classified them through content analysis."
3104,2,"Among the 2315 identified posts, we found three types of AI topics discussed on the platform: (1) technology and application (n=987, 42.63%), (2) industry development (n=706, 30.50%), and (3) impact on society (n=622, 26.87%). "
3105,2,"Out of 956 posts where public attitudes were expressed, 59.4% (n=568), 34.4% (n=329), and 6.2% (n=59) of the posts expressed positive, neutral, and negative attitudes, respectively. "
3106,2,"The immaturity of AI technology (27/59, 46%) and a distrust of related companies (n=15, 25%) were the two main reasons for the negative attitudes. "
3107,2,"Across 200 posts that mentioned public attitudes toward replacing human doctors with AI, 47.5% (n=95) and 32.5% (n=65) of the posts expressed that AI would completely or partially replace human doctors, respectively. "
3108,2,"In comparison, 20.0% (n=40) of the posts expressed that AI would not replace human doctors."
3109,3,Our findings indicate that people are most concerned about AI technology and applications. 
3110,3,"Generally, the majority of people held positive attitudes and believed that AI doctors would completely or partially replace human ones. "
3111,3,"Compared with previous studies on medical doctors, the general public has a more positive attitude toward medical AI. "
3112,3,Lack of trust in AI and the absence of the humanistic care factor are essential reasons why some people still have a negative attitude toward medical AI. 
3113,3,We suggest that practitioners may need to pay more attention to promoting the credibility of technology companies and meeting patients' emotional needs instead of focusing merely on technical issues.
3114,4,Toward the Development of Data Governance Standards for Using Clinical Free-Text Data in Health Research: Position Paper
3115,0,"Clinical free-text data (eg, outpatient letters or nursing notes) represent a vast, untapped source of rich information that, if more accessible for research, would clarify and supplement information coded in structured data fields. "
3116,0,"Data usually need to be deidentified or anonymized before they can be reused for research, but there is a lack of established guidelines to govern effective deidentification and use of free-text information and avoid damaging data utility as a by-product."
3117,1,We outlined data protection legislation and regulations relating to the United Kingdom for context and conducted a rapid literature review and UK-based case studies to explore data governance models used in working with free-text data. 
3118,1,"We also engaged with stakeholders, including text-mining researchers and the general public, to explore perceived barriers and solutions in working with clinical free-text."
3119,2,"We proposed a set of recommendations, including the need for authoritative guidance on data governance for the reuse of free-text data, to ensure public transparency in data flows and uses, to treat deidentified free-text data as potentially identifiable with use limited to accredited data safe havens, and to commit to a culture of continuous improvement to understand the relationships between the efficacy of deidentification and reidentification risks, so this can be communicated to all stakeholders."
3120,3,"By drawing together the findings of a combination of activities, we present a position paper to contribute to the development of data governance standards for the reuse of clinical free-text data for secondary purposes. "
3121,3,"While working in accordance with existing data governance frameworks, there is a need for further work to take forward the recommendations we have proposed, with commitment and investment, to assure and expand the safe reuse of clinical free-text data for public benefit."
3122,4,Internet of Things Smart Sunscreen Station: Descriptive Proof-of-Concept Study
3123,0,Skin cancer is the most prevalent but also most preventable cancer in Australia. 
3124,0,"Outdoor workers are at increased risk of developing skin cancer, and improvements in sun protection are needed. "
3125,0,"Sunscreen, when applied at the recommended concentration (2 mg/cm(2)), has been shown to block the harmful molecular effects of ultraviolet radiation in vivo. "
3126,0,"However, sunscreen is often not applied, reapplied sufficiently, or stored adequately to yield protection and reduce sunburns."
3127,1,"We deployed a smart sunscreen station and examined the key technological considerations including connectivity, security, and data management systems."
3128,2,"The smart sunscreen station was deployed for 12 days at a mining workplace (Dalby, Australia). "
3129,2,"The smart sunscreen station's electrical components remained operational during field testing, and data were received by the message queuing telemetry transport server automatically at the end of each day of field testing (12/12 days, 100% connectivity)."
3130,3,This study highlights that an Internet of Things technology approach can successfully measure sunscreen usage and temperature storage conditions.
3131,4,Using Reports of Symptoms and Diagnoses on Social Media to Predict COVID-19 Case Counts in Mainland China: Observational Infoveillance Study
3132,0,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. 
3133,0,"This disease poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems because screening and surveillance capacity is often severely limited, especially during the beginning of the outbreak; this can fuel the outbreak, as many patients can unknowingly infect other people."
3134,1,"We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million people, approximately half the entire monthly active Weibo user population. "
3135,1,"Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and analyzed around 15 million COVID-19-related posts from our user pool from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. "
3136,1,"We developed a machine learning classifier to identify ""sick posts,"" in which users report their own or other people's symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19. "
3137,1,"Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. "
3138,1,"For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China."
3139,2,"We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. "
3140,2,"For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline."
3141,3,Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses. 
3142,3,Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. 
3143,3,"In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance."
3144,4,"The Development of a Web-Based, Patient-Centered Intervention for Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CMyLife): Design Thinking Development Approach"
3145,0,"With the global rise in chronic health conditions, health care is transforming, and patient empowerment is being emphasized to improve treatment outcomes and reduce health care costs. "
3146,0,Patient-centered innovations are needed. 
3147,0,"We focused on patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a chronic disease with a generally good long-term prognosis because of the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. "
3148,0,"However, both medication adherence by patients and guideline adherence by physicians are suboptimal, unnecessarily jeopardizing treatment outcomes."
3149,1,"The 5 phases of design thinking (ie, empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test) were completed, and each phase started with the patient. "
3150,1,"Stakeholders and end users were identified and interviewed, and observations in the care system were made. "
3151,1,"Using tools in human-centered design, problems were defined and various prototypes of solutions were generated. "
3152,1,These were evaluated by patients and stakeholders and then further refined.
3153,2,"The patients desired (1) insights into their own disease; (2) insights into the symptoms experienced, both in terms of knowledge and comprehension; and (3) improvements in the organization of care delivery. "
3154,2,"A web-based platform, CMyLife, was developed and pilot-tested. "
3155,2,"It has multiple features, all targeting parts of the bigger solution, including a website with reliable information and a forum, a guideline app, personal medical records with logs of symptoms and laboratory results (including a molecular marker and linked to the guideline app), tailored feedback based on the patients'symptoms and/or results, screen-to-screen consulting, delivery of medication, and the collection of blood samples at home."
3156,3,"The multifeatured innovation, CMyLife, was developed in a multidisciplinary way and with active patient participation. "
3157,3,"The aim of developing CMyLife was to give patients the tools to monitor their results, interpret these results, and act on them. "
3158,3,"With this tool, they are provided with the know-how to consider their results in relation to their personal care process. "
3159,3,Whether CMyLife achieves its goal and the evaluation of the added value will be the focus of future studies. 
3160,3,CML could become the first malignancy for which patients are able to monitor and manage their disease by themselves.
3161,4,Sexual Behaviors and Violence in Pornography: Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis of Video Content Analyses
3162,0,"Owing to increasing access to Web-based pornography and concerns about its impact on viewers, many researchers have attempted to systematically analyze the content of pornography."
3163,1,"Inclusion criteria for article eligibility were (1) peer-reviewed publications, (2) articles in the English language, (3) articles describing a quantitative content analysis of video pornography, and (4) articles quantitatively examining at least one variable of interest."
3164,2,A total of 23 studies met the eligibility criteria. 
3165,2,Studies varied in scope and definitions of behavioral variables. 
3166,2,"Condom use was rare, although more commonly depicted in gay male pornography (36%-64% videos) compared with heterosexual pornography (2%-3% videos). "
3167,2,"Normative sexual behaviors were most frequently depicted in pornography samples (eg, vaginal intercourse in 48%-90% and fellatio in 52%-90% of heterosexual videos; fellatio in 66%-100% and anal intercourse in 70%-80% of gay male videos). "
3168,2,Extreme acts of violence (1%-3% videos) and rape (0%-6% videos) were relatively rare. 
3169,2,"However, more subtle forms of aggression, such as spanking (5%-75% videos), were more common, and unequal sexual relations (eg, domination) were also common. "
3170,2,"Although estimates varied by study, dominating and violent behaviors were nearly always directed toward women."
3171,3,"Condom nonuse and gender inequalities are common in pornography, which has implications for the development of healthy sexual relationships among pornography viewers. "
3172,3,"Higher quality research, including study replication and consistent methodological choices, is needed."
3173,4,Conversations and Medical News Frames on Twitter: Infodemiological Study on COVID-19 in South Korea
3174,0,"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) was spreading rapidly in South Korea at the end of February 2020 following its initial outbreak in China, making Korea the new center of global attention. "
3175,0,"The role of social media amid the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue. "
3176,0,Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations.
3177,1,"Korean COVID-19-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. "
3178,1,"Our final sample comprised of 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter. "
3179,1,We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding COVID-19 in Korea. 
3180,1,This study comparatively investigates how COVID-19-related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis. 
3181,1,"Next, we classified top news channels shared via tweets. "
3182,1,"Lastly, we conducted a content analysis of news frames used in the top-shared source s."
3183,2,"The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona-19, Shincheon, and Daegu). "
3184,2,"People who used the word ""Coronavims"" communicated more frequently with each other. "
3185,2,"The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms. "
3186,2,"Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers' attention to the crisis. "
3187,2,Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also emerged often. 
3188,2,There was a significant difference in the use of nonportal (n=14) and portal news (n=26) sites between the four network types. 
3189,2,"The news frames used in the top sources were similar across the networks (P=.89, 95% CI 0.004-0.006). "
3190,2,"Tweets containing medically framed news articles (mean 7.571, SD 1.988) were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting nonmedical frames (mean 5.060, SD 2.904; N=40, P=.03, 95% CI 0.169-4.852)."
3191,3,Most of the popular news on Twitter had nonmedical frames. 
3192,3,"Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about COVID-19 was greater than that of news with nonmedical frames. "
3193,3,"Social media network analytics cannot replace the work of public health officials; however, monitoring public conversations and media news that propagates rapidly can assist public health professionals in their complex and fast-paced decision-making processes."
3194,4,"Fiction, Falsehoods, and Few Facts: Cross-Sectional Study on the Content-Related Quality of Atopic Eczema-Related Videos on YouTube"
3195,0,"In recent years, YouTube has become a recognized source of medical information for health care consumers. "
3196,0,"Although YouTube has advantages in this context, there are potential dangers as videos may contain nonscientific, misleading, or even harmful information."
3197,1,The quality of the 100 most viewed AD videos was assessed by using the Global Quality Scale (GQS) and the DISCERN instrument. 
3198,1,"Videos were classified as ""useful,"" ""misleading,"" and ""potentially harmful,"" and the correlations of viewers' ratings (likes) with the GQS and DISCERN scores were assessed."
3199,2,"Among the 100 videos, 68.0% (68/100) and 62.0% (62/100) were of poor and very poor scientific quality, respectively. "
3200,2,"Additionally, 32.0% (32/100) of the videos were classified as useful, 48.0% (48/100) were classified as misleading, and 34.0% (34/100) were classified as potentially harmful. "
3201,2,Viewers' ratings did not correlate with the GQS and DISCERN scores. 
3202,2,"Overall, 50.0% (50/100) of the videos were posted by private individuals and promoters of complementary/alternative treatments, 42.0% (42/100) by therapeutical advertisers, and only 8.0% (8/100) by nonprofit organizations/universities."
3203,3,Our study demonstrated that two-thirds of the videos analyzed were below acceptable medical quality standards and that many videos were disseminating misleading or even dangerous content. 
3204,3,"Subjective and anecdotal content was over-represented, and viewers did not appear to be able to distinguish between high- and low-quality videos. "
3205,3,Health promotion strategies by professional medical organizations are needed to improve their presence and visibility on YouTube.
3206,4,The Relationship Between Engagement in Online Support Groups and Social Isolation Among Military Caregivers: Longitudinal Questionnaire Study
3207,0,"There is a lack of research on the effectiveness of online peer support groups for reducing social isolation and depressive symptoms among caregivers, and previous research has mixed results."
3208,1,We conducted a longitudinal study of 212 military caregivers who had newly joined an online community and those who were members of other military caregiver groups. 
3209,1,Multiple indicators of perceived social isolation and depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.
3210,2,"Compared with caregivers in the comparison group, caregivers who joined the new group experienced less perceived social isolation at 3 months (eg, number of caregivers in social network [unstandardized regression coefficients] b=0.49, SE 0.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.02), but this effect did not persist at 6 months. "
3211,2,"Those who engaged more with new or existing groups experienced less perceived social isolation over time (eg, number of caregivers in social network b=0.18, SE 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.27), and this relationship was mediated by increased interactions with other military caregivers (95% CI 0.0046 to 0.0961). "
3212,2,Engagement with an online group was not associated with improvements in depressive symptoms.
3213,3,"Online communities might help reduce social isolation when members engage with the group, but more intensive treatment is needed to improve depressive symptoms."
3214,4,Patient Perceptions of Video Visits Using Veterans Affairs Telehealth Tablets: Survey Study
3215,0,Video-based health care can help address access gaps for patients and is rapidly being offered by health care organizations. 
3216,0,"However, patients who lack access to technology may be left behind in these initiatives. "
3217,0,"In 2016, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) began distributing video-enabled tablets to provide video visits to veterans with health care access barriers."
3218,1,"A baseline survey was sent to the tablet recipients, and a follow-up survey was sent to the respondents 3 to 6 months later. "
3219,1,"Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify patient characteristics associated with preferences for care, and we examined qualitative themes around care preferences using standard content analysis methods for coding the data collected in the open-ended questions."
3220,2,"Patient-reported access barriers centered around transportation and health-related challenges, outside commitments, and feeling uncomfortable or uneasy at the VA. "
3221,2,"Satisfaction with the tablet program was high, and in the follow-up survey, approximately two-thirds of tablet recipients preferred care via a tablet (194/604, 32.1%) or expressed that video-based and in-person care were ""about the same"" (216/604, 35.7%), whereas one-third (192/604, 31.7%) indicated a preference for in-person care. "
3222,2,"Patients were significantly more likely to report a preference for video visits (vs a preference for in-person visits or rating them ""about the same"") if they felt uncomfortable in a VA setting, reported a collaborative communication style with their doctor, had a substance use disorder diagnosis, or lived in a place with better broadband coverage. "
3223,2,Patients were less likely to report a preference for video visits if they had more chronic conditions. 
3224,2,"Qualitative analyses identified four themes related to preferences for video-based care: perceived improvements in access to care, perceived differential quality of care, feasibility of obtaining necessary care, and technology-related challenges."
3225,3,Many recipients of VA-issued tablets report that video care is equivalent to or preferred to in-person care. 
3226,3,Results may inform efforts to identify good candidates for virtual care and interventions to support individuals who experience technical challenges.
3227,4,Epidemiological Characterization of a Directed and Weighted Disease Network Using Data From a Cohort of One Million Patients: Network Analysis
3228,0,"In the past 20 years, various methods have been introduced to construct disease networks. "
3229,0,"However, established disease networks have not been clinically useful to date because of differences among demographic factors, as well as the temporal order and intensity among disease-disease associations."
3230,1,"We used National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) data from the Republic of Korea, which included the time series insurance information of 1 million out of 50 million Korean (approximately 2%) patients obtained between 2002 and 2013. "
3231,1,"After setting the observation and outcome periods, we selected only 520 common Korean Classification of Disease, sixth revision codes that were the most prevalent diagnoses, making up approximately 80% of the cases, for statistical validity. "
3232,1,"Using these data, we constructed a directional and weighted temporal network that considered both demographic factors and network properties."
3233,2,"Our disease network contained 294 nodes and 3085 edges, a relative risk value of more than 4, and a false discovery rate-adjusted P value of <.001. "
3234,2,"Interestingly, our network presented four large clusters. "
3235,2,Analysis of the network topology revealed a stronger correlation between in-strength and out-strength than between in-degree and out-degree. 
3236,2,"Further, the mean age of each disease population was related to the position along the regression line of the out/in-strength plot. "
3237,2,"Conversely, clustering analysis suggested that our network boasted four large clusters with different sex, age, and disease categories."
3238,3,We constructed a directional and weighted disease network visualizing demographic factors. 
3239,3,Our proposed disease network model is expected to be a valuable tool for use by early clinical researchers seeking to explore the relationships among diseases in the future.
3240,4,The Association of Therapeutic Alliance With Long-Term Outcome in a Guided Internet Intervention for Depression: Secondary Analysis From a Randomized Control Trial
3241,0,Therapeutic alliance has been well established as a robust predictor of face-to-face psychotherapy outcomes. 
3242,0,"Although initial evidence positioned alliance as a relevant predictor of internet intervention success, some conceptual and methodological concerns were raised regarding the methods and instruments used to measure the alliance in internet interventions and its association with outcomes."
3243,1,"A sample of 223 adult participants with moderate depression received an internet intervention (ie, Deprexis) and email support. "
3244,1,They completed the Working Alliance Inventory for Guided Internet Intervention (WAI-I) and a measure of treatment satisfaction at treatment termination and measures of depression severity and well-being at termination and 3- and 9-month follow-ups. 
3245,1,"For data analysis, we used two-level hierarchical linear modeling that included two subscales of the WAI-I (ie, tasks and goals agreement with the program and bond with the supporting therapist) as predictors of the estimated values of the outcome variables at the end of follow-up and their rate of change during the follow-up period. "
3246,1,The same models were also used controlling for the effect of patient satisfaction with treatment.
3247,2,"We found significant effects of the tasks and goals subscale of the WAI-I on the estimated values of residual depressive symptoms (gamma(02 )=-1.74, standard error SE=0.40, 95% CI -2.52 to -0.96, t(206) -4.37, P<.001) and patient well-being (gamma(02 ) =3.10, SE=1.14, 95% CI 0.87-5.33, t(198) =2.72, P=.007) at the end of follow-up. "
3248,2,A greater score in this subscale was related to lower levels of residual depressive symptoms and a higher level of well-being. 
3249,2,"However, there were no significant effects of the tasks and goals subscale on the rate of change in these variables during follow-up (depressive symptoms, P=.48; patient well-being, P=.26). "
3250,2,"The effects of the bond subscale were also nonsignificant when predicting the estimated values of depressive symptoms and well at the end of follow-up and the rate of change during that period (depressive symptoms, P=.08; patient well-being, P=.68)."
3251,3,The results of this study point out the importance of attuning internet interventions to patients' expectations and preferences in order to enhance their agreement with the tasks and goals of the treatment. 
3252,3,"Thus, the results support the notion that responsiveness to a patient's individual needs is crucial also in internet interventions. "
3253,3,"Nevertheless, these findings need to be replicated to establish if they can be generalized to different diagnostic groups, internet interventions, and supporting formats."
3254,4,Implementing a Digital Tool to Support Shared Care Planning in Community-Based Mental Health Services: Qualitative Evaluation
3255,0,"Mental health services aim to provide recovery-focused care and facilitate coproduced care planning In practice, mental health providers can find supporting individualized coproduced care with service users difficult while balancing administrative and performance demands. "
3256,0,"To help meet this aim and using principles of coproduction, an innovative mobile digital care pathway tool (CPT) was developed to be used on a tablet computer and piloted in the West of England."
3257,1,A total of 20 in-depth telephone interviews were conducted with providers participating in the pilot and managers in the host organization. 
3258,1,"Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, anonymized, and thematically analyzed guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research."
3259,2,"The tool was thought to facilitate coproduced recovery-focused care planning, a policy and organizational as well as professional priority. "
3260,2,"Internet connectivity issues, system interoperability, and access to service users' health records affected use of the tool during mobile working. "
3261,2,"The organization's resources, such as information technology (IT) infrastructure and staff time and IT culture, influenced implementation. "
3262,2,Participants' levels of use of the tool were dependent on knowledge of the tool and self-efficacy; perceived service-user needs and characteristics; and perceptions of impact on the therapeutic relationship. 
3263,2,Training and preparation time influenced participants' confidence in using the tool.
3264,3,"Findings highlight the importance of congruence between staff, organization, and external policy priorities and digital technologies in aiding intervention engagement, and the need for ongoing training and support of those intended to use the technology during and after the end of implementation interventions."
3265,4,Understanding How Virtual Reality Can Support Mindfulness Practice: Mixed Methods Study
3266,0,"Regular mindfulness practice has been demonstrated to be beneficial for mental health, but mindfulness can be challenging to adopt, with environmental and personal distractors often cited as challenges. "
3267,0,Virtual reality (VR) may address these challenges by providing an immersive environment for practicing mindfulness and by supporting the user to orient attention to the present moment within a tailored virtual setting. 
3268,0,"However, there is currently a limited understanding of the ways in which VR can support or hinder mindfulness practice. "
3269,0,Such an understanding is required to design effective VR apps while ensuring that VR-supported mindfulness is acceptable to end users.
3270,1,A sample of 37 participants from the general population trialed a VR mindfulness app in a controlled laboratory setting. 
3271,1,The VR app presented users with an omnidirectional video of a peaceful forest environment with a guided mindfulness voiceover that was delivered by a male narrator. 
3272,1,"Scores on the State Mindfulness Scale, Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, and single-item measures of positive and negative emotion and arousal were measured pre- and post-VR for all participants. "
3273,1,Qualitative feedback was collected through interviews with a subset of 19 participants. 
3274,1,The interviews sought to understand the user experience of mindfulness practice in VR.
3275,2,State mindfulness (P<.001; Cohen d=1.80) and positive affect (P=.006; r=.45) significantly increased after using the VR mindfulness app. 
3276,2,"No notable changes in negative emotion, subjective arousal, or symptoms of simulator sickness were observed across the sample. "
3277,2,"Participants described the user experience as relaxing, calming, and peaceful. "
3278,2,Participants suggested that the use of VR helped them to focus on the present moment by using visual and auditory elements of VR as attentional anchors. 
3279,2,The sense of presence in the virtual environment (VE) was identified by participants as being helpful to practicing mindfulness. 
3280,2,Interruptions to presence acted as distractors. 
3281,2,"Some uncomfortable experiences were discussed, primarily in relation to video fidelity and the weight of the VR headset, although these were infrequent and minor."
3282,3,This study suggests that an appropriately designed VR app can support mindfulness practice by enhancing state mindfulness and inducing positive affect. 
3283,3,VR may help address the challenges of practicing mindfulness by creating a sense of presence in a tailored VE; by allowing users to attend to visual and auditory anchors of their choice; and by reducing the scope of the content in users' mind-wandering. 
3284,3,VR has the unique capability to combine guided mindfulness practice with tailored VEs that lend themselves to support individuals to focus attention on the present moment.
3285,4,Four-Year Trends in Sleep Duration and Quality: A Longitudinal Study Using Data from a Commercially Available Sleep Tracker
3286,0,Population estimates of sleep duration and quality are inconsistent because they rely primarily on self-reported data. 
3287,0,Passive and ubiquitous digital tracking and wearable devices may provide more accurate estimates of sleep duration and quality.
3288,1,"We examined sleep duration and quality using 2,161,067 nights of data captured from 2015 to 2018 by Sleep Cycle, a popular sleep-tracking app. "
3289,1,"In this analysis, we explored differences in sleep parameters based on demographic factors, including age and sex. "
3290,1,"We used graphical matrix representations of data (heat maps) and geospatial analyses to compare sleep duration (in hours) and sleep quality (based on time in bed, deep sleep time, sleep consistency, and number of times fully awake), considering potential effects of day of the week and seasonality."
3291,2,"Women represented 46.43% (1,003,421/2,161,067) of the sample, and men represented 53.57% (1,157,646/2,161,067) of individuals in the sample. "
3292,2,The average age of the sample was 31.0 years (SD 10.6). 
3293,2,The mean sleep duration of the total sample was 7.11 hours (SD 1.4). 
3294,2,"Women slept longer on average (mean 7.27 hours, SD 1.4) than men (mean 7 hours, SD 1.3; P<.001). "
3295,2,Trend analysis indicated longer sleep duration and higher sleep quality among older individuals than among younger (P<.001). 
3296,2,"On average, sleep duration was longer on the weekend nights (mean 7.19 hours, SD 1.5) than on weeknights (mean 7.09 hours, SD 1.3; P<.001)."
3297,3,"Our study of data from a commercially available sleep tracker showed that women experienced longer sleep duration and higher sleep quality in nearly every age group than men, and a low proportion of young adults obtained the recommended sleep duration. "
3298,3,Future research may compare sleep measures obtained via wearable sleep trackers with validated research-grade measures of sleep.
3299,4,A Physician-Completed Digital Tool for Evaluating Disease Progression (Multiple Sclerosis Progression Discussion Tool): Validation Study
3300,0,Defining the transition from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) can be challenging and delayed. 
3301,0,"A digital tool (MSProDiscuss) was developed to facilitate physician-patient discussion in evaluating early, subtle signs of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease progression representing this transition."
3302,1,Experienced neurologists completed the tool for patients with confirmed RRMS or SPMS and those suspected to be transitioning to SPMS. 
3303,1,"In addition to age and EDSS score, each patient's current disease status (disease activity, symptoms, and its impacts on daily life) was collected while completing the draft tool. "
3304,1,Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined optimal cut-off values (sensitivity and specificity) for the classification of RRMS and SPMS.
3305,2,Twenty neurologists completed the draft tool for 198 patients. 
3306,2,"Mean scores for patients with RRMS (n=89), transitioning to SPMS (n=47), and SPMS (n=62) were 38.1 (SD 12.5), 55.2 (SD 11.1), and 69.6 (SD 12.0), respectively (P<.001, each between-groups comparison). "
3307,2,"Area under the ROC curve (AUC) including and excluding EDSS were for RRMS (including) AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.95, RRMS (excluding) AUC 0.88, 95% CI 0.84-0.93, SPMS (including) AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.95, and SPMS (excluding) AUC 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.91. "
3308,2,"In the algorithm with EDSS, the optimal cut-off values were <= 51.6 for RRMS patients (sensitivity=0.83; specificity=0.82) and >= 58.9 for SPMS patients (sensitivity=0.82; specificity=0.84). "
3309,2,The optimal cut-offs without EDSS were <= 46.3 and >= 57.8 and resulted in similar high sensitivity and specificity (0.76-0.86). 
3310,2,The draft tool showed excellent interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=.95).
3311,3,The MSProDiscuss tool differentiated RRMS patients from SPMS patients with high sensitivity and specificity. 
3312,3,"In clinical practice, it may be a useful tool to evaluate early, subtle signs of MS disease progression indicating the evolution of RRMS to SPMS. "
3313,3,MSProDiscuss will help assess the current level of progression in an individual patient and facilitate a more informed physician-patient discussion.
3314,4,"Closing the Digital Divide in Speech, Language, and Cognitive Therapy: Cohort Study of the Factors Associated With Technology Usage for Rehabilitation"
3315,0,"For stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and other neurologic conditions associated with speech-language disorders, speech and language therapy is the standard of care for promoting recovery. "
3316,0,"However, barriers such as clinician time constraints and insurance reimbursement can inhibit a patient's ability to receive the support needed to optimize functional gain. "
3317,0,"Although digital rehabilitation has the potential to increase access to therapy by allowing patients to practice at home, the clinical and demographic characteristics that impact a patient's level of engagement with technology-based therapy are currently unknown."
3318,1,"Data for patients with stroke or TBI that initiated the use of Constant Therapy, a remotely delivered, cloud-based rehabilitation program for patients with speech-language disorders, were retrospectively analyzed. "
3319,1,Only data from therapeutic sessions completed at home were included. 
3320,1,"The following three activity metrics were evaluated: (1) the number of active weeks of therapy, (2) the average number of active therapy days per week, and (3) the total number of therapeutic sessions completed during the first 20 weeks of program access. "
3321,1,An active day or week was defined as having at least one completed therapeutic session. 
3322,1,Separate multiple linear regression models were performed with each activity measure as the dependent variable and all available patient demographics as model covariates.
3323,2,"Data for 2850 patients with stroke or TBI were analyzed, with the average patient completing 8.6 weeks of therapy at a frequency of 1.5 days per week. "
3324,2,"Contrary to known barriers to technological adoption, older patients were more active during their first 20 weeks of program access, with those aged 51 to 70 years completing 5.01 more sessions than patients aged 50 years or younger (P=.04). "
3325,2,"Similarly, patients living in a rural area, who face greater barriers to clinic access, were more digitally engaged than their urban counterparts, with rural patients completing 11.54 more (P=.001) sessions during their first 20 weeks of access, after controlling for other model covariates."
3326,3,An evaluation of real-world data demonstrated that patients with stroke and TBI use digital therapy frequently for cognitive and language rehabilitation at home. 
3327,3,"Usage was higher in areas with limited access to clinical services and was unaffected by typical barriers to technological adoption, such as age. "
3328,3,"These findings will help guide the direction of future research in digital rehabilitation therapy, including the impact of demographics on recovery outcomes and the design of large, randomized controlled trials."
3329,4,You Get What You Pay for on Health Care Question and Answer Platforms: Nonparticipant Observational Study
3330,0,Seeking health information on the internet is very popular despite the debatable ability of lay users to evaluate the quality of health information and uneven quality of information available on the Web. 
3331,0,"Consulting the internet for health information is pervasive, particularly when other sources are inaccessible because of time, distance, and money constraints or when sensitive or embarrassing questions are to be explored. "
3332,0,Question and answer (Q&A) platforms are Web-based services that provide personalized health advice upon the information seekers' request. 
3333,0,"However, it is not clear how the quality of health advices is ensured on these platforms."
3334,1,A total of 900 Q&As were collected from 9 Q&A platforms with different design features. 
3335,1,Data on the design features for each platform were generated. 
3336,1,Paid physicians evaluated the data to quantify the quality of health advices. 
3337,1,"Guided by the literature, the design features that affected information quality were identified and recorded for each Q&A platform. "
3338,1,The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and unbiased regression tree methods were used for the analysis.
3339,2,Q&A platform design and health advice quality were related. 
3340,2,"Expertise of information providers (beta=.48; P=.001), financial incentive (beta=.4; P=.001), external reputation (beta=.28; P=.002), and question quality (beta=.12; P=.001) best predicted health advice quality. "
3341,2,"Virtual incentive, Web 2.0 mechanisms, and reputation systems were not associated with health advice quality."
3342,3,Access to high-quality health advices on the internet is unequal and skewed toward high-income and high-literacy groups. 
3343,3,"However, there are possibilities to generate high-quality health advices for free."
3344,4,Efficacy of a Self-Help Web-Based Recovery Training in Improving Sleep in Workers: Randomized Controlled Trial in the General Working Population
3345,0,"Sleep complaints are among the most prevalent health concerns, especially among workers, which may lead to adverse effects on health and work. "
3346,0,Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) offers the opportunity to deliver effective solutions on a large scale. 
3347,0,"The efficacy of iCBT-I for clinical samples has been demonstrated in recent meta-analyses, and there is evidence that iCBT-I is effective in the working population with severe sleep complaints. "
3348,0,"However, to date, there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials that iCBT-I could also be an effective tool for universal prevention among the general working population regardless of symptom severity. "
3349,0,"Although increasing evidence suggests that negatively toned cognitive activity may be a key factor for the development and maintenance of insomnia, little is known about how iCBT-I improves sleep by reducing presleep cognitive activity."
3350,1,A sample of 177 workers were randomized to receive either the iCBT-I (n=88) or controls (n=89). 
3351,1,The intervention is a Web-based training consisting of six 1-week modules. 
3352,1,"As the training was self-help, participants received nothing but technical support via email Web-based self-report assessments were scheduled at baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 6 months following randomization. "
3353,1,The primary outcome was insomnia severity. 
3354,1,Secondary outcomes included measures of mental health and work-related health and cognitive activity. 
3355,1,"In an exploratory analysis, general and work-related cognitive activities, measured as worry and work-related rumination, were investigated as mediators."
3356,2,"Analysis of the linear mixed effects model showed that, relative to controls, participants who received iCBT-I reported significantly lower insomnia severity scores at postintervention (between-group mean difference -4.36; 95% CI -5.59 to - 3.03; Cohen d=0.97) and at 6-month follow-up (between-group difference: -3.64; 95% CI -4.89 to -2.39; Cohen d=0.86). "
3357,2,The overall test of group-by-time interaction was significant (P<.001). 
3358,2,"Significant differences, with small-to-large effect sizes, were also detected for cognitive activity and for mental and work-related health, but not for absenteeism. "
3359,2,Mediation analysis demonstrated that work-related rumination (indirect effect: a(1)b(1) =-0.80; SE=0.34; 95% boot CI -1.59 to -0.25) and worry (indirect effect: a(2)b(2) =-0.37; SE=0.19; 95% boot CI -0.85 to -0.09) mediate the intervention's effect on sleep.
3360,3,"A self-help Web-based recovery training, grounded in the principles of iCBT-I, can be effective in the general working population, both short and long term. "
3361,3,"Work-related rumination may be a particularly crucial mediator of the intervention's effect, suggesting that tailoring interventions to the workplace, including components to reduce the work-related cognitive activity, might be important when designing recovery interventions for workers."
3362,4,An Electronic Screening and Brief Intervention for Hazardous and Harmful Drinking Among Swedish University Students: Reanalysis of Findings From a Randomized Controlled Trial Using a Bayesian Framework
3363,0,"During the past decade, student health care centers across Sweden have routinely invited all students they serve to complete an electronic screening and brief intervention (eSBI) targeting harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption. "
3364,0,The second Alcohol Email Assessment and Feedback Study Dismantling Effectiveness for University Students (AMADEUS-2) trial aimed to assess the effect of an eSBI on alcohol consumption among students who were harmful and hazardous drinkers. 
3365,0,"A two-arm randomized controlled trial design was employed, randomizing eligible participants to either a waiting list or direct access to an eSBI. "
3366,0,Follow-up assessments were conducted 2 months after randomization. 
3367,0,"Subsequent analysis of the trial followed the conventional null hypothesis approach, and no statistical significance was found between groups at follow-up with respect to the number of standard drinks consumed weekly. "
3368,0,"However, in an unspecified sensitivity analysis, it was discovered that removing three potential outliers made the difference between the groups significant."
3369,1,The same regression models used in the original analysis were employed in this reanalysis (negative binomial regression). 
3370,1,Model parameters were given uniform priors. 
3371,1,"Markov chain Monte Carlo was used for Bayesian inference, and posterior probabilities were calculated for prespecified thresholds of interest."
3372,2,"Null hypothesis tests did not identify a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups, potentially due to a few extreme data points. "
3373,2,The Bayesian analysis indicated a 93.6% probability that there was a difference in grams of alcohol consumed at follow-up between the intervention and control groups and a 71.5% probability that the incidence rate ratio was <0.96. 
3374,2,"Posterior probabilities increased when excluding three potential outliers, yet such post hoc analyses were not necessary to show the preference toward offering an eSBI to harmful and hazardous drinkers among university students."
3375,3,The null hypothesis framework relies on point estimates of parameters. 
3376,3,"P values can therefore swing heavily, depending on a single or few data points alone, casting doubt on the value of the analysis. "
3377,3,Bayesian analysis results in a distribution over parameter values and is therefore less sensitive to outliers and extreme values. 
3378,3,Results from analyses of trials of interventions where small-to-modest effect sizes are expected can be more robust in a Bayesian framework.
3379,4,"Conversational Interfaces for Health: Bibliometric Analysis of Grants, Publications, and Patents"
3380,0,"Conversational interfaces (CIs) in different modalities have been developed for health purposes, such as health behavioral intervention, patient self-management, and clinical decision support. "
3381,0,"Despite growing research evidence supporting CIs' potential, CI-related research is still in its infancy. "
3382,0,"There is a lack of systematic investigation that goes beyond publication review and presents the state of the art from perspectives of funding agencies, academia, and industry by incorporating CI-related public funding and patent activities."
3383,1,A multifaceted search query was executed to retrieve records from 9 databases. 
3384,1,"Bibliometric analysis, social network analysis, and term co-occurrence analysis were conducted on the screened records."
3385,2,"This review included 42 funded projects, 428 research publications, and 162 patents. "
3386,2,"The total dollar amount of grants awarded was US $30,297,932, of which US $13,513,473 was awarded by US funding agencies and US $16,784,459 was funded by the Europe Commission. "
3387,2,"The top 3 funding agencies in the United States were the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. "
3388,2,"Boston Medical Center was awarded the largest combined grant size (US $2,246,437) for 4 projects. "
3389,2,"The authors of the publications were from 58 countries and 566 organizations; the top 3 most productive organizations were Northeastern University (United States), Universiti Teknologi MARA (Malaysia), and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS; France). "
3390,2,US researchers produced 114 publications. 
3391,2,"Although 82.0% (464/566) of the organizations engaged in interorganizational collaboration, 2 organizational research-collaboration clusters were observed with Northeastern University and CNRS as the central nodes. "
3392,2,About 112 organizations from the United States and China filed 87.7% patents. 
3393,2,IBM filed most patents (N=17). 
3394,2,"Only 5 patents were co-owned by different organizations, and there was no across-country collaboration on patenting activity. "
3395,2,"The terms patient, child, elderly, and robot were frequently discussed in the 3 record types. "
3396,2,The terms related to mental and chronic issues were discussed mainly in grants and publications. 
3397,2,The terms regarding multimodal interactions were widely mentioned as users' communication modes with CIs in the identified records.
3398,3,"Our findings provided an overview of the countries, organizations, and topic terms in funded projects, as well as the authorship, collaboration, content, and related information of research publications and patents. "
3399,3,"There is a lack of broad cross-sector partnerships among grant agencies, academia, and industry, particularly in the United States. "
3400,3,Our results suggest a need to improve collaboration among public and private sectors and health care organizations in research and patent activities.
3401,4,Patients Use of the Internet to Find Reliable Medical Information About Minor Ailments: Vignette-Based Experimental Study
3402,0,Little is known about the exact process of how patients search for medical information on the internet and what they retrieve. 
3403,0,"There is especially a paucity of literature on browsing for information on minor ailments, a term used for harmless diseases that are very common in the general population and thus have a significant impact on health care."
3404,1,"Out of 1372 survey participants, 355 were randomly sampled, and 155 of them were recruited and assigned to one of four clinical scenarios. "
3405,1,"Each search term they used was classified as one of three search strategies: (1) hypothesis testing, (2) narrowing within the general hypothesis area, and (3) symptom exploration. "
3406,1,The quality of the websites used was determined by using the DISCERN instrument. 
3407,1,"To compare the diagnostic accuracy of the participants before and after the internet search, a McNemar test was used. "
3408,1,Chi-square tests were used to describe which factors are related to the chosen search strategy. 
3409,1,A multivariate binary logistic regression model was constructed to predict which factors are related to finding a sound diagnosis after searching the internet for health information.
3410,2,"Most participants (65.8%, 102/155) used the symptom exploration strategy. "
3411,2,"However, this depends on the assigned scenario (P<.001) and the self-estimated severity score of the symptoms before the internet search (P=.001). "
3412,2,"A significant relation was found between choosing an accurate diagnosis and age (odds ratio [OR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98) and the clinical scenario, as well as the use of high-quality websites (OR 7.49, 95% CI 1.85 to 30.26). "
3413,2,"Browsing the internet did not lead to a statistically significant change in participants' beliefs about the severity of the condition (McNemar test, P=.85). "
3414,2,Most participants (65%) shared their retrieved information with their physician and most of them (75%) received a positive response.
3415,3,"Our findings suggest that most patients use a symptom-based approach; however, if patients expect the potential diagnosis to be severe, they tend to use a hypothesis verification strategy more often and are therefore prone to certain forms of bias. "
3416,3,"In addition, self-diagnosing accuracy is related to younger age, the symptom scenario, and the use of high-quality websites. "
3417,3,We should find ways to guide patients toward search strategies and websites that may more likely lead to accurate decision making.
3418,4,The Personalization of Conversational Agents in Health Care: Systematic Review
3419,0,"The personalization of conversational agents with natural language user interfaces is seeing increasing use in health care applications, shaping the content, structure, or purpose of the dialogue between humans and conversational agents."
3420,1,"We searched on PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital Library using a predefined search strategy. "
3421,1,"The studies were included if they: (1) were primary research studies that focused on consumers, caregivers, or health care professionals; (2) involved a conversational agent with an unconstrained natural language interface; (3) tested the system with human subjects; and (4) implemented personalization features."
3422,2,The search found 1958 publications. 
3423,2,"After abstract and full-text screening, 13 studies were included in the review. "
3424,2,"Common examples of personalized content included feedback, daily health reports, alerts, warnings, and recommendations. "
3425,2,The personalization features were implemented without a theoretical framework of customization and with limited evaluation of its impact. 
3426,2,"While conversational agents with personalization features were reported to improve user satisfaction, user engagement and dialogue quality, the role of personalization in improving health outcomes was not assessed directly."
3427,3,Most of the studies in our review implemented the personalization features without theoretical or evidence-based support for them and did not leverage the recent developments in other domains of personalization. 
3428,3,"Future research could incorporate personalization as a distinct design factor with a more careful consideration of its impact on health outcomes and its implications on patient safety, privacy, and decision-making."
3429,4,Modeling Research Topics for Artificial Intelligence Applications in Medicine: Latent Dirichlet Allocation Application Study
3430,0,Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies develop rapidly and have myriad applications in medicine and health care. 
3431,0,"However, there is a lack of comprehensive reporting on the productivity, workflow, topics, and research landscape of AI in this field."
3432,1,We obtained bibliographic data and abstract contents of publications published between 1977 and 2018 from the Web of Science database. 
3433,1,"A total of 27,451 eligible articles were analyzed. "
3434,1,"Research topics were classified by latent Dirichlet allocation, and principal component analysis was used to identify the construct of the research landscape."
3435,2,"The applications of AI have mainly impacted clinical settings (enhanced prognosis and diagnosis, robot-assisted surgery, and rehabilitation), data science and precision medicine (collecting individual data for precision medicine), and policy making (raising ethical and legal issues, especially regarding privacy and confidentiality of data). "
3436,2,"However, AI applications have not been commonly used in resource-poor settings due to the limit in infrastructure and human resources."
3437,3,"The application of AI in medicine has grown rapidly and focuses on three leading platforms: clinical practices, clinical material, and policies. "
3438,3,AI might be one of the methods to narrow down the inequality in health care and medicine between developing and developed countries. 
3439,3,Technology transfer and support from developed countries are essential measures for the advancement of AI application in health care in developing countries.
3440,4,Public Concern About Monitoring Twitter Users and Their Conversations to Recruit for Clinical Trials: Survey Study
3441,0,Social networks such as Twitter offer the clinical research community a novel opportunity for engaging potential study participants based on user activity data. 
3442,0,"However, the availability of public social media data has led to new ethical challenges about respecting user privacy and the appropriateness of monitoring social media for clinical trial recruitment. "
3443,0,Researchers have voiced the need for involving users' perspectives in the development of ethical norms and regulations.
3444,1,"We used two online methods for recruiting study participants: the open survey was (1) advertised on Twitter between May 23 and June 8, 2017, and (2) deployed on TurkPrime, a crowdsourcing data acquisition platform, between May 23 and June 8, 2017. "
3445,1,"Eligible participants were adults, 18 years of age or older, who lived in the United States. "
3446,1,People with and without Twitter accounts were included in the study.
3447,2,"While nearly half the respondents-on Twitter (94/603, 15.6%) and on TurkPrime (509/603, 84.4%)-indicated agreement that social media monitoring constitutes a form of eavesdropping that invades their privacy, over one-third disagreed and nearly 1 in 5 had no opinion. "
3448,2,A chi-square test revealed a positive relationship between respondents' general privacy concern and their average concern about Internet research (P<.005). 
3449,2,We found associations between respondents' Twitter literacy and their concerns about the ability for researchers to monitor their Twitter activity for clinical trial recruitment (P=.001) and whether they consider Twitter monitoring for clinical trial recruitment as eavesdropping (P<.001) and an invasion of privacy (P=.003). 
3450,2,"As Twitter literacy increased, so did people's concerns about researchers monitoring Twitter activity. "
3451,2,"Our data support the previously suggested use of the nonexceptionalist methodology for assessing social media in research, insofar as social media-based recruitment does not need to be considered exceptional and, for most, it is considered preferable to traditional in-person interventions at physical clinics. "
3452,2,"The expressed attitudes were highly contextual, depending on factors such as the type of disease or health topic (eg, HIV/AIDS vs obesity vs smoking), the entity or person monitoring users on Twitter, and the monitored information."
3453,3,The data and findings from this study contribute to the critical dialogue with the public about the use of social media in clinical research. 
3454,3,The findings suggest that most users do not think that monitoring Twitter for clinical trial recruitment constitutes inappropriate surveillance or a violation of privacy. 
3455,3,"However, researchers should remain mindful that some participants might find social media monitoring problematic when connected with certain conditions or health topics. "
3456,3,Further research should isolate factors that influence the level of concern among social media users across platforms and populations and inform the development of more clear and consistent guidelines.
3457,4,Methodological Challenges in Randomized Controlled Trials on Smartphone-Based Treatment in Psychiatry: Systematic Review
3458,0,"Smartphone-based technology is developing at high speed, and many apps offer potential new ways of monitoring and treating a range of psychiatric disorders and symptoms. "
3459,0,"However, the effects of most available apps have not been scientifically investigated. "
3460,0,"Within medicine, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the standard method for providing the evidence of effects. "
3461,0,"However, their rigidity and long time frame may contrast with the field of information technology research. "
3462,0,"Therefore, a systematic review of methodological challenges in designing and conducting RCTs within mobile health is needed."
3463,1,"A systematic search in English was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE up to August 12, 2019. "
3464,1,The search terms were (1) psychiatric disorders in broad term and for specific disorders AND (2) smartphone or app AND (3) RCT. 
3465,1,The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials electronic health guidelines were used as a template for data extraction. 
3466,1,"The focus was on trial design, method, and reporting. "
3467,1,"Only trials having sufficient information on diagnosis and acceptable diagnostic procedures, having a smartphone as a central part of treatment, and using an RCT design were included."
3468,2,A total of 27 trials comprising 3312 patients within a range of psychiatric diagnoses were included. 
3469,2,"Among them, 2 trials were concerning drug or alcohol abuse, 3 psychosis, 10 affective disorders, 9 anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder, 1 eating disorder, and 1 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. "
3470,2,"In addition, 1 trial used a cross-diagnostic design, 7 trials included patients with a clinical diagnosis that was subsequently assessed and validated by the researchers, and 11 trials had a sample size above 100. "
3471,2,"Generally, large between-trial heterogeneity and multiple approaches to patient recruitment, diagnostic procedures, trial design, comparator, outcome measures, and analyses were identified. "
3472,2,Only 5 trials published a trial protocol. 
3473,2,"Furthermore, 1 trial provided information regarding technological updates, and only 18 trials reported on the conflicts of interest. "
3474,2,No trial addressed the ethical aspects of using smartphones in treatment.
3475,3,This first systematic review of the methodological challenges in designing and conducting RCTs investigating smartphone-based treatment in psychiatric patients suggests an increasing number of trials but with a lower quality compared with classic medical RCTs. 
3476,3,Heterogeneity and methodological issues in individual trials limit the evidence. 
3477,3,Methodological recommendations are presented.
3478,4,A Comparison of Users and Nonusers of a Web-Based Intervention for Carers of Older Persons With Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias: Mixed Methods Secondary Analysis
3479,0,A self-administered Web-based intervention was developed to help carers of persons with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) and multiple chronic conditions (MCC) deal with the significant transitions they experience. 
3480,0,"The intervention, My Tools 4 Care (MT4C), was evaluated during a pragmatic mixed methods randomized controlled trial with 199 carers. "
3481,0,"Those in the intervention group received free, password-protected access to MT4C for three months. "
3482,0,MT4C was found to increase hope in participants at three months compared with the control group. 
3483,0,"However, in the intervention group, 22% (20/92) did not use MT4C at all during the three-month period."
3484,1,Data from the treatment group of a pragmatic mixed methods randomized controlled trial were used. 
3485,1,"Through audiotaped telephone interviews, trained research assistants collected data on participants' hope (Herth Hope Index; HHI), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale; GSES), and HRQOL (Short-Form 12-item health survey version 2; SF-12v2) at baseline, one month, and three months. "
3486,1,Treatment group participants also provided feedback on MT4C through qualitative telephone interviews at one month and three months. 
3487,1,"Analysis of covariance was used to determine differences at three months, and generalized estimating equations were used to determine significant differences in HHI, GSES, and SF-12v2 between users and nonusers of MT4C from baseline to three months Interview data were analyzed using content analysis and integrated with quantitative data at the result stage."
3488,2,"Of the 101 participants at baseline, 9 (9%) withdrew from the study, leaving 92 participants at three months of which 72 (78%) used MT4C at least once; 20 (22%) participants did not use it at all. "
3489,2,"At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics and in outcome variables (HHI, GSES, and SF-12v2 mental component score and physical component score) between users and nonusers. "
3490,2,"At three months, participants who used MT4C at least once during the three-month period (users) reported higher mean GSES scores (P=.003) than nonusers. "
3491,2,"Over time, users had significantly higher GSES scores than nonusers (P=.048). "
3492,2,"Reasons for nonuse of MT4C included the following: caregiving demands, problems accessing MT4C (poor connectivity, computer literacy, and navigation of MT4C), and preferences (for paper format or face-to-face interaction)."
3493,3,"Web-based interventions, such as MT4C, have the potential to increase the self-efficacy of carers of persons with ADRD and MCC. "
3494,3,Future research with MT4C should consider including educational programs for computer literacy and providing alternate ways to access MT4C in addition to Web-based access.
3495,4,Using Patient and Family Engagement Strategies to Improve Outcomes of Health Information Technology Initiatives: Scoping Review
3496,0,"Many health care organizations around the world have implemented health information technologies (ITs) to enhance health service efficiency, effectiveness, and safety. "
3497,0,"Studies have demonstrated that promising outcomes of health IT initiatives can be obtained when patients and family members participate and engage in the adoption, use, and evaluation of these technologies. "
3498,0,"Despite knowing this, there is a lack of health care organizations using patient and family engagement strategies to enhance the use and adoption of health ITs, specifically."
3499,1,This scoping review used a five-step framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and adapted by Levac et al. 
3500,1,"These steps include the following: (1) identifying the RQ, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) selecting studies, (4) charting relevant data, and (5) summarizing and reporting the result. "
3501,1,Retrieved academic and grey literature records were evaluated using a literature review software based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. 
3502,1,"If consensus was not achieved, two reviewers would resolve conflicts by discussion. "
3503,1,Research findings and strategies were extracted from the studies and summarized in data tables.
3504,2,A total of 35 academic articles and 23 gray literature documents met the inclusion criteria. 
3505,2,"In total, 20 of the 35 included studies have been published since 2017. "
3506,2,Frameworks found include the patient engagement framework developed by Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society and the patient and family engagement framework proposed by Carman et al. 
3507,2,Effective strategies include providing patients with clear expectations and responsibilities and providing reimbursement for time and travel. 
3508,2,"The gray literature sources outlined key considerations for planning and supporting engagement initiatives such as providing patients with professional development opportunities, and embedding patients in existing governance structures."
3509,3,Several studies have reported their findings regarding successful strategies to engage patients and family members in health IT initiatives and the positive impact that can emerge when patients and family members are engaged in such initiatives in an effective manner. 
3510,3,"Currently, no framework has consolidated all of the key strategies and considerations that were found in this review to guide health care organizations when engaging patients and family members in a health IT-specific project or initiative. "
3511,3,Further research to evaluate and validate the existing strategies would be of value.
3512,4,Objective User Engagement With Mental Health Apps: Systematic Search and Panel-Based Usage Analysis
3513,0,Understanding patterns of real-world usage of mental health apps is key to maximizing their potential to increase public self-management of care. 
3514,0,"Although developer-led studies have published results on the use of mental health apps in real-world settings, no study yet has systematically examined usage patterns of a large sample of mental health apps relying on independently collected data."
3515,1,"A systematic engine search was conducted using Google Play to identify Android apps with 10,000 installs or more targeting anxiety, depression, or emotional well-being. "
3516,1,Coding of apps included primary incorporated techniques and mental health focus. 
3517,1,Behavioral data on real-world usage were obtained from a panel that provides aggregated nonpersonal information on user engagement with mobile apps.
3518,2,"In total, 93 apps met the inclusion criteria (installs: median 100,000, IQR 90,000). "
3519,2,"The median percentage of daily active users (open rate) was 4.0% (IQR 4.7%) with a difference between trackers (median 6.3%, IQR 10.2%) and peer-support apps (median 17.0%) versus breathing exercise apps (median 1.6%, IQR 1.6%; all z >= 3.42, all P<.001). "
3520,2,"Among active users, daily minutes of use were significantly higher for mindfulness/meditation (median 21.47, IQR 15.00) and peer support (median 35.08, n=2) apps than for apps incorporating other techniques (tracker, breathing exercise, psychoeducation: medians range 3.53-8.32; all z >= 2.11, all P<.05). "
3521,2,"The medians of app 15-day and 30-day retention rates were 3.9% (IQR 10.3%) and 3.3% (IQR 6.2%), respectively. "
3522,2,"On day 30, peer support (median 8.9%, n=2), mindfulness/meditation (median 4.7%, IQR 6.2%), and tracker apps (median 6.1%, IQR 20.4%) had significantly higher retention rates than breathing exercise apps (median 0.0%, IQR 0.0%; all z >= 2.18, all P <=.04). "
3523,2,"The pattern of daily use presented a descriptive peak toward the evening for apps incorporating most techniques (tracker, psychoeducation, and peer support) except mindfulness/meditation, which exhibited two peaks (morning and night)."
3524,3,"Although the number of app installs and daily active minutes of use may seem high, only a small portion of users actually used the apps for a long period of time. "
3525,3,More studies using different datasets are needed to understand this phenomenon and the ways in which users self-manage their condition in real-world settings.
3526,4,Interaction Patterns of Men Who Have Sex With Men on a Geosocial Networking Mobile App in Seven United States Metropolitan Areas: Observational Study
3527,0,The structure of the sexual networks and partnership characteristics of young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) may be contributing to their high risk of contracting HIV in the United States. 
3528,0,"Assortative mixing, which refers to the tendency of individuals to have partners from one's own group, has been proposed as a potential explanation for disparities."
3529,1,Data were collected on user behavior between November 2015 and May 2016. 
3530,1,Data pertaining to behavior on the app were collected for men who had searched for partners with at least one search parameter narrowed from defaults or used the app to send at least one private chat message and used the app at least once during the study period. 
3531,1,Newman assortativity coefficient (R) was calculated from the study data to understand assortativity patterns of men by race. 
3532,1,Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess assortativity patterns by age. 
3533,1,"Heat maps were used to visualize the relationship between searcher's and candidate's characteristics by age band, race, or age band and race."
3534,2,"From November 2015 through May 2016, there were 2,989,737 searches M all seven metropolitan areas among 122,417 searchers. "
3535,2,Assortativity by age was important for looking at the profiles of candidates with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.284 (Birmingham) to 0.523 (San Francisco). 
3536,2,Men tended to look at the profiles of candidates that matched their race in a highly assortative manner with R ranging from 0.310 (Birmingham) to 0.566 (Los Angeles). 
3537,2,"For the initiation of chats, race appeared to be slightly assortative for some groups with R ranging from 0.023 (Birmingham) to 0.305 (Los Angeles). "
3538,2,"Asian searchers were most assortative in initiating chats with Asian candidates in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. "
3539,2,"In Birmingham and Tampa, searchers from all races tended to initiate chats with Black candidates."
3540,3,"Our results indicate that the age preferences of MSM are relatively consistent across cities, that is, younger MSM are more likely to be chatted with and have their profiles viewed compared with older MSM, but the patterns of racial mixing are more variable. "
3541,3,"Although some generalizations can be made regarding Web-based behaviors across all cities, city-specific usage patterns and trends should be analyzed to create targeted and localized interventions that may make the most difference in the lives of MSM in these areas."
3542,4,Potential for Integrating Mental Health Specialist Video Consultations in Office-Based Routine Primary Care: Cross-Sectional Qualitative Study Among Family Physicians
3543,0,"Although real-time mental health specialist video consultations have been proposed as an effective care model for treating patients with mental health conditions in primary care, little is known about their integration into routine practice from the perspective of family physicians."
3544,1,"In a cross-sectional qualitative study, we conducted 4 semistructured focus groups and 3 telephonic interviews in a sample of 19 family physicians from urban and rural districts. "
3545,1,We conducted a qualitative content analysis applying the Tailored Implementation in Chronic Diseases framework in a combined bottom-up (data-driven) and top-down strategy for deriving key domains.
3546,2,"Family physicians indicated that mental health specialist video consultations are a promising and practical way to address the most pressing challenges in current practice, that is, to increase the accessibility and co-ordination of specialized care. "
3547,2,Individual health professional factors were the most frequently discussed topics. 
3548,2,"Specifically, family physicians valued the anticipated clinical outcomes for patients and the anticipated resources set for the primary care practice as major facilitators (16/19, 84%). "
3549,2,"However, family physicians raised a concern regarding a lack of facial expressions and physical interaction (19/19, 100%), especially in emergency situations. "
3550,2,"Therefore, most family physicians considered a viable emergency plan for mental health specialist video consultations that clearly delineates the responsibilities and tasks of both family physicians and mental health specialists to be essential (11/19, 58%). "
3551,2,"Social, political, and legal factors, as well as guideline factors, were hardly discussed as prerequisites for individual family physicians to integrate mental health specialist video consultations into routine care. "
3552,2,"To facilitate the implementation of future mental health specialist video consultation models, we compiled a checklist of recommendations that covers (1) buy-in from practices (eg, emphasizing logistical and psychological relief for the practice), (2) the engagement of patients (eg, establishing a trusted patient-provider relationship), (3) the setup and conduct of consultations (eg, reliable emergency plans), and (4) the fostering of collaboration between family physicians and mental health specialists (eg, kick-off meetings to build trust)."
3553,3,"By leveraging the primary care practice as a familiar environment for patients, mental health specialist video consultations provide timely specialist support and potentially lead to benefits for patients and more efficient processes of care. "
3554,3,Integration should account for the determinants of practice as described by the family physicians.
3555,4,Using Facebook Advertising to Recruit Representative Samples: Feasibility Assessment of a Cross-Sectional Survey
3556,0,Facebook has shown promise as an economical means of recruiting participants for health research. 
3557,0,"However, few studies have evaluated this recruitment method in Canada, fewer still targeting older adults, and, to our knowledge, none specifically in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL)."
3558,1,"Facebook advertising was used to recruit for a Web-based survey on cancer awareness and prevention during April and May 2018; during recruitment, additional advertisements were targeted to increase representation of demographics that we identified as being underrepresented in our sample. "
3559,1,Sociodemographic and health characteristics of the study sample were compared with distributions of the underlying population to determine representativeness. 
3560,1,"Cramer V indicates the magnitude of the difference between the sample and population distributions, interpreted as small (Cramer V=0.10), medium (0.30), and large (0.50). "
3561,1,"Sample characteristics were considered representative if there was no statistically significant difference in distributions (chi-square P>.01) or if the difference was small (V <= 0.10), and practically representative if 0.10<V <= 0.20. "
3562,1,The cost per recruit of Facebook advertising was compared with a quote for a random digit dialing (RDD)-recruited postal survey to determine if this method was economical.
3563,2,"Facebook advertising is feasible and economical to conduct survey research, reaching 34,012 people, of which 2067 clicked on the ad, for a final sample size of 1048 people at Can $2.18 per recruit versus the quoted Can $23,316.05 for 400 recruits (Can $35.52 per recruit) via RDD. "
3564,2,"The sample was representative of rural and urban geography (P=.02; V=0.073), practically representative of age (P=.003; V=0.145) and income (P<.001; V=0.188), and over-representative of women (P<.001; V=0.507) and higher levels of education (P<.001; V=0.488). "
3565,2,"The sample was representative of the proportion of people with a regular health care provider (P=.94; V=0.025), diabetes prevalence (P=.002; V=0.096), and having had a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy (P=.27; V=0.034), and it was practically representative of smoking status (P<.001; V=0.14), and body mass index (P<.001; V=0.135). "
3566,2,"The sample was not representative of arthritis prevalence (P<.001; V=0.573), perceived health (P<.001; V=0.384), or time since last seasonal flu shot (P<.001; V=0.449)."
3567,3,"Facebook advertising offers an easy, rapid, and economical means to recruit a partially representative (representative or practically representative of 8 of the 13 characteristics studied) sample of middle-aged and older adults for health survey research. "
3568,3,"As Facebook uses a nonrandom targeting algorithm, caution is warranted in its applications for certain types of research."
3569,4,Patient Commitment to Health (PACT-Health) in the Heart Failure Population: A Focus Group Study of an Active Communication Framework for Patient-Centered Health Behavior
3570,0,"Over 6 million Americans have heart failure, and 1 in 8 deaths included heart failure as a contributing cause in 2016. "
3571,0,Lifestyle changes and adherence to diet and exercise regimens are important in limiting disease progression. 
3572,0,Health coaching and public commitment are two interactive communication strategies that may improve self-management of heart failure.
3573,1,Focus groups were conducted in two locations. 
3574,1,"We studied 2 patients in Oakland, California, and 5 patients in Los Angeles, California. "
3575,1,Patients were referred by local cardiologists and had to have a diagnosis of chronic heart failure. 
3576,1,"We used a semistructured interview tool to explore several patient-centered themes including medication adherence, exercise habits, dietary habits, goals, accountability, and rewards. "
3577,1,We coded focus group data using the a priori coding criteria for these domains.
3578,2,"Medication adherence barriers included regimen complexity, forgetfulness, and difficulty coping with side effects. "
3579,2,Participants reported that they receive little instruction from care providers on appropriate exercise and dietary habits. 
3580,2,They also reported personal and social obstacles to achieving these objectives. 
3581,2,"Participants were in favor of structured goal setting, use of online social networks, and financial rewards as a means of promoting health lifestyles. "
3582,2,Peers were viewed as better motivating agents than family members.
3583,3,"An active communication framework involving dissemination of diet-and exercise-related health information, structured goal setting, peer accountability, and financial rewards appears promising in the management of heart failure."
3584,4,Mining of Textual Health Information from Reddit: Analysis of Chronic Diseases With Extracted Entities and Their Relations
3585,0,"Social media platforms constitute a rich data source for natural language processing tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, and sentiment analysis. "
3586,0,"In particular, social media platforms about health provide a different insight into patient's experiences with diseases and treatment than those found in the scientific literature."
3587,1,"We collected a corpus of 17,624 text posts from disease-specific subreddits of the social news and discussion website Reddit. "
3588,1,"For entity and relation extraction from this corpus, we employed the PKDE4J tool developed by Song et al (2015). "
3589,1,PKDE4J is a text mining system that integrates dictionary-based entity extraction and rule-based relation extraction in a highly flexible and extensible framework.
3590,2,"Using PKDE4J, we extracted 2 types of entities and relations: biomedical entities and relations and subject-predicate-object entity relations. "
3591,2,"In total, 82,138 entities and 30,341 relation pairs were extracted from the Reddit dataset. "
3592,2,The most highly mentioned entities were those related to oncological disease (2884 occurrences of cancer) and asthma (2180 occurrences). 
3593,2,"The relation pair anatomy-disease was the most frequent (5550 occurrences), the highest frequent entities in this pair being cancer and lymph. "
3594,2,"The manual validation of the extracted entities showed a very good performance of the system at the entity extraction task (3682/5151, 71.48% extracted entities were correctly labeled)."
3595,3,This study showed that people are eager to share their personal experience with chronic diseases on social media platforms despite possible privacy and security issues. 
3596,3,The results reported in this paper are promising and demonstrate the need for more in-depth studies on the way patients with chronic diseases express themselves on social media platforms.
3597,4,Outcomes and Device Usage for Fully Automated Internet Interventions Designed for a Smartphone or Personal Computer: The MobileQuit Smoking Cessation Randomized Controlled Trial
3598,0,"Many best practice smoking cessation programs use fully automated internet interventions designed for nonmobile personal computers (desktop computers, laptops, and tablets). "
3599,0,A relatively small number of smoking cessation interventions have been designed specifically for mobile devices such as smartphones.
3600,1,"Overall, 1271 smokers who wanted to quit were randomly assigned to (1) MobileQuit (designed for-and constrained its use to-mobile devices, included text messaging, and embodied tunnel information architecture) or (2) QuitOnline (designed for nonmobile desktop or tablet computers, did not include text messages, and used a flexible hybrid matrix-hierarchical information architecture). "
3601,1,Primary outcomes included self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. 
3602,1,"Program visits were unobtrusively assessed (frequency, duration, and device used for access)."
3603,2,Significantly more MobileQuit participants than QuitOnline participants reported quitting smoking. 
3604,2,"Abstinence rates using intention-to-treat analysis were 20.7% (131/633) vs 11.4% (73/638) at 3 months, 24.6% (156/633) vs 19.3% (123/638) at 6 months, and 15.8% (100/633) vs 8.8% (56/638) for both 3 and 6 months. "
3605,2,"Using Complete Cases, MobileQuit's advantage was significant at 3 months (45.6% [131/287] vs 28.4% [73/257]) and the combined 3 and 6 months (40.5% [100/247] vs 25.9% [56/216]) but not at 6 months (43.5% [156/359] vs 34.4% [123/329]). "
3606,2,Participants in both conditions reported their program was usable and helpful. 
3607,2,MobileQuit participants visited their program 5 times more frequently than did QuitOnline participants. 
3608,2,"Consistent with the MobileQuit's built-in constraint, 89.46% (8820/9859) of its visits were made on an intended mobile device, whereas 47.72% (691/1448) of visits to QuitOnline used an intended nonmobile device. "
3609,2,"Among MobileQuit participants, 76.0% (459/604) used only an intended mobile device, 23.0% (139/604) used both mobile and nonmobile devices, and 0.1% (6/604) used only a nonmobile device. "
3610,2,"Among QuitOnline participants, 31.3% (137/438) used only the intended nonmobile devices, 16.7% (73/438) used both mobile and nonmobile devices, and 52.1% (228/438) used only mobile devices (primarily smartphones)."
3611,3,"This study provides evidence for optimizing intervention design for smartphones over a usual care internet approach in which interventions are designed primarily for use on nonmobile devices such as desktop computers, laptops. "
3612,3,or tablets. 
3613,3,We propose that future internet interventions should be designed for use on all of the devices (multiple screens) that users prefer. 
3614,3,"We forecast that the approach of designing internet interventions for mobile vs nonmobile devices will be replaced by internet interventions that use a single Web app designed to be responsive (adapt to different screen sizes and operating systems), share user data across devices, embody a pervasive information architecture, and complemented by text message notifications."
3615,4,"Tobacco Use Behaviors, Attitudes, and Demographic Characteristics of Tobacco Opinion Leaders and Their Followers: Twitter Analysis"
3616,0,"Tobacco-related content on social media is generated and propagated by opinion leaders on the Web who disseminate messages to others in their network, including followers, who then continue to spread the information. "
3617,0,"Opinion leaders can exert powerful influences on their followers' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; yet, little is known about the demographic characteristics and tobacco use behavior of tobacco opinion leaders on the Web and their followers, compared with general Twitter users."
3618,1,We constructed the social networks of people who tweet about tobacco and categorized them using a combination of social network and Twitter metrics. 
3619,1,"To understand the characteristics of tobacco opinion leaders and their followers, we conducted a survey of tobacco opinion leaders, their followers, and general Twitter users. "
3620,1,"The sample included 347 opinion leaders, 567 followers, and 519 general users. "
3621,1,"The opinion leaders had a median of 1000 followers, whereas followers and general users had fewer than 600 followers."
3622,2,"Opinion leaders were more likely than their followers to report past month use of tobacco products; followers, in turn, were more likely to report past month use of these products than general Twitter users. "
3623,2,The followers appeared to be an especially vulnerable group; they tended to be younger (mean age 22.4 years) and have lower education compared with the opinion leaders and general users.
3624,3,Followers of Twitter tobacco opinion leaders are a vulnerable group that might benefit from antitobacco education to counter the protobacco communications they see on social media.
3625,4,Perceived Patient-Provider Communication Quality and Sociodemographic Factors Associated With Watching Health-Related Videos on YouTube: A Cross-Sectional Analysis
3626,0,"Approximately 73% of US adults use YouTube, making it the most popular social media platform. "
3627,0,Misinformation on social media is a growing concern; recent studies show a high proportion of misinformative health-related videos. 
3628,0,Several studies on patient-provider communication and general health information seeking have been conducted. 
3629,0,"However, few studies to date have examined the potential association between patient-provider communication and health information seeking on specific social media platforms such as YouTube. "
3630,0,A better understanding of this relationship may inform future health communication interventions.
3631,1,Data from the 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey were analyzed (N=3504). 
3632,1,The primary outcome was whether participants watched a health-related video on YouTube over the past 12 months. 
3633,1,"A patient-provider communication composite score was created by summing responses about how often providers did the following: (1) gave you the chance to ask all the health-related questions you had, (2) gave attention to your feelings, (3) involved you in health care decisions as much as you wanted, (4) made sure that you understood the things you needed to do to take care of your health, (5) explained things in a way that you could understand, (6) spent enough time with you, and (7) helped you deal with feelings of uncertainty. "
3634,1,"Sociodemographic factors included age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education. "
3635,1,Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were conducted.
3636,2,Approximately 1067 (35% weighted prevalence) participants reported watching a health-related video on YouTube. 
3637,2,Higher perceived quality of patient-provider communication on the composite score was significantly associated with lower odds of watching health-related videos on YouTube. 
3638,2,"Regarding sociodemographic factors, increasing age and being a high school graduate (compared with college graduate) were associated with lower odds of watching health-related videos on YouTube; whereas, Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asians were more likely to have watched a health-related video on YouTube. "
3639,2,"For individual aspects of patient-physician communication, two of seven patient-provider communication variables were significant. "
3640,2,"Those who reported that providers ""sometimes"" spent enough time with them had higher odds of watching a health-related video on YouTube, compared with those who said providers ""always"" spent enough time with them. "
3641,2,"Participants reporting that they ""never"" have a chance to ask all their health-related questions also had higher odds of watching health-related videos on YouTube compared with those who reported ""always."""
3642,3,Higher perceived quality of patient-provider communication is associated with lower odds of watching health-related videos on YouTube. 
3643,3,"When providers do not spend enough time or give an opportunity to ask questions, patients are more likely to pursue health information on social media."
3644,4,Effects of Mock Facebook Workday Comments on Public Perception of Professional Credibility: A Field Study in Canada
3645,0,"There is considerable discussion of risks to health professionals' reputations and employment from personal social media use, though its impacts on professional credibility and the health professional-client relationship are unknown."
3646,1,"In a controlled field study, participants reviewed randomly assigned mock Facebook profiles. "
3647,1,"The 2x2x2 factorial design of mock profiles included gender (female/male), health profession (physician/veterinarian), and workday comment type (evident frustration/ambiguous). "
3648,1,Participants then rated the profile owner's credibility on a visual analog scale. 
3649,1,An analysis of variance test compared ratings. 
3650,1,Mediation analyses tested the importance of credibility ratings on participants' willingness to become a client of the mock health professional.
3651,2,Participants (N=357) rated health professionals whose personal Facebook profile showed a comment with evident frustration rather than an ambiguous workday comment as less credible (P<.001; mean difference 11.18 [SE 1.28]; 95% CI 8.66 to 13.70). 
3652,2,"Furthermore, participants indicated they were less likely to become clients of the former when they considered credibility (standardized beta=.69; P<.001). "
3653,2,Credibility explained 86% of the variation in the relationship between the type of workday comment and the participant's willingness to become a client of the health professional.
3654,3,This study provides the first evidence of the impact of health professionals' personal online disclosures on credibility and the health relationship. 
3655,3,Public perceptions about professionalism and credibility are integral to developing the evidence base for e-professionalism guidelines and encouraging best practices in social media use.
3656,4,Mood Prediction of Patients With Mood Disorders by Machine Learning Using Passive Digital Phenotypes Based on the Circadian Rhythm: Prospective Observational Cohort Study
3657,0,"Virtually, all organisms on Earth have their own circadian rhythm, and humans are no exception. "
3658,0,"Circadian rhythms are associated with various human states, especially mood disorders, and disturbance of the circadian rhythm is known to be very closely related. "
3659,0,Attempts have also been made to derive clinical implications associated with mood disorders using the vast amounts of digital log that is acquired by digital technologies develop and using computational analysis techniques.
3660,1,We performed a prospective observational cohort study on 55 patients with mood disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD] and bipolar disorder type 1 [BD I] and 2 [BD II]) for 2 years. 
3661,1,A smartphone app for self-recording daily mood scores and detecting light exposure (using the installed sensor) were provided. 
3662,1,"From daily worn activity trackers, digital log data of activity, sleep, and heart rate were collected. "
3663,1,"Passive digital phenotypes were processed into 130 features based on circadian rhythms, and a mood prediction algorithm was developed by random forest."
3664,2,"The mood state prediction accuracies for the next 3 days in all patients, MDD patients, BD I patients, and BD II patients were 65%, 65%, 64%, and 65% with 0.7, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.67 area under the curve (AUC) values, respectively. "
3665,2,"The accuracies of all patients for no episode (NE), depressive episode (DE), manic episode (ME), and hypomanic episode (HME) were 85.3%, 87%, 94%, and 91.2% with 0.87, 0.87, 0.958, and 0.912 AUC values, respectively. "
3666,2,"The prediction accuracy in BD II patients was distinctively balanced as high showing 82.6%, 74.4%, and 87.5% of accuracy (with generally good sensitivity and specificity) with 0.919, 0.868, and 0.949 AUC values for NE, DE, and HME, respectively."
3667,3,"On the basis of the theoretical basis of chronobiology, this study proposed a good model for future research by developing a mood prediction algorithm using machine learning by processing and reclassifying digital log data. "
3668,3,"In addition to academic value, it is expected that this study will be of practical help to improve the prognosis of patients with mood disorders by making it possible to apply actual clinical application owing to the rapid expansion of digital technology."
3669,4,Privacy-Preserving Record Grouping and Consent Management Based on a Public-Private Key Signature Scheme: Theoretical Analysis and Feasibility Study
3670,0,Clinical and social trials create evidence that enables medical progress. 
3671,0,"However, the gathering of personal and patient data requires high security and privacy standards. "
3672,0,Direct linking of personal information and medical data is commonly hidden through pseudonymization. 
3673,0,"While this makes unauthorized access to personal medical data more difficult, a centralized pseudonymization list can still pose a security risk. "
3674,0,"In addition, medical data linked via pseudonyms can still be used for data-driven reidentification."
3675,1,"Based on public-private key cryptography, we set up a signing mechanism for patient data records and detailed the workflows for (1) user registration, (2) user log-in, (3) record storing, and (4) record grouping. "
3676,1,"We evaluated the proposed mechanism for performance, examined the potential risks based on cryptographic collision, and carried out a threat analysis."
3677,2,"The performance analysis showed that all workflows could be performed with an average runtime of 0.057 to 42.320 ms (user registration), 0.083 to 0.606 ms (record creation), and 0.005 to 0.198 ms (record grouping) depending on the chosen cryptographic tools. "
3678,2,"We expected no realistic risk of cryptographic collision in the proposed system, and the threat analysis revealed that 3 distinct server systems of the proposed setup had to be compromised to allow access to combined medical data and private data. "
3679,2,"However, this would still allow only for data-driven deidentification. "
3680,2,"For a full reidentification, all 3 trial servers and all study participants would have to be compromised. "
3681,2,"In addition, the approach supports consent management, automatically anonymizes the data after trial closure, and provides basic mechanisms against data forging."
3682,3,The proposed approach has a high security and privacy level in comparison with traditional centralized pseudonymization approaches and does not require a trusted third party. 
3683,3,"The only drawback in comparison with central pseudonymization is the directed feedback of accidental findings to individual participants, as this is not possible with a quasi-anonymous storage of patient data."
3684,4,Serious Gaming and Gamification Education in Health Professions: Systematic Review
3685,0,"There is a worldwide shortage of health workers, and this issue requires innovative education solutions. "
3686,0,"Serious gaming and gamification education have the potential to provide a quality, cost-effective, novel approach that is flexible, portable, and enjoyable and allow interaction with tutors and peers."
3687,1,"A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Educational Resources Information Centre, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was conducted from 1990 to August 2017. "
3688,1,Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs were eligible for inclusion. 
3689,1,"Two reviewers independently searched, screened, and assessed the study quality and extracted data. "
3690,1,"A meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. "
3691,1,"Therefore, a narrative synthesis is presented."
3692,2,A total of 27 RCTs and 3 cluster RCTs with 3634 participants were included. 
3693,2,"Two studies evaluated gamification interventions, and the remaining evaluated serious gaming interventions. "
3694,2,One study reported a small statistically significant difference between serious gaming and digital education of primary care physicians in the time to control blood pressure in a subgroup of their patients already taking antihypertensive medications. 
3695,2,There was evidence of a moderate-to-large magnitude of effect from five studies evaluating individually delivered interventions for objectively measured knowledge compared with traditional learning. 
3696,2,There was also evidence of a small-to-large magnitude of effect from 10 studies for improved skills compared with traditional learning. 
3697,2,"Two and four studies suggested equivalence between interventions and controls for knowledge and skills, respectively. "
3698,2,Evidence suggested that serious gaming was at least as effective as other digital education modalities for these outcomes. 
3699,2,There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether one type of serious gaming/gamification intervention is more effective than any other. 
3700,2,There was limited evidence for the effects of serious gaming/gamification on professional attitudes. 
3701,2,"Serious gaming/gamification may improve satisfaction, but the evidence was limited. "
3702,2,Evidence was of low or very low quality for all outcomes. 
3703,2,"Quality of evidence was downgraded due to the imprecision, inconsistency, and limitations of the study."
3704,3,"Serious gaming/gamification appears to be at least as effective as controls, and in many studies, more effective for improving knowledge, skills, and satisfaction. "
3705,3,"However, the available evidence is mostly of low quality and calls for further rigorous, theory-driven research."
3706,4,Characterizing the Digital Health Citizen: Mixed-Methods Study Deriving a New Typology
3707,0,A key challenge for health systems harnessing digital tools and services is that of digital inclusion. 
3708,0,"Typically, digital inequalities are conceptualized in relation to unequal access or usage. "
3709,0,"However, these differences do not fully explain differences in health behavior as a result of health-related internet use."
3710,1,"We used a mixed-methods design using (1) qualitative data from 43 semistructured interviews about individuals' general and health-related internet use, and how this influenced their health perception and their help-seeking decisions, and (2) quantitative data from the Oxford Internet Surveys (OxIS), a household survey of 2150 adults in England about their internet use and other characteristics. "
3711,1,We used the interview data to identify constructs that described motivations and enablers affecting how internet use shaped respondents' health perception and health service use. 
3712,1,"We then used these constructs to identify variables in OxIS, which provided a quantitative measure of these constructs. "
3713,1,"We then undertook a hierarchical cluster analysis of these constructs, using the numerical variables, to derive a proposed typology of health information seekers."
3714,2,"Both the qualitative findings and the subsequent cluster analysis suggested the existence of 6 types of individuals, categorized as learners, pragmatists, skeptics, worriers, delegators, and adigitals. "
3715,2,Learners had a strong desire to understand health better. 
3716,2,They used the internet to make decisions about whether they needed to see a professional and to learn about their and others' health. 
3717,2,Pragmatists primarily used the internet to decide whether seeing a doctor was worthwhile. 
3718,2,Skeptics were skeptical of physicians and the medical system and valued the internet for solving health problems that doctors may not be able to deal with. 
3719,2,"Worriers found it difficult to interpret health information online, described health information seeking online as frightening, and reported a critical attitude toward online health information despite seeking it frequently. "
3720,2,"Delegators comprised nonusers and users valuing the internet as an information source, but not necessarily wanting or being able to use the internet themselves. "
3721,2,"Adigitals comprised many nonusers, but also users, who did not see the internet as a useful information tool and presented strong views on its low suitability for health care."
3722,3,"This research supports a shift in the understanding of the digital divide in health, away from only access and usage issues, toward also conceptualizing an outcomes divide, whereby different types of health behavior result from the differing orientations of internet users accessing online health information. "
3723,3,This new typology can be used to inform digital inclusion policies in health systems.
3724,4,Mobile Phone-Based Unobtrusive Ecological Momentary Assessment of Day-to-Day Mood: An Explorative Study
3725,0,"Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of people's current experiences in real time in their natural environments, which offers a granular perspective on patients' experience of pain and other symptoms. "
3726,0,"However, EMA can be burdensome to patients, and its benefits depend upon patients' engagement in the assessments."
3727,1,This individual patient data meta-analysis was based on 12 EMA datasets that examined patients with chronic noncancer-related pain (n=701). 
3728,1,The EMA-completion rates were calculated on a daily basis for each patient. 
3729,1,"Multilevel models were used to test the following predictors of completion rates at different levels: within-patient factors (days into the study and daily pain level), between-patient factors (age, sex, pain diagnosis, and average pain level per person), and between-study EMA design factors (study duration, sampling density, and survey length)."
3730,0,"Preventing drug interactions is an important goal to maximize patient benefit from medications Summarizing potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) for clinical decision support is challenging, and there is no single repository for PDDI evidence. "
3731,0,"Additionally, inconsistencies across compendia and other sources have been well documented Standard search strategies for complete and current evidence about PDDIs have not heretofore been developed or validated."
3732,1,"We invited a convenience sample of 70 drug information experts, including compendia editors, knowledge-base vendors, and clinicians, via emails to complete a survey on identifying PDDI evidence. "
3733,1,"We created a Web-based survey that included questions regarding the (1) development and conduct of searches; (2) resources used, for example, databases, compendia, search engines, etc; (3) types of keywords used to search for the specific PDDI information; (4) study types included and excluded in searches; and (5) search terms used. "
3734,1,Search strategy questions focused on 6 topics of the PDDI information-(1) that a PDDI exists; (2) seriousness; (3) clinical consequences; (4) management options; (5) mechanism; and (6) health outcomes.
3735,2,"Twenty participants (response rate, 20/70, 29%) completed the survey. "
3736,2,"The majority (17/20, 85%) were drug information specialists, drug interaction researchers, compendia editors, or clinical pharmacists, with 60% (12/20) having >10 years' experience. "
3737,2,"Over half (11/20, 55%) worked for clinical solutions vendors or knowledge-base vendors. "
3738,2,"Most participants developed (18/20, 90%) and conducted (19/20, 95%) search strategies without librarian assistance. "
3739,2,"PubMed (20/20, 100%) and Google Scholar (11/20, 55%) were most commonly searched for papers, followed by Google Web Search (7/20, 35%) and EMBASE (3/20, 15%). "
3740,2,No respondents reported using Scopus. 
3741,2,"A variety of subscription and open-access databases were used, most commonly Lexicomp (9/20, 45%), Micromedex (8/20, 40%), Drugs@FDA (17/20, 85%), and DailyMed (13/20, 65%). "
3742,2,"Facts and Comparisons was the most commonly used compendia (8/20, 40%). "
3743,2,"Across the 6 attributes of interest, generic drug name was the most common keyword used. "
3744,2,"Respondents reported using more types of keywords when searching to identify the existence of PDDIs and determine their mechanism than when searching for the other 4 attributes (seriousness, consequences, management, and health outcomes). "
3745,2,"Regarding the types of evidence useful for evaluating a PDDI, clinical trials, case reports, and systematic reviews were considered relevant, while animal and in vitro data studies were not."
3746,3,This study suggests that drug interaction experts use various keyword strategies and various database and Web resources depending on the PDDI evidence they are seeking. 
3747,3,Greater automation and standardization across search strategies could improve one's ability to identify PDDI evidence. 
3748,3,"Hence, future research focused on enhancing the existing search tools and designing recommended standards is needed."
3749,4,A Wolf in Sheeps Clothing: Reuse of Routinely Obtained Laboratory Data in Research
3750,0,Electronic health records (EHRs) bring many opportunities for information utilization. 
3751,0,One such use is the surveillance conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
3752,0,This process currently comprises manual collection and review of EHRs of 4-and 8-year old children in 11 US states for the presence of ASD criteria. 
3753,0,The work is time-consuming and expensive.
3754,1,We developed a natural language processing (NLP) parser to extract expressions of 12 DSM criteria using 104 patterns and 92 lexicons (1787 terms). 
3755,1,The parser is rule-based to enable precise extraction of the entities from the text. 
3756,1,"The entities themselves are encompassed in the EHRs as very diverse expressions of the diagnostic criteria written by different people at different times (clinicians, speech pathologists, among others). "
3757,1,"Due to the sparsity of the data, a rule-based approach is best suited until larger datasets can be generated for machine learning algorithms."
3758,2,We evaluated our rule-based parser and compared it with a machine learning baseline (decision tree). 
3759,2,"Using a test set of 6636 sentences (50 EHRs), we found that our parser achieved 76% precision, 43% recall (ie, sensitivity), and >99% specificity for criterion extraction. "
3760,2,The performance was better for the rule-based approach than for the machine learning baseline (60% precision and 30% recall). 
3761,2,"For some individual criteria, precision was as high as 97% and recall 57%. "
3762,2,"Since precision was very high, we were assured that criteria were rarely assigned incorrectly, and our numbers presented a lower bound of their presence in EHRs. "
3763,2,We then conducted a case study and parsed 4480 new EHRs covering 10 years of surveillance records from the Arizona Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program. 
3764,2,The social criteria (A1 criteria) showed the biggest change over the years. 
3765,2,The communication criteria (A2 criteria) did not distinguish the ASD from the non-ASD records. 
3766,2,"Among behaviors and interests criteria (A3 criteria), 1 (A3b) was present with much greater frequency in the ASD than in the non-ASD EHRs."
3767,3,Our results demonstrate that NLP can support large-scale analysis useful for ASD surveillance and research. 
3768,3,"In the future, we intend to facilitate detailed analysis and integration of national datasets."
3769,4,"Web-Based Self-Management Programs for Bipolar Disorder: Insights From the Online, Recovery-Oriented Bipolar Individualised Tool Project"
3770,0,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex, relapsing mood disorder characterized by considerable morbidity and mortality. "
3771,0,Web-based self-management interventions provide marked opportunities for several chronic mental health conditions. 
3772,0,"However, Web-based self-management programs targeting BD are underrepresented compared with programs targeting other psychiatric conditions."
3773,1,"We have discussed the opportunities and challenges in developing an engaging, evidence-based, safe intervention within the context of the following three nested domains: (1) intervention development; (2) scientific testing of the intervention; and (3) ethical framework including risk management."
3774,2,"We gained the following insights across the three abovementioned overlapping domains: Web-based interventions can be optimized through (1) codesign with consumers with lived experience to ensure relevance and appropriateness to the target audience; (2) novel content development processes that iteratively combine evidence-based information with lived experience perspectives, capitalizing on multimedia (eg, videos) that the digital health space provides; and (3) incorporating Web-based communities to connect end users and promote constructive engagement by access to a Web-based coach."
3775,3,"Self-management is effective in BD, even for those on the more severe end of the spectrum. "
3776,3,"While there are challenges to be aware of, guided self-management programs, such as those offered by the ORBIT project, which are specifically developed for Web-based delivery provide highly accessible, engaging, and potentially provocative treatments for chronically ill populations who may otherwise have never engaged with treatment. "
3777,3,"Key questions about engagement, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness will be answered by the ORBIT project over the next 18 months."
3778,4,A Mobile Game for Patients With Breast Cancer for Chemotherapy Self-Management and Quality-of-Life Improvement: Randomized Controlled Trial
3779,0,The application of game-based learning in clinical practice has shown potential advantages in previous studies. 
3780,0,"However, there have been little efforts to use smartphone-based mobile games in the management of adult patients with cancer."
3781,1,A total of 76 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were planned to receive cytotoxic chemotherapy were enrolled in this trial. 
3782,1,"Study participants were randomly assigned to a mobile game play group (game group, n=36) or a conventional education group (control group, n=40) in a ratio of 1:1. "
3783,1,The patients were unblinded and followed prospectively for 3 weeks. 
3784,1,"Outcome measures included time spent for education, compliance to medication, physical side effects, and psychological side effects including quality of life (QoL)."
3785,2,"Overall, 72 out of 76 patients completed the study after 3 weeks (95%). "
3786,2,The subjects in the game group showed high levels of satisfaction with the app. 
3787,2,"The time spent playing the mobile game in the game group was longer than that spent for self-education in the control group (mean 22.2, SD 6.1 vs mean 5.5, SD 4.0 minutes a day; P<.001). "
3788,2,"The mobile game group showed better drug adherence (Korean version of the Medication Adherence Rating Scale; mean 7.6, SD 0.7 vs mean 6.5, SD 0.5; P<.001). "
3789,2,"The use of the mobile game was associated with lower rates of chemotherapy-related side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, numbness of hand or foot, and hair loss, than the control group. "
3790,2,"The game group exhibited better QoL during chemotherapy (mean 74.9, SD 3.5 vs mean 72.2, SD 5.3; P=.01). "
3791,2,"However, there were no significant differences in terms of depression and anxiety scales."
3792,3,This study suggests the feasibility and potentiality of the use of smartphone mobile games for patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. 
3793,3,"Education using a mobile game led to better patient education, improved drug compliance, decreased side effects, and better QoL compared with conventional education. "
3794,3,"Mobile games can be used as easy, fun, and effective measures for patient education and have the potential to improve treatment outcomes."
3795,4,Telerehabilitation for Stroke Survivors: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
3796,0,Telerehabilitation is an emerging technology through which medical rehabilitation care can be provided from a distance.
3797,1,"Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by searching MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science databases. "
3798,1,Continuous data were extracted for relevant outcomes and analyzed using the RevMan software as the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI in a fixed-effect meta-analysis model.
3799,2,"We included 15 studies (1339 patients) in our systematic review, while only 12 were included in the pooled analysis. "
3800,2,"The combined effect estimate showed no significant differences between the telerehabilitation and control groups in terms of the Barthel Index (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.08), Berg Balance Scale (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.26), Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (SMD 0.50, 95% CI -0.09 to 1.09), and Stroke Impact Scale (mobility subscale; SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.48]) scores. "
3801,2,"Moreover, the majority of included studies showed that both groups were comparable in terms of health-related quality of life (of stroke survivors), Caregiver Strain Index, and patients' satisfaction with care. "
3802,2,One study showed that the cost of telerehabilitation was lower than usual care by US $867.
3803,3,"Telerehabilitation can be a suitable alternative to usual rehabilitation care in poststroke patients, especially in remote or underserved areas. "
3804,3,Larger studies are needed to evaluate the health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness with the ongoing improvements in telerehabilitation networks.
3805,4,Differences in the Effect of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Improving Nonclinical Depressive Symptoms Among Workers by Time Preference: Randomized Controlled Trial
3806,0,Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown a significant intervention effect of internet-based computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) on improving nonclinical depressive symptoms among healthy workers and community residents in a primary prevention setting. 
3807,0,"Time preference is one's relative valuation for having a reward (eg, money) at present than at a later date. "
3808,0,Time preference may affect the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy.
3809,1,"All workers in one corporate group (approximate n= 20,000) were recruited. "
3810,1,Participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to either intervention or control groups. 
3811,1,Participants in the intervention group completed 6 weekly lessons and homework assignments within the iCBT program. 
3812,1,"The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Kessler's Psychological Distress Scale (K6) measures were obtained at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. "
3813,1,Two subgroups were defined by the median of time preference score at baseline.
3814,2,"Only few (835/20,000, 4.2%) workers completed the baseline survey. "
3815,2,"Of the 835 participants, 706 who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. "
3816,2,"Participants who selected irrational time preference options were excluded (21 and 18 participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively). "
3817,2,"A three-way interaction (group [intervention/control] x time [baseline/follow-up] x time preference [higher/lower]) effect of iCBT was significant for BDI-II (t(1147.42) = 2.33, P=.02) and K6 (t(1254.04) = 2.51, P=.01) at the 3-month follow-up, with a greater effect of the iCBT in the group with higher time preference. "
3818,2,No significant three-way interaction was found at the 6-and 12-month follow-ups.
3819,3,"The effects of the iCBT were greater for the group with higher time preference at the shorter follow-up, but it was leveled off later. "
3820,3,"Workers with higher time preference may change their cognition or behavior more quickly, but these changes may not persist."
3821,4,Forecasting the Maturation of Electronic Health Record Functions Among US Hospitals: Retrospective Analysis and Predictive Model
3822,0,The Meaningful Use (MU) program has promoted electronic health record adoption among US hospitals. 
3823,0,"Studies have shown that electronic health record adoption has been slower than desired in certain types of hospitals; but generally, the overall adoption rate has increased among hospitals. "
3824,0,"However, these studies have neither evaluated the adoption of advanced functionalities of electronic health records (beyond MU) nor forecasted electronic health record maturation over an extended period in a holistic fashion. "
3825,0,Additional research is needed to prospectively assess US hospitals' electronic health record technology adoption and advancement patterns.
3826,1,The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics' Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (EMRAM) dataset was used to track historic uptakes of various electronic health record functionalities considered critical to improving health care quality and efficiency in hospitals. 
3827,1,The Bass model was used to predict the technological diffusion rates for repeated electronic health record adoptions where upgrades undergo rapid technological improvements. 
3828,1,The forecast used EMRAM data from 2006 to 2014 to estimate adoption levels to the year 2035.
3829,2,"In 2014, over 5400 hospitals completed HIMSS' annual EMRAM survey (86%+ of total US hospitals). "
3830,2,"In 2006, the majority of the US hospitals were in EMRAM Stages 0, 1, and 2. "
3831,2,"By 2014, most hospitals had achieved Stages 3, 4, and 5. "
3832,2,"The overall technology diffusion model (ie, the Bass model) reached an adjusted R-squared of .91. "
3833,2,The final forecast depicted differing trends for each of the EMRAM stages. 
3834,2,"In 2006, the first year of observation, peaks of Stages 0 and 1 were shown as electronic health record adoption predates HIMSS' EMRAM. "
3835,2,"By 2007, Stage 2 reached its peak. "
3836,2,"Stage 3 reached its full height by 2011, while Stage 4 peaked by 2014. "
3837,2,"The first three stages created a graph that exhibits the expected ""S-curve"" for technology diffusion, with inflection point being the peak diffusion rate. "
3838,2,This forecast indicates that Stage 5 should peak by 2019 and Stage 6 by 2026. 
3839,2,"Although this forecast extends to the year 2035, no peak was readily observed for Stage 7. "
3840,2,"Overall, most hospitals will achieve Stages 5, 6, or 7 of EMRAM by 2020; however, a considerable number of hospitals will not achieve Stage 7 by 2035."
3841,3,We forecasted the adoption of electronic health record capabilities from a paper-based environment (Stage 0) to an environment where only electronic information is used to document and direct care delivery (Stage 7). 
3842,3,"According to our forecasts, the majority of hospitals will not reach Stage 7 until 2035, absent major policy changes or leaps in technological capabilities. "
3843,3,These results indicate that US hospitals are decades away from fully implementing sophisticated decision support applications and interoperability functionalities in electronic health records as defined by EMRAM's Stage 7.
3844,4,Health Care Robotics: Qualitative Exploration of Key Challenges and Future Directions
3845,0,The emergence of robotics is transforming industries around the world. 
3846,0,"Robot technologies are evolving exponentially, particularly as they converge with other functionalities such as artificial intelligence to learn from their environment, from each other, and from humans."
3847,1,We conducted qualitative semistructured one-to-one interviews exploring the role of robotic applications in health care contexts. 
3848,1,"Using purposive sampling, we identified a diverse range of stakeholders involved in conceiving, procuring, developing, and using robotics in a range of national and international health care settings. "
3849,1,"Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically, supported by NVivo 10 (QSR International) software. "
3850,1,"Theoretically, this work was informed by the sociotechnical perspective, where social and technical systems are understood as being interdependent."
3851,2,"We conducted 21 interviews and these accounts suggested that there are significant opportunities for improving the safety, quality, and efficiency of health care through robotics, but our analysis identified 4 major barriers that need to be effectively negotiated to realize these: (1) no clear pull from professionals and patients, (2) appearance of robots and associated expectations and concerns, (3) disruption of the way work is organized and distributed, and (4) new ethical and legal challenges requiring flexible liability and ethical frameworks."
3852,3,"Sociotechnical challenges associated with the effective integration of robotic applications in health care settings are likely to be significant, particularly for patient-facing functions. "
3853,3,These need to be identified and addressed for effective innovation and adoption.
3854,4,Electronic Health Literacy Across the Lifespan: Measurement Invariance Study
3855,0,Electronic health (eHealth) information is ingrained in the healthcare experience to engage patients across the lifespan. 
3856,0,"Both eHealth accessibility and optimization are influenced by lifespan development, as older adults experience greater challenges accessing and using eHealth tools as compared to their younger counterparts. "
3857,0,"The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) is the most popular measure used to assess patient confidence locating, understanding, evaluating, and acting upon online health information. "
3858,0,"Currently, however, the factor structure of the eHEALS across discrete age groups is not well understood, which limits its usefulness as a measure of eHealth literacy across the lifespan."
3859,1,"Millennials (N=281, mean 26.64 years, SD 5.14), Generation X (N=164, mean 42.97 years, SD 5.01), and Baby Boomers/Silent Generation (N=384, mean 62.80 years, SD 6.66) members completed the eHEALS. "
3860,1,"The 3-factor (root mean square error of approximation, RMSEA=.06, comparative fit index, CFI=.99, Tucker-Lewis index, TLI=.98) and 4-factor (RMSEA=.06, CFI=.99, TLI=.98) models showed the best global fit, as compared to the 1-and 2-factor models. "
3861,1,"However, the 4-factor model did not have statistically significant factor loadings on the 4th factor, which led to the acceptance of the 3-factor eHEALS model. "
3862,1,"The 3-factor model included eHealth Information Awareness, Search, and Engagement. "
3863,1,"Pattern invariance for this 3-factor structure was supported with acceptable model fit (RMSEA=.07, Delta chi(2)=P>.05, Delta CFI=0). "
3864,1,"Compared to Millennials and members of Generation X, those in the Baby Boomer and Silent Generations reported less confidence in their awareness of eHealth resources (P<.001), information seeking skills (P=.003), and ability to evaluate and act on health information found on the Internet (P<.001)."
3865,2,"Young (18-48-year olds, N=411) and old (49-84-year olds, N=419) adults completed the survey. "
3866,2,A 3-factor model had the best fit (RMSEA=. 
3867,2,"06, CFI=.99, TLI=.98), as compared to the 1-factor, 2-factor, and 4-factor models. "
3868,2,"These 3-factors included eHealth Information Awareness (2 items), Information Seeking (2 items), and Information and Evaluation (4 items). "
3869,2,Pattern invariance was supported with the acceptable model fit (RMSEA=. 
3870,2,"06, Delta chi(2)=P>.05, Delta CFI=0). "
3871,2,"Compared with younger adults, older adults had less confidence in eHealth resource awareness (P<.001), information seeking skills (P<.01), and ability to evaluate and act upon online health information (P<.001)."
3872,3,"The eHEALS can be used to assess, monitor uniquely, and evaluate Internet users' awareness of eHealth resources, information seeking skills, and engagement abilities. "
3873,3,Configural and pattern invariance was observed across all generation groups in the 3-factor eHEALS model. 
3874,3,"To meet gold the standards for factor interpretation (ie, 3 items or indicators per factor), future research is needed to create and assess additional eHEALS items. "
3875,3,"Future research is also necessary to identify and test items for a fourth factor, one that captures the social nature of eHealth."
3876,4,Sharing and Empathy in Digital Spaces: Qualitative Study of Online Health Forums for Breast Cancer and Motor Neuron Disease (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)
3877,0,"The availability of an increasing number of online health forums has altered the experience of living with a health condition, as more people are now able to connect and support one another. "
3878,0,"Empathy is an important component of peer-to-peer support, although little is known about how empathy develops and operates within online health forums."
3879,1,This qualitative study analyzed data from two sources: interviews with forum users and downloaded forum posts. 
3880,1,Data were collected from two online health forums provided by UK charities: Breast Cancer Care and the Motor Neurone Disease Association. 
3881,1,We analyzed 84 threads from the breast cancer forum and 52 from the MND forum. 
3882,1,"Threads were purposively sampled to reflect varied experiences (eg, illness stages, topics of conversation, and user characteristics). "
3883,1,Semistractured interviews were conducted with 14 Breast Cancer Care forum users and five users of the MND forum. 
3884,1,All datasets were analyzed thematically using Braun and Clarke's six-phase approach and combined to triangulate the analysis.
3885,2,We found that empathy develops and operates through shared experiences and connections. 
3886,2,"The development of empathy begins outside the forum with experiences of illness onset and diagnosis, creating emotional and informational needs. "
3887,2,"Users came to the forum and found their experiences and needs were shared and understood by others, setting the empathetic tone and supportive ethos of the forum. "
3888,2,"The forum was viewed as both a useful and meaningful space in which they could share experiences, information, and emotions, and receive empathetic support within a supportive and warm atmosphere. "
3889,2,"Empathy operated through connections formed within this humane space based on similarity, relationships, and shared feelings. "
3890,2,"Users felt a need to connect to users who they felt were like themselves (eg, people sharing the same specific diagnosis). "
3891,2,They formed relationships with other users. 
3892,2,They connected based on the emotional understanding of ill health. 
3893,2,"Within these connections, empathic communication flourished."
3894,3,"Empathy develops and operates within shared experiences and connections, enabled by structural possibilities provided by the forums giving users the opportunity and means to interact within public, restricted, and more private spaces, as well as within groups and in one-to-one exchanges. "
3895,3,"The atmosphere and feeling of both sites and perceived audiences were important facilitators of empathy, with users sharing a perception of virtual communities of caring and supportive people. "
3896,3,Our findings are of value to organizations hosting health forums and to health professionals signposting patients to additional sources of support.
3897,4,Experiences of a Motivational Interview Delivered by a Robot: Qualitative Study
3898,0,Motivational interviewing is an effective intervention for supporting behavior change but traditionally depends on face-to-face dialogue with a human counselor. 
3899,0,"This study addressed a key challenge for the goal of developing social robotic motivational interviewers: creating an interview protocol, within the constraints of current artificial intelligence, which participants will find engaging and helpful."
3900,1,"NAO robots are humanoid, child-sized social robots. "
3901,1,We programmed a NAO robot with Choregraphe software to deliver a scripted motivational interview focused on increasing physical activity. 
3902,1,The interview was designed to be comprehensible even without an empathetic response from the robot. 
3903,1,Robot breathing and face-tracking functions were used to give an impression of attentiveness. 
3904,1,A total of 20 participants took part in the robot-delivered motivational interview and evaluated it after 1 week by responding to a series of written open-ended questions. 
3905,1,"Each participant was left alone to speak aloud with the robot, advancing through a series of questions by tapping the robot's head sensor. "
3906,1,"Evaluations were content-analyzed utilizing Boyatzis' steps: (1) sampling and design, (2) developing themes and codes, and (3) validating and applying the codes."
3907,2,"Themes focused on interaction with the robot, motivation, change in physical activity, and overall evaluation of the intervention. "
3908,2,Participants found the instructions clear and the navigation easy to use. 
3909,2,Most enjoyed the interaction but also found it was restricted by the lack of individualized response from the robot. 
3910,2,Many positively appraised the nonjudgmental aspect of the interview and how it gave space to articulate their motivation for change. 
3911,2,Some participants felt that the intervention increased their physical activity levels.
3912,3,"Social robots can achieve a fundamental objective of motivational interviewing, encouraging participants to articulate their goals and dilemmas aloud. "
3913,3,"Because they are perceived as nonjudgmental, robots may have advantages over more humanoid avatars for delivering virtual support for behavioral change."
3914,4,Evaluation of Technology-Enhanced Learning Programs for Health Care Professionals: Systematic Review
3915,0,"Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) programs are increasingly seen as the way in which education for health care professionals can be transformed, giving access to effective ongoing learning and training even where time or geographical barriers exist. "
3916,0,"Given the increasing emphasis on this mode of educational support for health care practitioners, it is vital that we can effectively evaluate and measure impact to ensure that TEL programs are effective and fit for purpose. "
3917,0,"This paper examines the current evidence base for the first time, in relation to the evaluation of TEL programs for health care professionals."
3918,1,This review employed specific search criteria to identify research studies that included evaluation of TEL for health care professionals. 
3919,1,"The databases searched included Medline Ovid, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus Advanced, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, ZETOC, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Explore Digital Library, Allied and Complementary Medicine, and Education Resources Information Center between January 2006 and January 2017. "
3920,1,An additional hand search for relevant articles from reference lists was undertaken. 
3921,1,Each of the studies identified was critically appraised for quality using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. 
3922,1,This approach produced a percentage total score for each study across specified categories. 
3923,1,A proportion of the studies were independently assessed by an additional two reviewers.
3924,2,The review identified 21 studies that met the inclusion criteria. 
3925,2,The studies included scored totals across eight categories within a range of 37%-95% and an average score of 68%. 
3926,2,"Studies that measured TEL using learner satisfaction surveys, or combined pretest and posttest knowledge score testing with learner satisfaction surveys, were found to be the most common types of TEL evaluations evident in the literature. "
3927,2,"The studies reviewed had low scores across reporting on ethical matters, design, and data collection categories."
3928,3,"There continues to be a need to develop effective and standard TEL evaluation tools, and good quality studies that describe effective evaluation of TEL education for health care professionals. "
3929,3,Studies often fail to provide sufficient detail to support transferability or direct future TEL health care education programs.
3930,4,Harnessing Reddit to Understand the Written-Communication Challenges Experienced by Individuals With Mental Health Disorders: Analysis of Texts From Mental Health Communities
3931,0,"Mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are common, incapacitating, and have the potential to be fatal. "
3932,0,"Despite the prevalence and gravity of mental disorders, our knowledge concerning everyday challenges associated with them is relatively limited. "
3933,0,"One of the most studied deficits related to everyday challenges is language impairment, yet we do not know how mental disorders can impact common forms of written communication, for example, social media."
3934,1,"We examined lexical diversity and readability, both important features for measuring the quality of writing. "
3935,1,We used four well-established readability metrics that consider word frequencies and syntactic complexity to measure writers' written communication ability. 
3936,1,We then measured the lexical diversity by calculating the percentage of unique words in posts. 
3937,1,"To compare lexical diversity and readability among communities, we first applied pairwise independent sample t tests, followed by P value adjustments using the prespecified Hommel procedure to adjust for multiple comparison. "
3938,1,"To measure the changes, we applied linear least squares regression to the readability and lexical diversity scores against the interaction sequence for each member, followed by pairwise independent sample t tests and P value adjustments. "
3939,1,"Given the large sample of members, we also report effect sizes and 95% CIs for the pairwise comparisons."
3940,2,"On average, members of depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia communities showed indications of difficulty expressing their ideas compared with three other online health communities. "
3941,2,Our results also suggest that participating in these platforms has the potential to improve members' written communication. 
3942,2,"For example, members of all three mental health communities showed statistically significant improvement in both lexical diversity and readability compared with members of the OHC focusing on positive emotion."
3943,3,"We provide new insights into the written communication challenges faced by individuals suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. "
3944,3,"A comparison with three other online health communities suggests that written communication in mental health communities is significantly more difficult to read, while also consisting of a significantly less diverse lexicon. "
3945,3,We contribute practical suggestions for utilizing our findings in Web-based communication settings to enhance members' communicative experience. 
3946,3,We consider these findings to be an important step toward understanding and addressing everyday written communication challenges among individuals suffering from mental disorders.
3947,4,The Efficacy of Electronic Health-Supported Home Exercise Interventions for Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Knee: Systematic Review
3948,0,"Osteoarthritis of the knee is the most common cause for disability and limited mobility in the elderly, with considerable individual suffering and high direct and indirect disease-related costs. "
3949,0,"Nonsurgical interventions such as exercise, enhanced physical activity, and self-management have shown beneficial effects for pain reduction, physical function, and quality of life (QoL), but access to these treatments may be limited. "
3950,0,"Therefore, home therapy is strongly recommended. "
3951,0,"However, adherence to these programs is low. "
3952,0,"Patients report lack of motivation, feedback, and personal interaction as the main barriers to home therapy adherence. "
3953,0,"To overcome these barriers, electronic health (eHealth) is seen as a promising opportunity. "
3954,0,"Although beneficial effects have been shown in the literature for other chronic diseases such as chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, a systematic literature review on the efficacy of eHealth interventions for patients with osteoarthritis of knee is missing so far."
3955,1,"MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PEDro were systematically searched using the keywords osteoarthritis knee, eHealth, and exercise. "
3956,1,An inverse variance random-effects meta-analysis was carried out pooling standardized mean differences (SMDs) of individual studies. 
3957,1,"The Cochrane tool was used to assess risk of bias in individual studies, and the quality of evidence across studies was evaluated following the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach."
3958,2,The literature search yielded a total of 648 results. 
3959,2,"After screening of titles, abstracts, and full-texts, seven randomized controlled trials were included. "
3960,2,"Pooling the data of individual studies demonstrated beneficial short-term (pain SMD=-0.31, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.04, low quality; QoL SMD=0.24, 95% CI 0.05-0.43, moderate quality) and long-term effects (pain -0.30, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.53, moderate quality; physical function 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-0.64, high quality; and QoL SMD= 0.27, 95% CI 0.06-0.47, high quality)."
3961,3,"eHealth-supported exercise interventions resulted in less pain, improved physical function, and health-related QoL compared with no or other interventions; however, these improvements were small (SMD<0.5) and may not make a meaningful difference for individual patients. "
3962,3,Low adherence is seen as one limiting factor of eHealth interventions. 
3963,3,Future research should focus on participatory development of eHealth technology integrating evidence-based principles of exercise science and ways of increasing patient motivation and adherence.
3964,4,"Developing a Shared Patient-Centered, Web-Based Medication Platform for Type 2 Diabetes Patients and Their Health Care Providers: Qualitative Study on User Requirements"
3965,0,"Information technology tools such as shared patient-centered, Web-based medication platforms hold promise to support safe medication use by strengthening patient participation, enhancing patients' knowledge, helping patients to improve self-management of their medications, and improving communication on medications among patients and health care professionals (HCPs). "
3966,0,"However, the uptake of such platforms remains a challenge also due to inadequate user involvement in the development process. "
3967,0,Employing a user-centered design (UCD) approach is therefore critical to ensure that user' adoption is optimal.
3968,1,"This qualitative study included focus groups with purposeful samples of patients with T2DM (n=25), general practitioners (n=13), and health care assistants (n=10) recruited from regional health care settings in southwestern Germany. "
3969,1,"In total, 8 semistructured focus groups were conducted. "
3970,1,"Sessions were audio-and video-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to a computer-aided qualitative content analysis."
3971,2,"Appropriate security and access methods, supported data entry, printing, and sending information electronically, and tracking medication history were perceived as the essential functionalities. "
3972,2,"Although patients wanted automatic interaction checks and safety alerts, HCPs on the contrary were concerned that unspecific alerts confuse patients and lead to nonadherence. "
3973,2,"Furthermore, HCPs were opposed to patients' ability to withhold or restrict access to information in the platform. "
3974,2,"To optimize usability, there was consensus among participants to display information in a structured, chronological format, to provide information in lay language, to use visual aids and customize information content, and align the platform to users' workflow."
3975,3,"By employing a UCD, this study provides insight into the desired functionalities and usability of patients and HCPs regarding a shared patient-centered, Web-based medication platform, thus increasing the likelihood to achieve a functional and useful system. "
3976,3,"Substantial and ongoing engagement by all intended user groups is necessary to reconcile differences in requirements of patients and HCPs, especially regarding medication safety alerts and access control. "
3977,3,"Moreover, effective training of patients and HCPs on medication self-management (support) and optimal use of the tool will be a prerequisite to unfold the platform's full potential."
3978,4,"Clinical Validity, Understandability, and Actionability of Online Cardiovascular Disease Risk Calculators: Systematic Review"
3979,0,"Online health information is particularly important for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, where lifestyle changes are recommended until risk becomes high enough to warrant pharmacological intervention. "
3980,0,"Online information is abundant, but the quality is often poor and many people do not have adequate health literacy to access, understand, and use it effectively."
3981,1,This systematic review of public websites from August to November 2016 used evaluation of clinical validity based on a high-risk patient profile and assessment of understandability and actionability using Patient Education Material Evaluation Tool for Print Materials.
3982,2,A total of 67 unique webpages and 73 unique CVD risk calculators were identified. 
3983,2,"The same high-risk patient profile produced widely variable CVD risk estimates, ranging from as little as 3% to as high as a 43% risk of a CVD event over the next 10 years. "
3984,2,One-quarter (25%) of risk calculators did not specify what model these estimates were based on. 
3985,2,"The most common clinical model was Framingham (44%), and most calculators (77%) provided a 10-year CVD risk estimate. "
3986,2,The calculators scored moderately on understandability (mean score 64%) and poorly on actionability (mean score 19%). 
3987,2,"The absolute percentage risk was stated in most (but not all) calculators (79%), and only 18% included graphical formats consistent with recommended risk communication guidelines."
3988,3,"There is a plethora of online CVD risk calculators available, but they are not readily understandable and their actionability is poor. "
3989,3,Entering the same clinical information produces widely varying results with little explanation. 
3990,3,Developers need to address actionability as well as clinical validity and understandability to improve usefulness to consumers with low health literacy.
3991,4,"Users, Uses, and Effects of Social Media in Dietetic Practice: Scoping Review of the Quantitative and Qualitative Evidence"
3992,0,Social media platforms are increasingly used by registered dietitians (RDs) to improve knowledge translation and exchange in nutrition. 
3993,0,"However, a thorough understanding of social media in dietetic practice is lacking."
3994,1,"Stages for conducting the scoping review included the following: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies through a comprehensive multidatabase and gray literature search strategy; (3) selecting eligible studies; (4) charting the data; and (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting results for dissemination. "
3995,1,"Finally, knowledge users (RDs working for dietetic professional associations and public health organizations) were involved in each review stage to generate practical findings."
3996,2,"Of the 47 included studies, 34 were intervention studies, 4 were descriptive studies, 2 were content analysis studies, and 7 were expert opinion papers in dietetic practice. "
3997,2,"Discussion forums were the most frequent social media platform evaluated (n=19), followed by blogs (n=13) and social networking sites (n=10). "
3998,2,"Most studies targeted overweight and obese or healthy users, with adult populations being most studied. "
3999,2,Social media platforms were used to deliver content as part of larger multiple component interventions for weight management. 
4000,2,"Among intervention studies using a control group with no exposition to social media, we identified positive, neutral, and mixed effects of social media for outcomes related to users' health behaviors and status (eg, dietary intakes and body weight), participation rates, and professional knowledge. "
4001,2,"Factors associated with the characteristics of the specific social media, such as ease of use, a design for quick access to desired information, and concurrent reminders of use, were perceived as the main facilitators to the use of social media in dietetic practice, followed to a lesser extent by interactions with an RD and social support from fellow users. "
4002,2,Barriers to social media use were mostly related to complicated access to the site and time issues.
4003,3,"Research on social media in dietetic practice is at its infancy, but it is growing fast. "
4004,3,"So far, this field of research has targeted few social media platforms, most of which were assessed in multiple-component interventions for weight management among overweight or obese adults. "
4005,3,Trials isolating the effects and mechanisms of action of specific social media platforms are needed to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of those tools to support dietetic practice. 
4006,3,Future studies should address barriers and facilitators related to the use of social media written by RDs and should explore how to make these tools useful for RDs to reach health consumers to improve health through diet.
4007,4,Consumer Adoption of Future MyData-Based Preventive eHealth Services: An Acceptance Model and Survey Study
4008,0,Constantly increasing health care costs have led countries and health care providers to the point where health care systems must be reinvented. 
4009,0,"Consequently, electronic health (eHealth) has recently received a great deal of attention in social sciences in the domain of Internet studies. "
4010,0,"However, only a fraction of these studies focuses on the acceptability of eHealth, making consumers' subjective evaluation an understudied field. "
4011,0,This study will address this gap by focusing on the acceptance of MyData-based preventive eHealth services from the consumer point of view. 
4012,0,"We are adopting the term ""MyData"", which according to a White Paper of the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communication refers to ""1) a new approach, a paradigm shift in personal data management and processing that seeks to transform the current organization centric system to a human centric system, 2) to personal data as a resource that the individual can access and control."""
4013,1,"We applied a new adoption model combining Venkatesh's unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) in a consumer context and three constructs from health behavior theories, namely threat appraisals, self-efficacy, and perceived barriers. "
4014,1,"To test the research model, we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) with Mplus software, version 7.4. "
4015,1,A Web-based survey was administered. 
4016,1,We collected 855 responses.
4017,2,"We first applied traditional SEM for the research model, which was not statistically significant. "
4018,2,We then tested for possible heterogeneity in the data by running a mixture analysis. 
4019,2,We found that heterogeneity was not the cause for the poor performance of the research model. 
4020,2,"Thus, we moved on to model-generating SEM and ended up with a statistically significant empirical model (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] 0.051, Tucker-Lewis index [TLI] 0.906, comparative fit index [CFI] 0.915, and standardized root mean square residual 0.062). "
4021,2,"According to our empirical model, the statistically significant drivers for behavioral intention were effort expectancy (beta=.191, P<.001), self-efficacy (beta=.449, P<.001), threat appraisals (beta=.416, P<.001), and perceived barriers (beta=-.212, P=.009)."
4022,3,Our research highlighted the importance of health-related factors when it comes to eHealth technology adoption in the consumer context. 
4023,3,Emphasis should especially be placed on efforts to increase consumers' self-efficacy in eHealth technology use and in supporting healthy behavior.
4024,4,Self-Guided Web-Based Interventions: Scoping Review on User Needs and the Potential of Embodied Conversational Agents to Address Them
4025,0,Web-based mental health interventions have evolved from innovative prototypes to evidence-based and clinically applied solutions for mental diseases such as depression and anxiety. 
4026,0,"Open-access, self-guided types of these solutions hold the promise of reaching and treating a large population at a reasonable cost. "
4027,0,"However, a considerable factor that currently hinders the effectiveness of these self-guided Web-based interventions is the high level of nonadherence. "
4028,0,The absence of a human caregiver apparently has a negative effect on user adherence. 
4029,0,It is unknown to what extent this human support can be handed over to the technology of the intervention to mitigate this negative effect.
4030,1,This study reviews and interprets the available literature on (1) support within eHealth interventions that require repeated use and (2) the potential of ECAs by means of a scoping review. 
4031,1,"The rationale for choosing a scoping review is that the subject is broad, diverse, and largely unexplored. "
4032,1,Themes for (1) and (2) were proposed based on grounded theory and mapped on each other to find relationships.
4033,2,The results of the first part of this study suggest the presence of user needs that largely remain implicit and unaddressed. 
4034,2,These support needs can be categorized as task-related support and emotion-related support. 
4035,2,The results of the second part of this study suggest that ECAs are capable of engaging and motivating users of information technology applications in the domains of learning and behavioral change. 
4036,2,Longitudinal studies must be conducted to determine under what circumstances ECAs can create and maintain a productive user relationship. 
4037,2,Mapping the user needs on the ECAs' capabilities suggests that different kinds of ECAs may provide different solutions for improving the adherence levels.
4038,3,Autonomous ECAs that do not respond to a user's expressed emotion in real time but take on empathic roles may be sufficient to motivate users to some extent. 
4039,3,It is unclear whether those types of ECAs are competent enough and create sufficient believability among users to address the user's deeper needs for support and empathy. 
4040,3,Responsive ECAs may offer a better solution. 
4041,3,"However, at present, most of these ECAs have difficulties to assess a user's emotional state in real time during an open dialogue. "
4042,3,"By conducting future research with relationship theory-based ECAs, the added value of ECAs toward user needs can be better understood."
4043,4,Web-Based Information on the Treatment of Tobacco Dependence for Oral Health Professionals: Analysis of English-Written Websites
4044,0,Studies have been conducted on the content and quality of Web-based information for patients who are interested in smoking cessation advice and for health care practitioners regarding the content of e-learning programs about tobacco cessation. 
4045,0,"However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such information about the quality of Web-based learning resources regarding smoking cessation dedicated to oral health professionals."
4046,1,Websites were identified using Google and Health on Net (HON) search engines using the terms: smoking cessation OR quit smoking OR stop smoking OR 3As OR 5As OR tobacco counselling AND dentistry OR dental clinic OR dentist OR dental hygienist OR oral health professionals. 
4047,1,The first 100 consecutive results of the 2 search engines were considered for the study. 
4048,1,"Quality assessment was rated using the DISCERN questionnaire, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmarks, and the HON seal. "
4049,1,"In addition, smoking cessation content on each site was assessed using an abbreviated version of the Smoke Treatment Scale (STS-C) and the Smoking Treatment Scale-Rating (STS-R). "
4050,1,"To assess legibility of the selected websites, the Flesch Reading Ease (FRES) and the Flesch-Kinkaid Reading Grade Level (FKRGL) were used. "
4051,1,Websites were also classified into multimedia and nonmultimedia and friendly and nonfriendly usability.
4052,2,"Of the first 200 sites selected (100 of Google and 100 of HON), only 11 met the inclusion criteria and mainly belonged to governmental institutions (n=8), with the others being prepared by Professional Associations (n=2) and nonprofit organizations (n=1). "
4053,2,Only 3 were exclusively dedicated to smoking cessation. 
4054,2,"The average score obtained with the DISCERN was 3.0, and the average score in the FKRGL and FRES was 13.31 (standard deviation, SD 3.34) and 40.73 (SD 15.46), respectively. "
4055,2,"Of the 11 websites evaluated, none achieved all the four JAMA benchmarks. "
4056,2,The mean score of STS-R among all the websites was 2.81 (SD 0.95) out of 5. 
4057,2,"A significant strong positive correlation was obtained between the DISCERN mean values and the STS-R (R= .89, P= .01)."
4058,3,The mean quality of webpages with information for oral health care professionals about smoking cessation is low and displayed a high heterogeneity. 
4059,3,"These webpages are also difficult to read and often lack multimedia resources, which further limits their usefulness."
4060,4,eHealth System for Collecting and Utilizing Patient Reported Outcome Measures for Personalized Treatment and Care (PROMPT-Care) Among Cancer Patients: Mixed Methods Approach to Evaluate Feasibility and Acceptability
4061,0,"Despite accumulating evidence indicating that collecting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and transferring results to the treating health professional in real time has the potential to improve patient well-being and cancer outcomes, this practice is not widespread."
4062,1,"We developed an eHealth system in consultation with content-specific expert advisory groups and tested it with patients receiving treatment or follow-up care in two hospitals in New South Wales, Australia, over a 3-month period. "
4063,1,Participants were recruited in clinic and completed self-report Web-based assessments either just before their upcoming clinical consultation or every 4 weeks if in follow-up care. 
4064,1,"A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of PROMPT-Care; data collected throughout the study informed the accuracy and completeness of data transfer procedures, and extent of missing data was determined from participants' assessments. "
4065,1,"Patients participated in cognitive interviews while completing their first assessment and completed evaluation surveys and interviews at study-end to assess system acceptability and usefulness of patient self-management resources, and oncology staff were interviewed at study-end to determine the acceptability and perceived usefulness of real-time PRO reporting."
4066,2,A total of 42 patients consented to the study; 7 patients were withdrawn before starting the intervention primarily because of changes in eligibility. 
4067,2,"Overall, 35 patients (13 on treatment and 22 in follow-up) completed 67 assessments during the study period. "
4068,2,"Mean completeness of patient-reported data was 93%, with 100% accuracy of data transfer. "
4069,2,"Ten patients completed cognitive interviews, 28 completed evaluation surveys, and 14 completed evaluation interviews at study-end. "
4070,2,"PROMPT-Care patient acceptability was high-100% (28/28) reported the time to complete the Web-based assessments (average 15 min) as about right, most willing to answer more questions (79%, 22/28 yes), 96% (27/28) found the Web-based assessment easier or same as completing a paper copy, and they valued the self-management resources. "
4071,2,Oncology staff (n=5) also reported high acceptability and potential feasibility of the system.
4072,3,"Patients and oncology staff found the PROMPT-Care system to be highly acceptable, and the results suggest that it would be feasible to implement it into an oncology setting. "
4073,3,"Suggested modifications to the patient assessment survey, clinician access to the reports, and system requirements will be made as part of the next stage of large-scale testing and future implementation of the system as part of routine care."
4074,4,Improving Employee Well-Being and Effectiveness: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Web-Based Psychological Interventions Delivered in the Workplace
4075,0,"Stress, depression, and anxiety among working populations can result in reduced work performance and increased absenteeism. "
4076,0,"Although there is evidence that these common mental health problems are preventable and treatable in the workplace, uptake of psychological treatments among the working population is low. "
4077,0,One way to address this may be the delivery of occupational digital mental health interventions. 
4078,0,"While there is convincing evidence for delivering digital psychological interventions within a health and community context, there is no systematic review or meta-analysis of these interventions in an occupational setting."
4079,1,A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Cochrane guidelines. 
4080,1,"Papers published from January 2000 to May 2016 were searched in the PsychINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed, Science Direct, and the Cochrane databases, as well as the databases of the researchers and relevant websites. "
4081,1,Unpublished data was sought using the Conference Proceedings Citation Index and the Clinical Trials and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) research registers. 
4082,1,A meta-analysis was conducted by applying a random-effects model to assess the pooled effect size for psychological well-being and the work effectiveness outcomes. 
4083,1,A positive deviance approach was used to identify those intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and adherence.
4084,2,"In total, 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the search criteria. "
4085,2,"Occupational digital mental health interventions had a statistically significant effect post intervention on both psychological well-being (g=0.37, 95% CI 0.23-0.50) and work effectiveness (g=0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.41) compared with the control condition. "
4086,2,"No statistically significant differences were found on either outcome between studies using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches (as defined by the authors) compared with other psychological approaches, offering guidance compared with self-guidance, or recruiting from a targeted workplace population compared with a universal workplace population. "
4087,2,"In-depth analysis of the interventions identified by the positive deviance approach suggests that interventions that offer guidance are delivered over a shorter time frame (6 to 7 weeks), utilize secondary modalities for delivering the interventions and engaging users (ie, emails and text messages [short message service, SMS]), and use elements of persuasive technology (ie, self-monitoring and tailoring), which may achieve greater engagement and adherence."
4088,3,This review provides evidence that occupational digital mental health interventions can improve workers' psychological well-being and increase work effectiveness. 
4089,3,It identifies intervention characteristics that may increase engagement. 
4090,3,"Recommendations are made for future research, practice, and intervention development."
4091,4,Using Social Media to Characterize Public Sentiment Toward Medical Interventions Commonly Used for Cancer Screening: An Observational Study
4092,0,"Although cancer screening reduces morbidity and mortality, millions of people worldwide remain unscreened. "
4093,0,Social media provide a unique platform to understand public sentiment toward tools that are commonly used for cancer screening.
4094,1,"In this observational study, we classified 32,847 tweets (online postings on Twitter) related to colonoscopy, mammography, or Pap smears using a naive Bayes algorithm as containing positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. "
4095,1,"Additionally, we characterized the spread of sentiment on Twitter using an established model to study contagion."
4096,2,"Colonoscopy-related tweets were more likely to express negative than positive sentiment (negative to positive ratio 1.65, 95% CI 1.51-1.80, P<.001), in contrast to the more positive sentiment expressed regarding mammography (negative to positive ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.39-0.47, P<.001). "
4097,2,"The proportions of negative versus positive tweets about Pap smear were not significantly different (negative to positive ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.87-1.04, P=.18). "
4098,2,Positive and negative tweets tended to share lexical features across screening modalities. 
4099,2,Positive tweets expressed resonance with the benefits of early detection. 
4100,2,Fear and pain were the principal lexical features seen in negative tweets. 
4101,2,Negative sentiment for colonoscopy and mammography spread more than positive sentiment; no correlation with sentiment and spread was seen for Pap smear.
4102,3,"Analysis of social media data provides a unique, quantitative framework to better understand the public's perception of medical interventions that are commonly used for cancer screening. "
4103,3,"Given the growing use of social media, public health interventions to improve cancer screening should use the health perceptions of the population as expressed in social network postings about tests that are frequently used for cancer screening, as well as other people they may influence with such postings."
4104,4,The Second Victim Phenomenon After a Clinical Error: The Design and Evaluation of a Website to Reduce Caregivers Emotional Responses After a Clinical Error
4105,0,Adverse events (incidents that harm a patient) can also produce emotional hardship for the professionals involved (second victims). 
4106,0,"Although a few international pioneering programs exist that aim to facilitate the recovery of the second victim, there are no known initiatives that aim to raise awareness in the professional community about this issue and prevent the situation from worsening."
4107,1,"The design of the Mitigating Impact in Second Victims (MISE) online program was based on a literature review, and its contents were selected by a group of 15 experts on patient safety with experience in both clinical and academic settings. "
4108,1,The website hosting MISE was subjected to an accreditation process by an external quality agency that specializes in evaluating health websites. 
4109,1,"The MISE structure and content were evaluated by 26 patient safety managers at hospitals and within primary care in addition to 266 frontline health care professionals who followed the program, taking into account its comprehension, usefulness of the information, and general adequacy. "
4110,1,"Finally, the amount of knowledge gained from the program was assessed with three objective measures (pre- and posttest design)."
4111,2,The website earned Advanced Accreditation for health websites after fulfilling required standards. 
4112,2,"The comprehension and practical value of the MISE content were positively assessed by 88% (23/26) and 92% (24/26) of patient safety managers, respectively. "
4113,2,"MISE was positively evaluated by health care professionals, who awarded it 8.8 points out of a maximum 10. "
4114,2,"Users who finished MISE improved their knowledge on patient safety terminology, prevalence and impact of adverse events and clinical errors, second victim support models, and recommended actions following a severe adverse event (P<.001)."
4115,3,The MISE program differs from existing intervention initiatives by its preventive nature in relation to the second victim phenomenon. 
4116,3,Its online nature makes it an easily accessible tool for the professional community. 
4117,3,This program has shown to increase user's knowledge on this issue and it helps them correct their approach. 
4118,3,"Furthermore, it is one of the first initiatives to attempt to bring the second victim phenomenon closer to primary care."
4119,4,Understanding Health Care Social Media Use From Different Stakeholder Perspectives: A Content Analysis of an Online Health Community
4120,0,"Health care social media used for health information exchange and emotional communication involves different types of users, including patients, caregivers, and health professionals. "
4121,0,"However, it is difficult to identify different stakeholders because user identification data are lacking due to privacy protection and proprietary interests. "
4122,0,"Therefore, identifying the concerns of different stakeholders and how they use health care social media when confronted with huge amounts of health-related messages posted by users is a critical problem."
4123,1,"We collected 138,161 messages posted by 39,606 members in lung cancer, diabetes, and breast cancer forums in the online community MedHelp. "
4124,1,org over 10 years (January 2007 to October 2016) as experimental data. 
4125,1,"We used text mining techniques to process text data to identify different stakeholders and determine health-related hot topics, and then analyzed sentiment expression."
4126,2,"We identified 3 significantly different stakeholder groups using expectation maximization clustering (3 performance metrics: Rand = 0.802, Jaccard = 0.393, Fowlkes-Mallows = 0.537; P <. "
4127,2,"001), in which patients (24,429/39,606, 61.68%) and caregivers (12,232/39,606, 30.88%) represented the majority of the population, in contrast to specialists (2945/39,606, 7.43%). "
4128,2,"We identified 5 significantly different health-related topics: symptom, examination, drug, procedure, and complication (Rand = 0.783, Jaccard = 0.369, Fowlkes-Mallows = 0.495; P<. "
4129,2,001). 
4130,2,"Patients were concerned most about symptom topics related to lung cancer (536/1657, 32.34%), drug topics related to diabetes (1883/5904, 31.89%), and examination topics related to breast cancer (8728/23,934, 36.47%). "
4131,2,"By comparison, caregivers were more concerned about drug topics related to lung cancer (300/2721, 11.03% vs 109/1657, 6.58%), procedure topics related to breast cancer (3952/13,954, 28.32% vs 5822/23,934, 24.33%), and complication topics (4449/25,701, 17.31% vs 4070/31,495, 12.92%). "
4132,2,"In addition, patients (9040/36,081, 25.05%) were more likely than caregivers (2659/18,470, 14.39%) and specialists (17,943/83,610, 21.46%) to express their emotions. "
4133,2,"However, patients' sentiment intensity score (2.46) was lower than those of caregivers (4.66) and specialists (5.14). "
4134,2,"In particular, for caregivers, negative sentiment scores were higher than positive scores (2.56 vs 2.18), with the opposite among specialists (2.62 vs 2.46). "
4135,2,"Overall, the proportion of negative messages was greater than that of positive messages related to symptom, complication, and examination. "
4136,2,The pattern was opposite for drug and procedure topics. 
4137,2,A trend analysis showed that patients and caregivers gradually changed their emotional state in a positive direction.
4138,3,The hot topics of interest and sentiment expression differed significantly among different stakeholders in different disease forums. 
4139,3,These findings could help improve social media services to facilitate diverse stakeholder engagement for health information sharing and social interaction more effectively.
4140,4,Online Self-Tracking Groups to Increase Fruit and Vegetable Intake: A Small-Scale Study on Mechanisms of Group Effect on Behavior Change
4141,0,Web-based interventions with a self-tracking component have been found to be effective in promoting adults' fruit and vegetable consumption. 
4142,0,"However, these interventions primarily focus on individual-rather than group-based self-tracking. "
4143,0,The rise of social media technologies enables sharing and comparing self-tracking records in a group context. 
4144,0,"Therefore, we developed an online group-based self-tracking program to promote fruit and vegetable consumption."
4145,1,"During a 4-week Web-based experiment, 111 college students self-tracked their fruit and vegetable consumption either individually (ie, the control group) or in an online group characterized by a 2 (demographic similarity: demographically similar vs demographically diverse) x 2 (social modeling: incremental change vs ideal change) experimental design. "
4146,1,"Each online group consisted of one focal participant and three confederates as group members or peers, who had their demographics and fruit and vegetable consumption manipulated to create the four intervention groups. "
4147,1,Self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption were assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire at baseline and after the 4-week experiment.
4148,2,Participants who self-tracked their fruit and vegetable consumption collectively with other group members consumed more fruits and vegetables than participants who self-tracked individually (P=.01). 
4149,2,The results did not show significant main effects of demographic similarity (P=.32) or types of social modeling (P=.48) in making self-tracking groups more effective in promoting fruit and vegetable consumption. 
4150,2,"However, additional analyses revealed the main effect of performance discrepancy (ie, difference in fruit and vegetable consumption between a focal participant and his/her group members during the experiment), such that participants who had a low performance discrepancy from other group members had greater fruit and vegetable consumption than participants who had a high performance discrepancy from other group members (P=.002). "
4151,2,"A mediation test showed that low performance discrepancy led to greater downward contrast (b=-0.78, 95% CI -2.44 to -0.15), which in turn led to greater fruit and vegetable consumption."
4152,3,Online self-tracking groups were more effective than self-tracking alone in promoting fruit and vegetable consumption for early young adults. 
4153,3,"Low performance discrepancy from other group members lead to downward contrast, which in turn increased participants' fruit and vegetable consumption over time. "
4154,3,The study highlighted social comparison processes in online groups that allow for sharing personal health information. 
4155,3,"Lastly, given the small scale of this study, nonsignificant results with small effect sizes might be subject to bias."
4156,4,The Association Between Internet Use and Ambulatory Care-Seeking Behaviors in Taiwan: A Cross-Sectional Study
4157,0,"Compared with the traditional ways of gaining health-related information from newspapers, magazines, radio, and television, the Internet is inexpensive, accessible, and conveys diverse opinions. "
4158,0,Several studies on how increasing Internet use affected outpatient clinic visits were inconclusive.
4159,1,We conducted this study using a sample randomly selected from the general population in Taiwan. 
4160,1,"To handle the missing data, we built a multivariate logistic regression model for propensity score matching using age and sex as the independent variables. "
4161,1,The questionnaires with no missing data were then included in a multivariate linear regression model for examining the association between Internet use and outpatient clinic visits.
4162,2,We included a sample of 293 participants who answered the questionnaire with no missing data in the multivariate linear regression model. 
4163,2,We found that Internet use was significantly associated with more outpatient clinic visits (P=.04). 
4164,2,The participants with chronic diseases tended to make more outpatient clinic visits (P<.01).
4165,3,"The inconsistent quality of health-related information obtained from the Internet may be associated with patients' increasing need for interpreting and discussing the information with health care professionals, thus resulting in an increasing number of outpatient clinic visits. "
4166,3,"In addition, the media literacy of Web-based health-related information seekers may also affect their ambulatory care-seeking behaviors, such as outpatient clinic visits."
4167,4,Linked Patient-Reported Outcomes Data From Patients With Multiple Sclerosis Recruited on an Open Internet Platform to Health Care Claims Databases Identifies a Representative Population for Real-Life Data Analysis in Multiple Sclerosis
4168,0,An enormous amount of information relevant to public health is being generated directly by online communities.
4169,1,US Facebook users with an interest in MS were alerted to a patient-reported survey by targeted advertisements. 
4170,1,"Eligibility criteria were diagnosis of MS by a specialist (primary progressive, relapsing-remitting, or secondary progressive), >= 12-month history of disease, age 18-65 years, and commercial health insurance. "
4171,1,"Participants completed a questionnaire including data on demographic and disease characteristics, current and earlier therapies, relapses, disability, health-related quality of life, and employment status and productivity. "
4172,1,A unique anonymous profile was generated for each survey respondent. 
4173,1,Each anonymous profile was linked to a number of medical and pharmacy claims datasets in the United States. 
4174,1,Linkage rates were assessed and survey respondents' representativeness was evaluated based on differences in the distribution of characteristics between the linked survey population and the general MS population in the claims databases.
4175,2,"The advertisement was placed on 1,063,973 Facebook users' pages generating 68,674 clicks, 3719 survey attempts, and 651 successfully completed surveys, of which 440 could be linked to any of the claims databases for 2014 or 2015 (67.6% linkage rate). "
4176,2,"Overall, no significant differences were found between patients who were linked and not linked for educational status, ethnicity, current or prior disease-modifying therapy (DMT) treatment, or presence of a relapse in the last 12 months. "
4177,2,The frequencies of the most common MS symptoms did not differ significantly between linked patients and the general MS population in the databases. 
4178,2,Linked patients were slightly younger and less likely to be men than those who were not linkable.
4179,3,"Linking patient-reported outcomes data, from a Web-based survey of US patients with MS recruited on open Internet platforms, to health care utilization information from claims databases may enable rapid generation of a large population of representative patients with MS suitable for outcomes analysis."
4180,4,Effectiveness of Web-Delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in Relation to Mental Health and Well-Being: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
4181,0,The need for effective interventions to improve mental health and emotional well-being at a population level are gaining prominence both in the United Kingdom and globally. 
4182,0,Advances in technology and widespread adoption of Internet capable devices have facilitated rapid development of Web-delivered psychological therapies. 
4183,0,Interventions designed to manage a range of affective disorders by applying diverse therapeutic approaches are widely available.
4184,2,The search strategy identified 59 articles. 
4185,2,"Of these, 10 articles met the inclusion criteria specified. "
4186,2,The range of conditions and outcome measures that were identified limited the ability to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of Web-delivered ACT-based intervention for anxiety or well-being.
4187,3,ACT in a Web-based delivery format was found to be effective in the management of depression. 
4188,3,Rates of adherence to study protocols and completion were high overall suggesting that this therapeutic approach is highly acceptable for patients and the general public.
4189,4,Frequent Surfing on Social Health Networks is Associated With Increased Knowledge and Patient Health Activation
4190,0,The advent of the Internet has driven a technological revolution that has changed our lives. 
4191,0,"As part of this phenomenon, social networks have attained a prominent role in health care. "
4192,0,"A variety of medical services is provided over the Internet, including home monitoring, interactive communications between the patient and service providers, and social support, among others. "
4193,0,This study emphasizes some of the practical implications of Web-based health social networks for patients and for health care systems.
4194,1,"A prospective, cross-sectional survey with a retrospective component was conducted. "
4195,1,"Data were collected from Camoni, a Hebrew-language Web-based social health network, participants in the diabetes mellitus, pain, hypertension, and depression/anxiety forums, during November 2012 to 2013. "
4196,1,Experienced users (enrolled at least 6 months) and newly enrolled received similar versions of the same questionnaire including sociodemographics and PAM.
4197,2,"Among 686 participants, 154 of 337 experienced and 123 of 349 newly enrolled completed the questionnaire. "
4198,2,"Positive correlations (P<.05) were found between frequency and duration of site visits and patient activation, social relationships, and chronic disease knowledge. "
4199,2,"Men surfed longer than women (chi(2)(3) = 10.104, P<.05). "
4200,2,"Experienced users with diabetes surfed more than those with other illnesses and had significantly higher PAM scores (mean, M=69.3, standard deviation, SD=19.1, PAM level 4; Z=-4.197, P<.001) than new users (M=62.8, SD=18.7, PAM level 3). "
4201,2,"Disease knowledge directly predicted PAM for all users (beta=.26 and .21, respectively). "
4202,2,Frequency and duration of social health network use were correlated with increased knowledge about a chronic disease. 
4203,2,"Experienced surfers had higher PAM than newly enrolled, suggesting that continued site use may contribute to increased activation."
4204,3,"Web-based social health networks offer an opportunity to expand patient knowledge and increase involvement in personal health, thereby increasing patient activation. "
4205,3,Further studies are needed to examine these changes on other aspects of chronic illnesses such as quality of life and costs.
4206,4,Mechanisms of Communicating Health Information Through Facebook: Implications for Consumer Health Information Technology Design
4207,0,Consumer health information technology (IT) solutions are designed to support patient health management and have the ability to facilitate patients' health information communication with their social networks. 
4208,0,"However, there is a need for consumer health IT solutions to align with patients' health management preferences for increased adoption of the technology. "
4209,0,"It may be possible to gain an understanding of patients' needs for consumer health IT supporting their health information communication with social networks by explicating how they have adopted and adapted social networking sites, such as Facebook, for this purpose."
4210,1,"This study analyzed data about Facebook communication mechanisms use from a larger, three-phase, sequential, mixed-methods study. "
4211,1,We report here on the results of the study's first phase: qualitative interviews (N=25). 
4212,1,"Participants were over 18, used Facebook, were residents or citizens of the United States, spoke English, and had a diagnosis consistent with type 2 diabetes. "
4213,1,Participants were recruited through Facebook groups and pages. 
4214,1,Participant interviews were conducted via Skype or telephone between July and September 2014. 
4215,1,Data analysis was grounded in qualitative content analysis and the initial coding framework was informed by the findings of a previous study.
4216,2,"Participants' rationales for the use or disuse of a particular Facebook mechanism to communicate health information reflected six broad themes: (1) characteristics and circumstances of the person, (2) characteristics and circumstances of the relationship, (3) structure and composition of the social network, (4) content of the information, (5) communication purpose, and (6) attributes of the technology."
4217,3,The results of this study showed that participants consider multiple factors when choosing a Facebook mechanism for health information communication. 
4218,3,"Factors included what information they intended to share, what they were trying to accomplish, attributes of technology, and attributes and communication practices of their social networks. "
4219,3,There is a need for consumer health IT that allows for a range of choices to suit the intersectionality of participants' rationales. 
4220,3,"Technology that better meets patients' needs may lead to better self-management of health conditions, and therefore, improve overall health outcomes."
4221,4,Paper-Based Survivorship Care Plans May be Less Helpful for Cancer Patients Who Search for Disease-Related Information on the Internet: Results of the Registrationsystem Oncological Gynecology (ROGY) Care Randomized Trial
4222,0,The Institute of Medicine recommends Survivorship Care Plans (SCPs) for all cancer survivors. 
4223,0,"However, it is unclear whether certain patient groups may or may not benefit from SCPs."
4224,1,Twelve hospitals were randomized to either SCP care or usual care in the pragmatic cluster randomized Registrationsystem Oncological GYnecology (ROGY) Care trial. 
4225,1,"Newly diagnosed endometrial cancer patients completed questionnaires after diagnosis (N=221; response: 74.7%, 221/296), 6 months (n=158), and 12 months (n=147), including patients' satisfaction with information provision and care, illness perceptions, health care utilization (how many times patients visited a medical specialist or primary care physician about their cancer in the past 6 months), and disease-related Internet use (whether patients used the Internet to look for information about cancer)."
4226,2,"In total, 80 of 221 (36.2%) patients used the Internet to obtain disease-related information. "
4227,2,"Disease-related Internet use moderated the SCP care effect on the amount of information received about the disease (P=.03) and medical tests (P=.01), helpfulness of the information (P=.01), and how well patients understood their illness (P=.04). "
4228,2,All stratified analyses were not statistically significant. 
4229,2,"However, it appeared that patients who did not seek disease-related information on the Internet in the SCP care arm reported receiving more information about their disease (mean 63.9, SD 20.1 vs mean 58.3, SD 23.7) and medical tests (mean 70.6, SD 23.5 vs mean 64.7, SD 24.9), finding the information more helpful (76.7, SD 22.9 vs mean 67.8, SD 27.2; scale 0-100), and understanding their illness better (mean 6.6, SD 3.0 vs mean 6.1, SD 3.2; scale 1-10) than patients in the usual care arm did. "
4230,2,"In addition, although all stratified analyses were not significant, patients who did seek disease-related information on the Internet in the SCP care arm appeared to receive less information about their disease (mean 65.7, SD 23.4 vs mean 67.1, SD 20.7) and medical tests (mean 72.4, SD 23.5 vs mean 75.3, SD 21.6), did not find the information more helpful (mean 78.6, SD 21.2 vs mean 76.0, SD 22.0), and reported less understanding of their illness (mean 6.3, SD 2.8 vs mean 7.1, SD 2.7) than patients in the usual care arm did."
4231,3,"Paper SCPs appear to improve the amount of information received about the disease and medical tests, the helpfulness of the information, and understanding of the illness for patients who do not search for disease-related information on the Internet. "
4232,3,"In contrast, paper SCPs do not seem beneficial for patients who do seek disease-related information on the Internet."
4233,4,Exposure to Internet-Based Tobacco Advertising and Branding: Results From Population Surveys of Australian Youth 2010-2013
4234,0,"Since legislation prohibiting tobacco advertising in traditional media, online communication platforms and social media have become one of the few avenues for the tobacco industry to promote its products to Australians. "
4235,0,Little is currently known about the exposure of young people to these new media promotions.
4236,1,"The Tobacco Promotion Impact Study is a repeat cross-sectional telephone survey of young people (12-24 years) in 2 Australian states, conducted yearly from 2010 to 2013 (total n=8820). "
4237,1,The survey included questions about past-month exposure to Internet-based tobacco advertising and tobacco company branding. 
4238,1,"Changes in levels of exposure, characteristics of exposed youth, and the association between exposure and smoking susceptibility were explored."
4239,2,Past-month exposure to Internet-based tobacco advertising and branding among young people increased over the years of the survey (advertising: 21% in 2010 to 29% in 2013; branding: 20% in 2010 to 26% in 2013). 
4240,2,"The participants who were younger, female, from lower socioeconomic status, and never-smokers were more likely to report exposure. "
4241,2,Facebook was the most commonly cited platform for encountering tobacco branding in 2013 (22% of all branding). 
4242,2,"Compared with young people interviewed in 2013, participants in 2010 were significantly less likely to report exposure to tobacco branding on social media (odds ratio [OR] 0.26, 95% CI 0.20-0.33, P<.001) or 2011 (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.37-0.57, P<.001). "
4243,2,"Among never-smokers aged 12-17 years, exposure to online advertising and branding (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11-1.57, P=.002) or branding alone (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.10-1.77, P=.007) were significant predictors of smoking susceptibility."
4244,3,Ensuring tobacco advertising bans are inclusive of Internet-based media is essential. 
4245,3,"Given the global nature of Internet-based content, cooperation among signatory nations to the World Health Organization Framework Convention Alliance on Tobacco Control will be necessary."
4246,4,A Remote Medication Monitoring System for Chronic Heart Failure Patients to Reduce Readmissions: A Two-Arm Randomized Pilot Study
4247,0,Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition affecting nearly 5.7 million Americans and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. 
4248,0,"With an aging population, the cost associated with managing HF is expected to more than double from US $ 31 billion in 2012 to US $ 70 billion by 2030. "
4249,0,Readmission rates for HF patients are high-25% are readmitted at 30 days and nearly 50% at 6 months. 
4250,0,Low medication adherence contributes to poor HF management and higher readmission rates. 
4251,0,Remote telehealth monitoring programs aimed at improved medication management and adherence may improve HF management and reduce readmissions.
4252,1,Participants were randomized to usual care or use of the remote medication monitoring system for 90 days. 
4253,1,Twenty-nine participants were enrolled and the final analytic sample consisted of 25 participants. 
4254,1,"Participants completed questionnaires at enrollment and closeout to gather data on medication adherence, health status, and HRQoL. "
4255,1,Electronic medical records were reviewed for data on baseline classification of heart function and the number of unplanned hospitalizations and ED visits during the study period.
4256,2,Use of the medication monitoring system was associated with an 80% reduction in the risk of all-cause hospitalization and a significant decrease in the number of all-cause hospitalization length of stay in the intervention arm compared to usual care. 
4257,2,Objective device data indicated high adherence rates (95%-99%) among intervention group participants despite finding no significant difference in self-reported adherence between study arms. 
4258,2,"The intervention group had poorer heart function and HRQoL at baseline, and HRQoL declined significantly in the intervention group compared to controls."
4259,3,The MedSentry medication monitoring system is a promising technology that merits continued development and evaluation. 
4260,3,The MedSentry medication monitoring system may be useful both as a standalone system for patients with complex medication regimens or used to complement existing HF telemonitoring interventions. 
4261,3,We found significant reductions in risk of all-cause hospitalization and the number of all-cause length of stay in the intervention group compared to controls. 
4262,3,"Although HRQoL deteriorated significantly in the intervention group, this may have been due to the poorer HF-functioning at baseline in the intervention group compared to controls. "
4263,3,"Telehealth medication adherence technologies, such as the MedSentry medication monitoring system, are a promising method to improve patient self-management, the quality of patient care, and reduce health care utilization and expenditure for patients with HF and other chronic diseases that require complex medication regimens."
4264,4,A New Cuffless Device for Measuring Blood Pressure: A Real-Life Validation Study
4265,0,"Cuffless blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices, based on pulse transit time, are being developed as an easy-to-use, more convenient, fast, and relatively cheap alternative to conventional BP measuring devices based on cuff occlusion. "
4266,0,Thereby they may provide a great alternative to BP self-measurement.
4267,1,"Study volunteers fell into 3 BP ranges: high (> 160 mmHg), normal (130-160 mmHg), and low (< 130 mmHg). "
4268,1,"All requirements for test environment, observer qualification, volunteer recruitment, and BP measurements were met according to the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol (ESH-IP) for the validation of BP measurement devices. "
4269,1,"After calibrating the Checkme device, we measured systolic BP with Checkme and a validated, oscillometric reference BP monitor (RM). "
4270,1,"Measurements were performed in randomized order both in supine and in sitting position, and with Checkme at and above heart level."
4271,2,"We recruited 52 volunteers, of whom we excluded 15 (12 due to calibration failure with Checkme, 3 due to a variety of reasons). "
4272,2,"The remaining 37 volunteers were divided into low (n= 14), medium (n= 13), and high (n= 10) BP ranges. "
4273,2,"There were 18 men and 19 women, with a mean age of 54.1 (SD 14.5) years, and mean recruitment systolic BP of 141.7 (SD 24.7) mmHg. "
4274,2,BP results obtained by RM and Checkme correlated well. 
4275,2,"In the supine position, the difference between the RM and Checkme was > 5 mmHg in 17 of 37 volunteers (46%), of whom 9 of 37 (24%) had a difference > 10 mmHg and 5 of 37 (14%) had a difference > 15 mmHg."
4276,3,"BP obtained with Checkme correlated well with RM BP, particularly in the position (supine) in which the device was calibrated. "
4277,3,These preliminary results are promising for conducting further research on cuffless BP measurement in the clinical and outpatient settings.
4278,1,"A one-group, pretest-posttest study design was used. "
4279,1,Men who were interested in quitting were recruited and invited to use the website over a 6-month period. 
4280,1,"Data were collected via online questionnaires at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. "
4281,1,A total of 117 men completed the baseline survey. 
4282,1,"Over half of those (67/117, 57.3%) completed both follow-up surveys."
4283,2,"At baseline, participants (N= 117) had been smoking for an average of 24 years (SD 12.1) and smoked on average 15 cigarettes a day (SD 7.4). "
4284,2,"The majority had not previously used a quit smoking website (103/117, 88.0%) or websites focused on men's health (105/117, 89.7%). "
4285,2,"At the 6-month follow-up, the majority of men used the QuitNow Men website at least once (64/67, 96%). "
4286,2,"Among the 64 users, 29 (43%) reported using the website more than 6 times. "
4287,2,"The men using QuitNow Men agreed or strongly agreed that the website was easy to use (51/64, 80%), the design and images were appealing (42/64, 66%), they intended to continue to use the website (42/64, 66%), and that they would recommend QuitNow Men to others who wanted to quit (46/64, 72%). "
4288,2,Participants reported using an average of 8.76 (SD 4.08) of the 15 resources available on the website. 
4289,2,"At 6-month follow-up, 16 of the 67 participants (24%) had quit, 27 (40%) had reduced their smoking and 24 (36%) had not changed their smoking habits. "
4290,2,"Repeated measures general linear model showed a significant decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked between the 3-month and 6-month follow-up (F-1,F-63= 6.41, P=.01, eta squared= 0.09). "
4291,2,"Number of resources used on the website, quit confidence, nicotine dependence and age significantly predicted number of quit attempts by those still smoking at 6 months (F-4,F-45= 2.73, P=.04), with number of resources used being the strongest predictor (P=.02)."
4292,3,The results of this research support efforts to integrate gender-sensitive approaches in smoking cessation interventions and indicate that this novel Web-based resource has potential in supporting men's smoking cessation efforts.
4293,4,Effectiveness of a Web-Based Guided Self-help Intervention for Outpatients With a Depressive Disorder: Short-term Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial
4294,0,Research has convincingly demonstrated that symptoms of depression can be reduced through guided Internet-based interventions. 
4295,0,"However, most of those studies recruited people form the general population. "
4296,0,There is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness when delivered in routine clinical practice in outpatient clinics.
4297,1,"We recruited 269 outpatients, aged between 18 and 79 years, from outpatient clinics and randomly allocated them to Internet-based problem solving therapy (n = 136), with weekly student support, or to a control condition, who remained on the waitlist with a self-help booklet (control group; n = 133). "
4298,1,Participants in both conditions were allowed to take up face-to-face treatment at the outpatient clinics afterward. 
4299,1,"We measured the primary outcome, depressive symptoms, by Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). "
4300,1,"Secondary outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety subscale (HADS-A), Insomnia Severity Index questionnaire (ISI), and EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS). "
4301,1,All outcomes were assessed by telephone at posttest (8 weeks after baseline).
4302,2,Posttest measures were completed by 184 (68.4%) participants. 
4303,2,We found a moderate to large within-group effect size for both the intervention (d = 0.75) and the control (d = 0.69) group. 
4304,2,"However, the between-group effect size was very small (d = 0.07), and regression analysis on posttreatment CES-D scores revealed no significant differences between the groups (b = 1.134, 95% CI-2.495 to 4.763). "
4305,2,"The per-protocol analysis (>= 4 sessions completed) results were also not significant (b = 1.154, 95% CI-1.978 to 7.637). "
4306,2,Between-group differences were small and not significant for all secondary outcomes. 
4307,2,Adherence to the intervention was low. 
4308,2,Only 36% (49/136) received an adequate dosage of the intervention (>= 4 of 5 sessions). 
4309,2,The overall treatment satisfaction was moderate.
4310,3,Internet-based problem solving therapy is not more effective in reducing symptoms of depression than receiving an unguided self-help book during the waitlist period at outpatient mental health clinics. 
4311,3,"The effect sizes are much smaller than those found in earlier research in the general population, and the low rates of adherence indicate that the acceptability of the intervention at this stage of treatment for depressed outpatients is low. "
4312,3,"However, taking into account that there is much evidence for the efficacy of Internet-based treatments, it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of these treatments in outpatient clinics as a whole."
4313,4,Barriers and Facilitators to Online Portal Use Among Patients and Caregivers in a Safety Net Health Care System: A Qualitative Study
4314,0,Patient portals have the potential to support self-management for chronic diseases and improve health outcomes. 
4315,0,"With the rapid rise in adoption of patient portals spurred by meaningful use incentives among safety net health systems (a health system or hospital providing a significant level of care to low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable populations), it is important to understand the readiness and willingness of patients and caregivers in safety net settings to access their personal health records online."
4316,1,We conducted 16 in-depth interviews with chronic disease patients and caregivers who expressed interest in using the Internet to manage their health. 
4317,1,"Discussions focused on health care experiences, technology use, and interest in using an online portal to manage health tasks. "
4318,1,"We used open coding to categorize all the barriers and facilitators to portal use, followed by a second round of coding that compared the categories to previously published findings. "
4319,1,"In secondary analyses, we also examined specific barriers among 2 subgroups: those with limited health literacy and caregivers."
4320,2,We interviewed 11 patients and 5 caregivers. 
4321,2,"Patients were predominantly male (82%, 9/11) and African American (45%, 5/11). "
4322,2,"All patients had been diagnosed with diabetes and the majority had limited health literacy (73%, 8/11). "
4323,2,"The majority of caregivers were female (80%, 4/5), African American (60%, 3/5), caregivers of individuals with diabetes (60%, 3/5), and had adequate health literacy (60%, 3/5). "
4324,2,A total of 88% (14/16) of participants reported interest in using the portal after viewing a prototype. 
4325,2,"Major perceived barriers included security concerns, lack of technical skills/interest, and preference for in-person communication. "
4326,2,"Facilitators to portal use included convenience, health monitoring, and improvements in patient-provider communication. "
4327,2,"Participants with limited health literacy discussed more fundamental barriers to portal use, including challenges with reading and typing, personal experience with online security breaches/viruses, and distrust of potential security measures. "
4328,2,"Caregivers expressed high interest in portal use to support their roles in interpreting health information, advocating for quality care, and managing health behaviors and medical care."
4329,3,"Despite concerns about security, difficulty understanding medical information, and satisfaction with current communication processes, respondents generally expressed enthusiasm about portal use. "
4330,3,"Our findings suggest a strong need for training and support to assist vulnerable patients with portal registration and use, particularly those with limited health literacy. "
4331,3,Efforts to encourage portal use among vulnerable patients should directly address health literacy and security/privacy issues and support access for caregivers.
4332,4,Forecasting the Incidence of Dementia and Dementia-Related Outpatient Visits With Google Trends: Evidence From Taiwan
4333,0,Google Trends has demonstrated the capability to both monitor and predict epidemic outbreaks. 
4334,0,The connection between Internet searches for dementia information and dementia incidence and dementia-related outpatient visits remains unknown.
4335,1,"This study collected (1) dementia data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and (2) local Internet search data from Google Trends, both from January 2009 to December 2011. "
4336,1,We investigated and validated search terms that would be the best predictors of new dementia cases and outpatient visits. 
4337,1,We then evaluated both the nowcasting and the forecasting effects of Google Trends search trends through cross-correlation analysis of the dementia incidence and outpatient visit data with the Google Trends data.
4338,2,"The search term ""dementia + Alzheimer's disease"" demonstrated a 3-month lead effect for new dementia cases and a 6-month lead effect for outpatient visits (r=.503, P=.002; r=.431, P=.009, respectively). "
4339,2,"When gender was included in the analysis, the search term ""dementia"" showed 6-month predictive power for new female dementia cases (r=.520, P=.001), but only a nowcasting effect for male cases (r=.430, P=.009). "
4340,2,"The search term ""neurology"" demonstrated a 3-month leading effect for new dementia cases (r=.433, P=.008), for new male dementia cases (r=.434, P=.008), and for outpatient visits (r=.613, P<.001)."
4341,3,Google Trends established a plausible relationship between search terms and new dementia cases and dementia-related outpatient visits in Taiwan. 
4342,3,This data may allow the health care system in Taiwan to prepare for upcoming outpatient and dementia screening visits. 
4343,3,"In addition, the validated search term results can be used to provide caregivers with caregiving-related health, skills, and social welfare information by embedding dementia-related search keywords in relevant online articles."
4344,4,"Medical Content Searching, Retrieving, and Sharing Over the Internet: Lessons Learned From the mEducator Through a Scenario-Based Evaluation"
4345,0,"The mEducator Best Practice Network (BPN) implemented and extended standards and reference models in e-learning to develop innovative frameworks as well as solutions that enable specialized state-of-the-art medical educational content to be discovered, retrieved, shared, and re-purposed across European Institutions, targeting medical students, doctors, educators and health care professionals. "
4346,0,"Scenario-based evaluation for usability testing, complemented with data from online questionnaires and field notes of users' performance, was designed and utilized for the evaluation of these solutions."
4347,1,"A comprehensive evaluation methodology framework was developed and applied to four case studies, which were conducted in four different countries (ie, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania), with a total of 126 participants. "
4348,1,"In these case studies, scenarios referring to creating, sharing, and retrieving medical educational content using mEducator3.0 were used. "
4349,1,"The data were collected through two online questionnaires, consisting of 36 closed-ended questions and two open-ended questions that referred to mEducator 3.0 and through the use of field notes during scenario-based evaluations."
4350,2,"The main findings of the study showed that even though the informational needs of the mEducator target groups were addressed to a satisfactory extent and the metadata schema supported content creation, sharing, and retrieval from an end-user perspective, users faced difficulties in achieving a shared understanding of the meaning of some metadata fields and in correctly managing the intellectual property rights of repurposed content."
4351,3,"The results of this evaluation impact researchers, medical professionals, and designers interested in using similar systems for educational content sharing in medical and other domains. "
4352,3,"Recommendations on how to improve the search, retrieval, identification, and obtaining of medical resources are provided, by addressing issues of content description metadata, content description procedures, and intellectual property rights for re-purposed content."
4353,4,Twitter Social Media is an Effective Tool for Breast Cancer Patient Education and Support: Patient-Reported Outcomes by Survey
4354,0,"Despite reported benefits, many women do not attend breast cancer support groups. "
4355,0,"Abundant online resources for support exist, but information regarding the effectiveness of participation is lacking. "
4356,0,We report the results of a Twitter breast cancer support community participant survey.
4357,1,The Breast Cancer Social Media Twitter support community (#BCSM) began in July 2011. 
4358,1,Institutional review board approval with a waiver of informed consent was obtained for a deidentified survey that was posted for 2 weeks on Twitter and on the #BCSM blog and Facebook page.
4359,2,There were 206 respondents to the survey. 
4360,2,"In all, 92.7% (191/206) were female. "
4361,2,"Respondents reported increased knowledge about breast cancer in the following domains: overall knowledge (80.9%, 153/189), survivorship (85.7%, 162/189), metastatic breast cancer (79.4%, 150/189), cancer types and biology (70.9%, 134/189), clinical trials and research (66.1%, 125/189), treatment options (55.6%, 105/189), breast imaging (56.6%, 107/189), genetic testing and risk assessment (53.9%, 102/189), and radiotherapy (43.4%, 82/189). "
4362,2,Participation led 31.2% (59/189) to seek a second opinion or bring additional information to the attention of their treatment team and 71.9% (136/189) reported plans to increase their outreach and advocacy efforts as a result of participation. 
4363,2,"Levels of reported anxiety before and after participation were analyzed: 29 of 43 (67%) patients who initially reported ""high or extreme"" anxiety reported ""low or no"" anxiety after participation (P<.001). "
4364,2,"Also, no patients initially reporting low or no anxiety before participation reported an increase to high or extreme anxiety after participation."
4365,3,This study demonstrates that breast cancer patients' perceived knowledge increases and their anxiety decreases by participation in a Twitter social media support group.
4366,4,"eHealth, Participatory Medicine, and Ethical Care: A Focus Group Study of Patients and Health Care Providers Use of Health-Related Internet Information"
4367,0,"The rapid explosion in online digital health resources is seen as transformational, accelerating the shift from traditionally passive patients to patients as partners and altering the patient-health care professional (HCP) relationship. "
4368,0,"Patients with chronic conditions are increasingly engaged, enabled, and empowered to be partners in their care and encouraged to take responsibility for managing their conditions with HCP support."
4369,1,"We purposively sampled patients and HCPs in British Columbia, Canada, to participate in focus groups. "
4370,1,"To be eligible, patients self-reported a diagnosis of arthritis and at least one other chronic health condition; HCPs reported a caseload with >25% of patients with arthritis and multimorbidity. "
4371,1,"We used a semistructured, but flexible, discussion guide. "
4372,1,All discussions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. 
4373,1,Elements of grounded theory guided our constant comparison thematic analytic approach. 
4374,1,Analysis was iterative. 
4375,1,A relational ethics conceptual lens was applied to the data.
4376,2,"We recruited 32 participants (18 patients, 14 HCPs). "
4377,2,They attended seven focus groups: four with patients and three with rehabilitation professionals and physicians. 
4378,2,"Predominant themes to emerge were how use of health-related Internet information fostered (1) changing roles, (2) patient-HCP partnerships, and (3) tensions and burdens for patients and HCPs."
4379,3,"Relational aspects such as mutual trust, uncertainty, and vulnerability are illuminated in patient-HCP interactions around health-related Internet information and the negotiated space of clinical encounters. "
4380,3,New roles and associated responsibilities have key ethical dimensions that make clear the changes are fundamental and important to understand in ethical care. 
4381,3,"When faced with tensions and burdens around incorporating health-related Internet information as a resource in clinical encounters, participants described a particular ambivalence illustrating the fundamental changes being negotiated by both patients and HCPs."
4382,4,"Seeking Health Information Online: Association With Young Australian Womens Physical, Mental, and Reproductive Health"
4383,0,Relatively little is known about the extent to which young adults use the Internet as a health information resource and whether there are factors that distinguish between those who do and do not go online for health information.
4384,1,"We used data from 17,069 young women aged 18-23 years who participated in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. "
4385,1,"Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association between sociodemographic, physical, mental, and reproductive health factors associated with searching the Internet for health information."
4386,2,"Overall, 43.54% (7433/17,069) of women used the Internet for health information. "
4387,2,"Women who used the Internet had higher odds of regular urinary or bowel symptoms (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.36-1.54), psychological distress (very high distress: OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.37), self-reported mental health diagnoses (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09-1.23), and menstrual symptoms (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15-1.36) than women who did not use the Internet for health information. "
4388,2,"Internet users were less likely to have had blood pressure checks (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93) and skin cancer checks (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.97) and to have had a live birth (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64-0.86) or pregnancy loss (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98) than non-Internet users."
4389,3,"Women experiencing ""stigmatized"" conditions or symptoms were more likely to search the Internet for health information. "
4390,3,"The Internet may be an acceptable resource that offers ""anonymized"" information or support to young women and this has important implications for health service providers and public health policy."
4391,4,Long-Term Outcomes of a Web-Based Diabetes Prevention Program: 2-Year Results of a Single-Arm Longitudinal Study
4392,0,Digital therapeutics are evidence-based behavioral treatments delivered online that can increase accessibility and effectiveness of health care. 
4393,0,"However, few studies have examined long-term clinical outcomes of digital therapeutics."
4394,1,"A quasi-experimental research design was used, including a single-arm pre- and post-intervention assessment of outcomes. "
4395,1,Participants underwent a 16-week weight loss intervention and an ongoing weight maintenance intervention. 
4396,1,"As part of the program, participants received a wireless scale, which was used to collect body weight data on an ongoing basis. "
4397,1,"Participants also received A1c test kits at baseline, 0.5 year, 1 year, and 2-year time points."
4398,2,Participants previously diagnosed with prediabetes (n=220) were originally enrolled in the pilot study. 
4399,2,"A subset of participants (n=187) met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for starting the program (starters), and a further subset (n=155) met CDC criteria for completing the program (completers) and were both included in analyses. "
4400,2,"Program starters lost an average of 4.7% (SD 0.4) of baseline body weight after 1 year and 4.2% (SD 0.8) after 2 years, and reduced A1c by mean 0.38% (SD 0.07) after 1 year and 0.43% (SD 0.08) after 2 years. "
4401,2,"Program completers lost mean 4.9% (SD 0.5) of baseline body weight after 1 year and 4.3% (SD 0.8) after 2 years, and reduced A1c by 0.40% (SD 0.07) after 1 year and 0.46% (SD 0.08) after 2 years. "
4402,2,"For both groups, neither 2-year weight loss nor A1c results were significantly different from 1-year results."
4403,3,Users of the Prevent program experienced significant reductions in body weight and A1c that are maintained after 2 years. 
4404,3,"Contrary to the expected progression from prediabetes to diabetes over time, average A1c levels continued to show an average regression from within the prediabetic range (5.7%-6.4%) initially to the normal range (<5.7%) after 2 years. "
4405,3,Further investigation is warranted to test digital therapeutics as a scalable solution to address national diabetes and cardiovascular disease prevention efforts.
4406,4,Eliciting and Receiving Online Support: Using Computer-Aided Content Analysis to Examine the Dynamics of Online Social Support
4407,0,"Although many people with serious diseases participate in online support communities, little research has investigated how participants elicit and provide social support on these sites."
4408,1,"Communication among approximately 90,000 registered users of an online cancer support community was analyzed. "
4409,1,"The corpus comprised 1,562,459 messages organized into 68,158 discussion threads. "
4410,1,"Amazon Mechanical Turk workers coded (1) 1000 thread-starting messages on 5 attributes (positive and negative emotional self-disclosure, positive and negative informational self-disclosure, questions) and (2) 1000 replies on emotional and informational support. "
4411,1,Their judgments were used to train machine learning models that automatically estimated the amount of these 7 attributes in the messages. 
4412,1,"Across attributes, the average Pearson correlation between human-based judgments and computer-based judgments was .65."
4413,2,Part 1 used human-coded data to investigate relationships between (1) 4 kinds of self-disclosure and question asking in thread-starting posts and (2) the amount of emotional and informational support in the first reply. 
4414,2,"Self-disclosure about negative emotions (beta=.24, P<.001), negative events (beta=.25, P<.001), and positive events (beta=.10, P=.02) increased emotional support. "
4415,2,"However, asking questions depressed emotional support (beta=-.21, P<.001). "
4416,2,"In contrast, asking questions increased informational support (beta=. "
4417,2,"38, P<.001), whereas positive informational self-disclosure depressed it (beta=-.09, P=.003). "
4418,2,"Self-disclosure led to the perception of emotional needs, which elicited emotional support, whereas asking questions led to the perception of informational needs, which elicited informational support. "
4419,2,Part 2 used machine-coded data to replicate these results. 
4420,2,"Part 3 analyzed the machine-coded data and showed that exposure to more emotional support predicted staying in the group longer 33% (hazard ratio=0.67, P<.001), whereas exposure to more informational support predicted leaving the group sooner (hazard ratio=1.05, P<.001)."
4421,3,"Self-disclosure is effective in eliciting emotional support, whereas question asking is effective in eliciting informational support. "
4422,3,"Moreover, perceptions that people desire particular kinds of support influence the support they receive. "
4423,3,"Finally, the type of support people receive affects the likelihood of their staying in or leaving the group. "
4424,3,These results demonstrate the utility of machine learning methods for investigating the dynamics of social support exchange in online support communities.
4425,4,"Efficacy of a Web-Based, Crowdsourced Peer-To-Peer Cognitive Reappraisal Platform for Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial"
4426,0,"Self-guided, Web-based interventions for depression show promising results but suffer from high attrition and low user engagement. "
4427,0,"Online peer support networks can be highly engaging, but they show mixed results and lack evidence-based content."
4428,1,"Participants aged 18-35 were recruited online and were randomly assigned to the treatment group, ""Panoply"" (n= 84), or an active control group, online expressive writing (n= 82). "
4429,1,Both are fully automated Web-based platforms. 
4430,1,Participants were asked to use their assigned platform for a minimum of 25 minutes per week for 3 weeks. 
4431,1,Both platforms involved posting descriptions of stressful thoughts and situations. 
4432,1,Participants on the Panoply platform additionally received crowdsourced reappraisal support immediately after submitting a post (median response time= 9 minutes). 
4433,1,Panoply participants could also practice reappraising stressful situations submitted by other users. 
4434,1,"Online questionnaires administered at baseline and 3 weeks assessed depression symptoms, reappraisal, and perseverative thinking. "
4435,1,"Engagement was assessed through self-report measures, session data, and activity levels."
4436,2,"The Panoply platform produced significant improvements from pre to post for depression (P=.001), reappraisal (P<. "
4437,2,"001), and perseverative thinking (P<. "
4438,2,001). 
4439,2,The expressive writing platform yielded significant pre to post improvements for depression (P=.02) and perseverative thinking (P<. 
4440,2,"001), but not reappraisal (P=.45). "
4441,2,"The two groups did not diverge significantly at post-test on measures of depression or perseverative thinking, though Panoply users had significantly higher reappraisal scores (P=.02) than expressive writing. "
4442,2,We also found significant group by treatment interactions. 
4443,2,Individuals with elevated depression symptoms showed greater comparative benefit from Panoply for depression (P=.02) and perseverative thinking (P=.008). 
4444,2,Individuals with baseline reappraisal deficits showed greater comparative benefit from Panoply for depression (P=.002) and perseverative thinking (P=.002). 
4445,2,"Changes in reappraisal mediated the effects of Panoply, but not the expressive writing platform, for both outcomes of depression (ab=-1.04, SE 0.58, 95% CI -2.67 to -. "
4446,2,"12) and perseverative thinking (ab=-1.02, SE 0.61, 95% CI -2.88 to -. "
4447,2,20). 
4448,2,"Dropout rates were similar for the two platforms; however, Panoply yielded significantly more usage activity (P<. "
4449,2,001) and significantly greater user experience scores (P<. 
4450,2,001).
4451,3,Panoply engaged its users and was especially helpful for depressed individuals and for those who might ordinarily underutilize reappraisal techniques. 
4452,3,Further investigation is needed to examine the long-term effects of such a platform and whether the benefits generalize to a more diverse population of users.
4453,4,Designing and Evaluating an Interactive Multimedia Web-Based Simulation for Developing Nurses Competencies in Acute Nursing Care: Randomized Controlled Trial
4454,0,Web-based learning is becoming an increasingly important instructional tool in nursing education. 
4455,0,Multimedia advancements offer the potential for creating authentic nursing activities for developing nursing competency in clinical practice.
4456,1,"Authentic nursing activities were developed in a Web-based simulation using a variety of instructional strategies including animation video, multimedia instructional material, virtual patients, and online quizzes. "
4457,1,A randomized controlled study was conducted on 67 registered nurses who were recruited from the general ward units of an acute care tertiary hospital. 
4458,1,"Following a baseline evaluation of all participants' clinical performance in a simulated clinical setting, the experimental group received 3 hours of Web-based simulation and completed a survey to evaluate their perceptions of the program. "
4459,1,All participants were re-tested for their clinical performances using a validated tool.
4460,2,The clinical performance posttest scores of the experimental group improved significantly (P<.001) from the pretest scores after the Web-based simulation. 
4461,2,"In addition, compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly higher clinical performance posttest scores (P<.001) after controlling the pretest scores. "
4462,2,The participants from the experimental group were satisfied with their learning experience and gave positive ratings for the quality of the Web-based simulation. 
4463,2,"Themes emerging from the comments about the most valuable aspects of the Web-based simulation include relevance to practice, instructional strategies, and fostering problem solving."
4464,3,Engaging in authentic nursing activities using interactive multimedia Web-based simulation can enhance nurses' competencies in acute care. 
4465,3,Web-based simulations provide a promising educational tool in institutions where large groups of nurses need to be trained in acute nursing care and accessibility to repetitive training is essential for achieving long-term retention of clinical competency.
4466,4,Effectiveness of Different Web-Based Interventions to Prepare Co-Smokers of Cigarettes and Cannabis for Double Cessation: A Three-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial
4467,0,The relationship between tobacco and cannabis use is strong. 
4468,0,"When co-smokers try to quit only one substance, this relationship often leads to a substitution effect, that is, the increased use of the remaining substance. "
4469,0,"Stopping the use of both substances simultaneously is therefore a reasonable strategy, but co-smokers rarely report feeling ready for simultaneous cessation. "
4470,0,"Thus, the question of how co-smokers can be motivated to attempt a simultaneous cessation has arisen. "
4471,0,"To reach as many co-smokers as possible, we developed brief Web-based interventions aimed at enhancing the readiness to simultaneously quit tobacco and cannabis use."
4472,1,"Within a randomized trial, three brief Web-based and fully automated interventions were compared. "
4473,1,"The first intervention combined the assessment of cigarette dependence and problematic cannabis use with personalized, normative feedback. "
4474,1,The second intervention was based on principles of motivational interviewing. 
4475,1,"As an active psychoeducational control group, the third intervention merely provided information on tobacco, cannabis, and the co-use of the two substances. "
4476,1,The readiness to quit tobacco and cannabis simultaneously was measured before and after the intervention (both online) and 8 weeks later (online or over the phone). 
4477,1,"Secondary outcomes included the frequency of cigarette and cannabis use, as measured at baseline and after 8 weeks."
4478,2,"A total of 2467 website users were assessed for eligibility based on their self-reported tobacco and cannabis co-use, and 325 participants were ultimately randomized and analyzed. "
4479,2,"For the post-intervention assessment, generalized estimating equations revealed a significant increase in the readiness to quit tobacco and cannabis in the total sample (B=.33, 95% CI 0.10-0.56, P=.006). "
4480,2,"However, this effect was not significant for the comparison between baseline and the 8-week follow-up assessment (P=.69). "
4481,2,"Furthermore, no differential effects between the interventions were found, nor were any significant intervention or time effects found on the frequency of tobacco or cannabis use."
4482,3,"In the new field of dual interventions for co-smokers of tobacco and cannabis, Web-based interventions can increase the short-term readiness to quit tobacco and cannabis simultaneously. "
4483,3,The studied personalized techniques were no more effective than was psychoeducation. 
4484,3,"The analyzed brief interventions did not change the secondary outcomes, that is the frequency of tobacco and cannabis use."
4485,1,"A total of 876 chronically ill patients from public primary care were allocated to either an intervention group receiving immediate access to a patient portal that included their medical records, care plan, and secure messaging with a care team, or to a control group receiving usual care. "
4486,1,"Patient Activation Measure (PAM) at baseline and at 6-month follow-up was obtained from 80 patients in the intervention group and 57 patients in the control group; thus, a total of 137 patients were included in the final analysis."
4487,2,"No significant effect of access to patient portal on patient activation was detected in this study (F-1,F-133=1.87, P=.17, eta(2)=0.01). "
4488,2,Patients starting at a lower level of activation demonstrated greater positive change in activation compared to patients starting at higher levels of activation in both the intervention and control groups. 
4489,2,"Further, patients diagnosed with a severe diagnosis during the intervention showed greater positive change in patient activation compared to patients whose last severe diagnosis was made more than 2 years ago. "
4490,2,"The results also suggest that the intervention had greatest effect on patients starting at the highest level of patient activation (difference in change of patient activation=4.82, P=.13), and among patients diagnosed within a year of the intervention (difference in change of patient activation=7.65, P=.12)."
4491,3,"Time since last severe diagnosis and patient activation at baseline may affect changes in patient activation, suggesting that these should be considered in evaluation of activating chronic care interventions and in the specification of possible target groups for these interventions. "
4492,3,This may be relevant in designing services for a heterogeneous group of patients with a distinct medical history and level of activation.
4493,4,eHealth Literacy Interventions for Older Adults: A Systematic Review of the Literature
4494,0,"eHealth resources offer new opportunities for older adults to access health information online, connect with others with shared health interests, and manage their health. "
4495,0,"However, older adults often lack sufficient eHealth literacy to maximize their benefit from these resources."
4496,1,A systematic review of peer-reviewed research articles from 28 databases in 9 fields was carried out in January 2013. 
4497,1,Four rounds of screening of articles in these databases resulted in a final sample of 23 articles.
4498,2,"Findings indicated a significant gap in the literature for eHealth literacy interventions evaluating health outcomes as the outcome of interest, a lack of theory-based interventions, and few studies applied high-quality research design."
4499,3,Our findings emphasize the need for researchers to develop and assess theory-based interventions applying high-quality research design in eHealth literacy interventions targeting the older population.
4500,4,Adherence to Self-Monitoring via Interactive Voice Response Technology in an eHealth Intervention Targeting Weight Gain Prevention Among Black Women: Randomized Controlled Trial
4501,0,eHealth interventions are effective for weight control and have the potential for broad reach. 
4502,0,"Little is known about the use of interactive voice response (IVR) technology for self-monitoring in weight control interventions, particularly among populations disproportionately affected by obesity."
4503,1,The Shape Program was a randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-month eHealth behavioral weight gain prevention intervention to usual care among overweight and obese black women in the primary care setting. 
4504,1,"Intervention participants (n=91) used IVR technology to self-monitor behavior change goals (eg, no sugary drinks, 10,000 steps per day) via weekly IVR calls. "
4505,1,"Weight data were collected in clinic at baseline, 6, and 12 months. "
4506,1,Self-monitoring data was stored in a study database and adherence was operationalized as the percent of weeks with a successful IVR call.
4507,2,"Over 12 months, the average IVR completion rate was 71.6% (SD 28.1) and 52% (47/91) had an IVR completion rate >= 80%. "
4508,2,"At 12 months, IVR call completion was significantly correlated with weight loss (r =-.22; P=.04) and participants with an IVR completion rate >= 80% had significantly greater weight loss compared to those with an IVR completion rate <80% (-1.97 kg, SE 0.67 vs 0.48 kg, SE 0.69; P=.01). "
4509,2,"Similar outcomes were found for change in body mass index (BMI; mean difference -0.94 kg, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.24; P=.009). "
4510,2,"Older, more educated participants were more likely to achieve high IVR call completion. "
4511,2,Participants reported positive attitudes toward IVR self-monitoring.
4512,3,Adherence to IVR self-monitoring was high among socioeconomically disadvantaged black women enrolled in a weight gain prevention intervention. 
4513,3,Higher adherence to IVR self-monitoring was also associated with greater weight change. 
4514,3,IVR is an effective and useful tool to promote self-monitoring and has the potential for widespread use and long-term sustainability.
4515,4,Would You Tell Everyone This? Facebook Conversations as Health Promotion Interventions
4516,0,Health promotion interventions on social networking sites can communicate individually tailored content to a large audience. 
4517,0,"User-generated content helps to maximize engagement, but health promotion websites have had variable success in supporting user engagement."
4518,1,We examined the pattern and content of posts on a Facebook page. 
4519,1,Google analytics was used to describe the number of people using the page and viewing patterns. 
4520,1,"A qualitative, thematic approach was used to analyze content."
4521,2,"During the study period (January 18, 2010, to June 27, 2010), 576 users interacted 888 times with the site through 508 posts and 380 comments with 93% of content generated by users. "
4522,2,"The user-generated conversation continued while new participants were driven to the site by advertising, but interaction with the site ceased rapidly after the advertising stopped. "
4523,2,Conversations covered key issues on chlamydia and chlamydia testing. 
4524,2,"Users endorsed testing, celebrated their negative results, and modified and questioned key messages. "
4525,2,There was variation in user approach to the site from sharing of personal experience and requesting help to joking about sexually transmitted infection. 
4526,2,"The moderator voice was reactive, unengaged, tolerant, simplistic, and was professional in tone. "
4527,2,There was no change in the moderator approach throughout the period studied.
4528,3,Our findings suggest this health promotion site provided a space for single user posts but not a self-sustaining conversation. 
4529,3,"Possible explanations for this include little new content from the moderator, a definition of content too narrow to hold the interest of participants, and limited responsiveness to user needs. "
4530,3,Implications for health promotion practice include the need to consider a life cycle approach to online community development for health promotion and the need for a developing moderator strategy to reflect this. 
4531,3,"This strategy should reflect two facets of moderation for online health promotion interventions: (1) unengaged and professional oversight to provide a safe space for discussion and to maintain information quality, and (2) a more engaged and interactive presence designed to maintain interest that generates new material for discussion and is responsive to user requests."
4532,4,Acceptability of Online Self-Help to People With Depression: Users Views of MoodGYM Versus Informational Websites
4533,0,Little is known about the factors that influence acceptability of and adherence to online psychological interventions. 
4534,0,Evidence is needed to guide further development of promising programs.
4535,1,The qualitative data reported here were collected within an online randomized controlled trial whose participants had diagnosable depression. 
4536,1,"The experimental intervention was a 5-week cCBT program called MoodGYM, and the control condition was five informational websites about mental health. "
4537,1,Data were collected via online questionnaires. 
4538,1,There was no evidence of the superiority of either in terms of treatment outcomes. 
4539,1,"In parallel, using brief rating scales and open-ended questions designed for this purpose, we examined the relative acceptability of each approach over time, including perceptions of cCBT compared to seeing a health care professional."
4540,2,"At least 60% of participants held online therapy to be at least as acceptable as seeing a professional about mental health issues, and they were more likely to retain this opinion over time if they used the interactive program, MoodGYM, rather than informational websites alone. "
4541,2,"Barriers to cCBT use fell into four categories: intrinsic, intrapersonal problems; extrinsic technical problems; generic issues mostly pertaining to perceptions of cCBT; and specific issues about the intervention or control condition. "
4542,2,These indicate strategies for improving engagement.
4543,3,"As first-aid for mild to moderate mental health problems, evidence-based computerized approaches have broad acceptability. "
4544,3,This could be increased by attending to the barriers noted here and by proactively managing users' expectations at individual and organizational levels. 
4545,3,The findings have implications for occupational health providers and others addressing the needs of working-age adults with depression. 
4546,3,They also raise methodological issues for online research.
4547,4,Relative Validity of Micronutrient and Fiber Intake Assessed With Two New Interactive Meal- and Web-Based Food Frequency Questionnaires
4548,0,"The meal-and Web-based food frequency questionnaires, Meal-Q and MiniMeal-Q, were developed for cost-efficient assessment of dietary intake in epidemiological studies."
4549,1,"A total of 163 volunteer men and women aged between 20 and 63 years were recruited from Stockholm County, Sweden. "
4550,1,Assessment of micronutrient and fiber intake with the 174-item Meal-Q was compared to a Web-based 7-day weighed food record (WFR). 
4551,1,Two administered Meal-Q questionnaires were compared for reproducibility. 
4552,1,"The 126-item MiniMeal-Q, developed after the validation study, was evaluated in a simulated validation by using truncated Meal-Q data."
4553,2,"The study population consisted of approximately 80% women (129/163) with a mean age of 33 years (SD 12) who were highly educated (130/163, 80% with >12 years of education) on average. "
4554,2,Cross-classification of quartiles with the WFR placed 69% to 90% in the same/adjacent quartile for Meal-Q and 67% to 89% for MiniMeal-Q. 
4555,2,Bland-Altman plots with the WFR and the questionnaires showed large variances and a trend of increasing underestimation with increasing intakes. 
4556,2,"Deattenuated and energy-adjusted Spearman rank correlations between the questionnaires and the WFR were in the range rho=.25-.69, excluding sodium that was not statistically significant. "
4557,2,Cross-classifications of quartiles of the 2 Meal-Q administrations placed 86% to 97% in the same/adjacent quartile. 
4558,2,Intraclass correlation coefficients for energy-adjusted intakes were in the range of .50-.76.
4559,3,"With the exception of sodium, this validation study demonstrates Meal-Q and MiniMeal-Q to be useful methods for ranking micronutrient and fiber intake in epidemiological studies with Web-based data collection."
4560,4,In the Words of the Medical Tourist: An Analysis of Internet Narratives by Health Travelers to Turkey
4561,0,"Patients regularly travel to the West for advanced medical care, but now the trend is also shifting in the opposite direction. "
4562,0,Many people from Western countries now seek care outside of their country. 
4563,0,This phenomenon has been labeled medical tourism or health travel. 
4564,0,"Information regarding health travelers' actual outcomes, experiences, and perceptions is lacking or insufficient. "
4565,0,"However, advanced Internet technology and apps provide information on medical tourism and are a vehicle for patients to share their experiences. "
4566,0,"Turkey has a large number of internationally accredited hospitals, is a top tourism destination, and is positioning itself to attract international patients."
4567,1,This research uses qualitative data from Internet narratives of medical tourists to Turkey. 
4568,1,Ethical considerations of using Internet narratives were reviewed. 
4569,1,Narratives for analysis were obtained by using the Google search engine and using multiple search terms to obtain publicly posted blogs and discussion board postings of health travelers via purposeful sampling. 
4570,1,"Narratives were included if they were written in English, described travel to Turkey for health care, and were publicly accessible. "
4571,1,"Exclusion criteria included narratives that were on medical tourism facilitator or provider promotional websites, not in English, and did not describe an experience of a medical tourist. "
4572,1,Medical tourists' written words were analyzed in an iterative analytic process using narrative analysis theory principles. 
4573,1,"Three stages of coding (open, axial, and selective) were conducted to identify characteristics and themes using qualitative analysis software."
4574,2,The narrative posts of 36 individuals undergoing 47 procedures who traveled to Turkey for medical care between 2007 and 2012 were analyzed. 
4575,2,"The narratives came from 13 countries, not including the narratives for which patient origin could not be determined. "
4576,2,"Travelers were predominantly from Europe (16/36, 44%) and North America (10/36, 28%). "
4577,2,Factors driving travelers away from their home country (push factors) were cost and lack of treatment options or insufficient insurance coverage in their home country. 
4578,2,"Leading factors attracting patients to destination (pull factors) were lower costs, physician's expertise and responsiveness, and familiarity or interest in Turkey. "
4579,2,"Health travelers to Turkey were generally satisfied with the outcomes of their procedures and care provided by their physicians, many noting intent to return. "
4580,2,"Communication challenges, food, transportation, and gaps in customer service emerged as key areas for improvement."
4581,3,This analysis provides an understanding of the insights of medical tourists through the words of actual health travelers. 
4582,3,This nonintrusive methodology provides candid insights of common themes of health travelers and may be applied to study other patient experiences. 
4583,3,The findings of this research expands the body of knowledge in medical tourism and serves as a platform for further qualitative and quantitative research on health travelers' experiences.
4584,4,The Psychometric Properties of CollaboRATE: A Fast and Frugal Patient-Reported Measure of the Shared Decision-Making Process
4585,0,Patient-centered health care is a central component of current health policy agendas. 
4586,0,Shared decision making (SDM) is considered to be the pinnacle of patient engagement and methods to promote this are becoming commonplace. 
4587,0,"However, the measurement of SDM continues to prove challenging. "
4588,0,"Reviews have highlighted the need for a patient-reported measure of SDM that is practical, valid, and reliable to assist implementation efforts. "
4589,0,"In consultation with patients, we developed CollaboRATE, a 3-item measure of the SDM process."
4590,1,A representative sample of the US population were recruited online and were randomly allocated to view 1 of 6 simulated doctor-patient encounters in January 2013. 
4591,1,"Three dimensions of SDM were manipulated in the encounters: (1) explanation of the health issue, (2) elicitation of patient preferences, and (3) integration of patient preferences. "
4592,1,Participants then completed CollaboRATE (possible scores 0-100) in addition to 2 other patient-reported measures of SDM: the 9-item Shared Decision Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) and the Doctor Facilitation subscale of the Patient's Perceived Involvement in Care Scale (PICS). 
4593,1,A subsample of participants was resurveyed between 7 and 14 days after the initial survey. 
4594,1,"We assessed CollaboRATE's discriminative, concurrent, and divergent validity, intrarater reliability, and sensitivity to change."
4595,2,The final sample consisted of 1341 participants. 
4596,2,"CollaboRATE demonstrated discriminative validity, with a significant increase in CollaboRATE score as the number of core dimensions of SDM increased from zero (mean score: 46.0, 95% CI 42.4-49.6) to 3 (mean score 85.8, 95% CI 83.2-88.4). "
4597,2,"CollaboRATE also demonstrated concurrent validity with other measures of SDM, excellent intrarater reliability, and sensitivity to change; however, divergent validity was not demonstrated."
4598,3,The fast and frugal nature of CollaboRATE lends itself to routine clinical use. 
4599,3,Further assessment of CollaboRATE in real-world settings is required.
4600,4,Online Activity and Participation in Treatment Affects the Perceived Efficacy of Social Health Networks Among Patients With Chronic Illness
4601,0,"The use of online health-related social networks for support, peer-to-peer connections, and obtaining health information has increased dramatically. "
4602,0,"Participation in an online health-related social network can enhance patients' self-efficacy and empowerment, as they are given knowledge and tools to manage their chronic health condition more effectively. "
4603,0,"Thus, we can deduce that patient activation, the extent to which individuals are able to manage their own health care, also increases. "
4604,0,"However, little is known about the effects of participation in online health-related social networks and patient activation on the perceived usefulness of a website across disease groups."
4605,1,"Data were collected from ""Camoni"", the first health-related social network in the Hebrew language. "
4606,1,"It offers medical advice, including blogs, forums, support groups, internal mail, chats, and an opportunity to consult with experts. "
4607,1,"This study focused on the site's five largest and most active communities: diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, spinal injury, and depression/anxiety. "
4608,1,Recruitment was conducted during a three-month period in which a link to the study questionnaire was displayed on the Camoni home page. 
4609,1,Three questionnaires were used: a 13-item measure of perceived usefulness (Cronbach alpha=. 
4610,1,"93) to estimate the extent to which an individual found the website helpful and informative, a 9-item measure of active involvement in the website (Cronbach alpha=.84), and The Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13, Cronbach alpha=.86), which assesses a patient's level of active participation in his or her health care."
4611,2,There were 296 participants. 
4612,2,"Men 30-39 years of age scored higher in active involvement than those 40-49 years (P=.03), 50-64 years (P=.004), or 65+ years (P=.01). "
4613,2,Respondents 20-29 years of age scored higher in perceived usefulness than those 50-64 years (P=.04) and those 65+ years (P=.049). 
4614,2,Those aged 20-29 years scored significantly lower on the PAM-13 scale than those aged 30-39 years (P=.01) and 50-64 years (P=.049). 
4615,2,"Men and women had similar PAM-13 scores (F-9,F-283=0.17, P=.76). "
4616,2,Several variables were significant predictors of perceived usefulness. 
4617,2,Age was a negative predictor; younger age was indicative of higher perceived usefulness. 
4618,2,Active involvement was a positive predictor. 
4619,2,"There was a negative relationship found between PAM-13 scores and perceived usefulness, as taking a less active role in one's own medical care predicted higher perceived website usefulness. "
4620,2,A trend toward higher frequency of website activity was associated with increased perception of usefulness.
4621,3,Online health-related social networks can be particularly helpful to individuals with lower patient activation. 
4622,3,"Our findings add information regarding the social and medical importance of such websites, which are gradually becoming an inseparable part of day-to-day chronic disease management in the community."
4623,4,A Case Study of the New York City 2012-2013 Influenza Season With Daily Geocoded Twitter Data From Temporal and Spatiotemporal Perspectives
4624,0,Twitter has shown some usefulness in predicting influenza cases on a weekly basis in multiple countries and on different geographic scales. 
4625,0,"Recently, Broniatowski and colleagues suggested Twitter's relevance at the city-level for New York City. "
4626,0,"Here, we look to dive deeper into the case of New York City by analyzing daily Twitter data from temporal and spatiotemporal perspectives. "
4627,0,"Also, through manual coding of all tweets, we look to gain qualitative insights that can help direct future automated searches."
4628,1,"From the Twitter Streaming API, 2972 tweets were collected in the New York City region matching the keywords ""flu"", ""influenza"", ""gripe"", and ""high fever"". "
4629,1,The tweets were categorized according to the scheme developed by Lamb et al. 
4630,1,A new fourth category was added as an evaluator guess for the probability of the subject(s) being sick to account for strength of confidence in the validity of the statement. 
4631,1,Temporal correlations were made for tweets against daily ILI-ED visits and daily GSQ volume. 
4632,1,The best models were used for linear regression for forecasting ILI visits. 
4633,1,"A weighted, retrospective Poisson model with SaTScan software (n=1484), and vector map were used for spatiotemporal analysis."
4634,2,"Infection- related tweets (R=.763) correlated better than GSQ time series (R=.683) for the same keywords and had a lower mean average percent error (8.4 vs 11.8) for ILI-ED visit prediction in January, the most volatile month of flu. "
4635,2,"SaTScan identified primary outbreak cluster of high-probability infection tweets with a 2.74 relative risk ratio compared to medium-probability infection tweets at P=.001 in Northern Brooklyn, in a radius that includes Barclay's Center and the Atlantic Avenue Terminal."
4636,3,"While others have looked at weekly regional tweets, this study is the first to stress test Twitter for daily city-level data for New York City. "
4637,3,Extraction of personal testimonies of infection-related tweets suggests Twitter's strength both qualitatively and quantitatively for ILI-ED prediction compared to alternative daily datasets mixed with awareness-based data such as GSQ. 
4638,3,"Additionally, granular Twitter data provide important spatiotemporal insights. "
4639,3,A tweet vector-map may be useful for visualization of city-level spread when local gold standard data are otherwise unavailable.
4640,4,Using Ecological Momentary Assessment to Test the Effectiveness of a Web-Based Brief Alcohol Intervention Over Time Among Heavy-Drinking Students: Randomized Controlled Trial
4641,0,Web-based brief alcohol interventions are effective in reducing alcohol use among students when measured at limited follow-up time points. 
4642,0,"To date, no studies have tested Web-based brief alcohol intervention effectiveness over time by using a large number of measurements."
4643,1,"A purely Web-based, 2-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial applying an ecological momentary assessment approach with 30 weekly measurements was conducted in the Netherlands (2010-2011). "
4644,1,Participants were recruited offline and online. 
4645,1,"A total of 907 participants were randomized into the experimental condition (n= 456) including the single-session and fully automated WDYD intervention, or into the control condition (n= 451) including assessment only. "
4646,1,Weekly alcohol consumption and frequency of binge drinking were the self-assessed outcome measures.
4647,2,"Attrition rates of the 907 participants were 110 (12.1%), 130 (14.3%), and 162 (17.9%) at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up intervals, respectively. "
4648,2,"Latent growth curve analyses according to the intention-to-treat principle revealed that participants in the experimental condition had significantly lower weekly alcohol consumption compared to participants in the control condition that was sustained at 3-month follow-up (intercept=-2.60, P<. "
4649,2,"001; slope= 0.16, P=.08). "
4650,2,"Additional linear regression analyses indicated that this intercept difference resulted from significantly higher levels of alcohol units per week for participants in the control condition compared to those in the experimental condition at 1-month (beta=-2.56, SE 0.74, Cohen's d= 0.20, P=.001), 3-month (beta=-1.76, SE 0.60, Cohen's d= 0.13, P=.003), and 6-month (beta=-1.21, SE 0.58, Cohen's d= 0.09, P=.04) follow-up intervals. "
4651,2,"Latent growth curve analyses further indicated that participants in the experimental condition had a significantly lower frequency of binge drinking compared to participants in the control condition that was sustained at 6-month follow-up (intercept=-0.14, P=.01; slope= 0.004, P=.19). "
4652,2,"This intercept difference resulted from higher levels in this outcome for participants in the control condition relative to participants in the experimental condition at 1-month (beta=-1.15, SE 0.06, Cohen's d= 0.16, P=.01), 3-month (beta=-0.12, SE 0.05, Cohen's d= 0.09, P=.01), and 6-month (beta=-0.09, SE 0.05, Cohen's d= 0.03, P=.045) follow-up intervals."
4653,3,The WDYD intervention was shown to be effective in preventing an increase in weekly alcohol consumption and frequency of binge drinking directly after the intervention. 
4654,3,This effect was sustained 3 and 6 months after the intervention.
4655,4,Initial Design of Culturally Informed Behavioral Intervention Technologies: Developing an mHealth Intervention for Young Sexual Minority Men With Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression
4656,0,"To our knowledge, there is no well-articulated process for the design of culturally informed behavioral intervention technologies."
4657,1,"We integrated instructional design for Internet behavioral intervention technologies with greater detail on information sources that can identify user needs in understudied populations, as well as advances in the understanding of technology-specific behavioral intervention technology dimensions that may need to be culturally tailored."
4658,2,General psychological theory describing how to effect change in the clinical target is first integrated with theory describing potentially malleable factors that help explain the clinical problem within the population. 
4659,2,"Additional information sources are then used to (1) evaluate the theory, (2) identify population-specific factors that may affect users' ability to relate to and benefit from the behavioral intervention technology, and (3) establish specific skills, attitudes, knowledge, etc, required to change malleable factors posited in the theory. "
4660,2,User needs result from synthesis of this information. 
4661,2,"Product requirements are then generated through application of the user needs to specific behavioral intervention technology dimensions (eg, technology platform). "
4662,2,We provide examples of considerations relevant to each stage of this process and how they were applied.
4663,3,This process can guide the initial design of other culturally informed behavioral intervention technologies. 
4664,3,This first attempt to create a systematic design process can spur development of guidelines for design of behavioral intervention technologies aimed to reduce health disparities.
4665,4,A Web-Based Tool to Support Shared Decision Making for People With a Psychotic Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial and Process Evaluation
4666,0,Mental health policy makers encourage the development of electronic decision aids to increase patient participation in medical decision making. 
4667,0,Evidence is needed to determine whether these decision aids are helpful in clinical practice and whether they lead to increased patient involvement and better outcomes.
4668,1,The study was carried out in a Dutch mental health institution. 
4669,1,Patients were recruited from 2 outpatient teams for patients with psychosis (N=250). 
4670,1,Patients in the intervention condition (n=124) were provided an account to access a Web-based information and decision tool aimed to support patients in acquiring an overview of their needs and appropriate treatment options provided by their mental health care organization. 
4671,1,Patients were given the opportunity to use the Web-based tool either on their own (at their home computer or at a computer of the service) or with the support of an assistant. 
4672,1,Patients in the control group received care as usual (n=126). 
4673,1,Half of the patients in the sample were patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis; the other half were patients with a chronic psychosis. 
4674,1,"Primary outcome was patient-perceived involvement in medical decision making, measured with the Combined Outcome Measure for Risk Communication and Treatment Decision-making Effectiveness (COMRADE). "
4675,1,"Process evaluation consisted of questionnaire-based surveys, open interviews, and researcher observation."
4676,2,"In all, 73 patients completed the follow-up measurement and were included in the final analysis (response rate 29.2%). "
4677,2,"More than one-third (48/124, 38.7%) of the patients who were provided access to the Web-based decision aid used it, and most used its full functionality. "
4678,2,"No differences were found between the intervention and control conditions on perceived involvement in medical decision making (COMRADE satisfaction with communication: F1,68=0.422, P=.52; COMRADE confidence in decision: F1,67=0.086, P=.77). "
4679,2,"In addition, results of the process evaluation suggest that the intervention did not optimally fit in with routine practice of the participating teams."
4680,3,The development of electronic decision aids to facilitate shared medical decision making is encouraged and many people with a psychotic disorder can work with them. 
4681,3,"This holds for both first-episode patients and long-term care patients, although the latter group might need more assistance. "
4682,3,"However, results of this paper could not support the assumption that the use of electronic decision aids increases patient involvement in medical decision making. "
4683,3,This may be because of weak implementation of the study protocol and a low response rate.
4684,4,"Chinese My Trauma Recovery, A Web-Based Intervention for Traumatized Persons in Two Parallel Samples: Randomized Controlled Trial"
4685,0,Guided self-help interventions for PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) are a promising tool for the dissemination of contemporary psychological treatment.
4686,1,"In an urban context, 90 survivors of different trauma types were recruited via Internet advertisements and allocated to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a waiting list control condition. "
4687,1,"In addition, in a rural context, 93 survivors mainly of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake were recruited in-person for a parallel RCT in which the website intervention was conducted in a counseling center and guided by volunteers. "
4688,1,Assessment was completed online on a professional Chinese survey website. 
4689,1,"The primary outcome measure was the Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS); secondary outcome measures were Symptom Checklist 90-Depression (SCL-D), Trauma Coping Self-Efficacy Scale (CSE), Post-traumatic Cognitive Changes (PCC), and Social Functioning Impairment (SFI) questionnaires adopted from the My Trauma Recovery website."
4690,2,"For the urban sample, findings indicated a significant groupxtime interaction in post-traumatic symptom severity (F-1,F-88=7.65, P=.007). "
4691,2,"CMTR reduced post-traumatic symptoms significantly with high effect size after one month of treatment (F-1,F-45=15.13, Cohen's d=0.81, P<.001) and the reduction was sustained over a 3-month follow-up (F-1,F-45=17.29, Cohen's d=0.87, P<.001). "
4692,2,"In the rural sample, the groupxtime interaction was also significant in post-traumatic symptom severity (F-1,F-91=5.35, P=.02). "
4693,2,"Post-traumatic symptoms decreased significantly after treatment (F-1,F-48=43.97, Cohen's d=1.34, P<.001) and during the follow-up period (F-1,F-48=24.22, Cohen's d=0.99, P<.001). "
4694,2,"Additional outcome measures (post-traumatic cognitive changes, depression) indicated a range of positive effects, in particular in the urban sample (groupxtime interactions: F-1,F-88=5.32-8.37, all Ps<.03), contributing to the positive evidence for self-help interventions. "
4695,2,"Differences in the effects in the two RCTs are exploratorily explained by sociodemographic, motivational, and setting feature differences between the two samples."
4696,3,These findings give support for the short-term efficacy of CMTR in the two Chinese populations and contribute to the literature that self-help Web-based programs can be used to provide mental health help for traumatized persons.
4697,4,Silence is Golden: Effect of Encouragement in Motivating the Weak Link in an Online Exercise Video Game
4698,0,"Despite the physical and mental health benefits, few adults meet US Department of Health and Human Services physical activity guidelines for exercise frequency, intensity, and duration. "
4699,0,"One strategy that may increase physical activity duration is exercising with an Internet partner (ie, someone who is virtually present, as in video chat). "
4700,0,"Internet partners help people overcome many barriers associated with face-to-face exercise groups (eg, time, coordinating schedules, social physique anxiety). "
4701,0,"Past research examining individual performance in groups suggests that an increase in effort occurs when performing a task conjunctively, ie, when a participant is (1) less capable than fellow group members, and (2) participants efforts are particularly indispensable for group success (ie, where the group's potential productivity is equal to the productivity of its least capable member). "
4702,0,"This boost in effort is more commonly known as the Kohler effect, named after the German psychologist who first observed the effect. "
4703,0,"While encouragement between group members is common practice in face-to-face group exercise, the effect of encouragement between partners exercising conjunctively across the Internet is unknown."
4704,1,Participants were recruited online and face-to-face from the campus of Michigan State University. 
4705,1,"With the assistance of the experimenter, participants (n=115) played an exercise video game in a laboratory, performing a series of five abdominal plank exercises where they were asked to hold the plank for as long as possible (Time 1). "
4706,1,"They were then randomized to a condition (Individual, Partner-without-encouragement, or Partner-with-encouragement), where they performed the exercises again (Time 2). "
4707,1,The impact of condition on the primary outcome measures and secondary outcome measures were evaluated using a 2 (Gender) x 3 (Condition) ANOVA on change scores (Time 2-Time 1).
4708,2,"Those who exercised in online teams (n=80) exercised significantly longer (time=78.8s, P<.001) than those who worked individually (n=35). "
4709,2,"However, exercise duration was shorter when one's more capable partner gave verbal encouragement (n=55) than when s/he did not (n=25) (a mean difference of 31.14s). "
4710,2,"These increases in effort were not accompanied by altered task self-efficacy, enjoyment of the task, or intention to exercise in the future."
4711,3,Exercising conjunctively with an Internet partner can boost one's duration of exercise. 
4712,3,"However, encouragement from the stronger to the weaker member can mitigate these gains, especially if one perceives such comments being directed at someone other than themselves. "
4713,3,"To boost exercise duration, Internet-based physical activity interventions involving group interaction should make relative abilities of participants known and communication clear."
4714,4,Crowdsourcing Participatory Evaluation of Medical Pictograms Using Amazon Mechanical Turk
4715,0,"Consumer and patient participation proved to be an effective approach for medical pictogram design, but it can be costly and time-consuming. "
4716,0,"We proposed and evaluated an inexpensive approach that crowdsourced the pictogram evaluation task to Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers, who are usually referred to as the ""turkers""."
4717,1,We designed a Web-based survey (open-ended tests) to ask 100 US turkers to type in their guesses of the meaning of 20 US pharmacopeial pictograms. 
4718,1,"Two judges independently coded the turkers' guesses into four categories: correct, partially correct, wrong, and completely wrong. "
4719,1,"The comprehensibility of a pictogram was measured by the percentage of correct guesses, with each partially correct guess counted as 0.5 correct. "
4720,1,We then conducted a content analysis on the turkers' interpretations to identify misunderstandings and assess whether the misunderstandings were common. 
4721,1,We also conducted a statistical analysis to examine the relationship between turkers' demographic characteristics and their pictogram comprehension performance.
4722,2,"The survey was completed within 3 days of our posting the task to the MTurk, and the collected data are publicly available in the multimedia appendix for download. "
4723,2,"The comprehensibility for the 20 tested pictograms ranged from 45% to 98%, with an average of 72.5%. "
4724,2,The comprehensibility scores of 10 pictograms were strongly correlated to the scores of the same pictograms reported in another study that used oral response-based open-ended testing with local people. 
4725,2,The turkers' misinterpretations shared common errors that exposed design problems in the pictograms. 
4726,2,Participant performance was positively correlated with their educational level.
4727,3,The results confirmed that crowdsourcing can be used as an effective and inexpensive approach for participatory evaluation of medical pictograms. 
4728,3,"Through Web-based open-ended testing, the crowd can effectively identify problems in pictogram designs. "
4729,3,The results also confirmed that education has a significant effect on the comprehension of medical pictograms. 
4730,3,"Since low-literate people are underrepresented in the turker population, further investigation is needed to examine to what extent turkers' misunderstandings overlap with those elicited from low-literate people."
4731,4,Hispanic Migrant Farm Workers Attitudes Toward Mobile Phone-Based Telehealth for Management of Chronic Health Conditions
4732,0,Mobile phone-based interventions present a means of providing high quality health care to hard-to-reach underserved populations. 
4733,0,Migrant farm workers (MFWs) are among the most underserved populations in the United States due to a high prevalence of chronic diseases yet limited access to health care. 
4734,0,"However, it is unknown if MFWs have access to mobile phone devices used in mobile health (mHealth) interventions, or if they are willing to use such technologies."
4735,1,A demonstration of mHealth devices and a survey were individually administered to 80 Hispanic MFWs to evaluate use of mobile phones and mHealth devices and willingness to use such technologies.
4736,2,"Of the 80 participants, 81% (65/80) owned cell phones capable of sending and receiving health-related messages. "
4737,2,"Most participants (65/80, 81%) were receptive to using mHealth technology and felt it would be helpful in enhancing medication adherence, self-monitoring health conditions, and receiving quicker medication changes from their doctors (median scores >= 4 on 5-point Likert scales). "
4738,2,Relations between age and attitudes toward using mHealth were not statistically significant.
4739,3,Hispanic MFWs have access to mobile phones and are willing to use mHealth devices. 
4740,3,Future work is needed to comprehensively evaluate the degree to which these devices could be used.
4741,4,How User Characteristics Affect Use Patterns in Web-Based Illness Management Support for Patients with Breast and Prostate Cancer
4742,0,"Frequently eHealth applications are not used as intended and they have high attrition rates; therefore, a better understanding of patients'need for support is warranted. "
4743,0,"Specifically, more research is needed to identify which system components target different patient groups and under what conditions."
4744,1,"For this secondary post hoc analysis of a large randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which WebChoice was tested among 325 breast cancer and prostate cancer patients who were followed with repeated measures for 1 year, usage patterns of 162 cancer patients in the intervention arm with access to WebChoice were extracted from the user log. "
4745,1,Logistic regression was performed to identify patterns of associations between system use and patient characteristics. 
4746,1,"Latent class analyses (LCA) were performed to identify associations among the use of different system components and levels of social support, symptom distress, depression, self-efficacy, and health-related quality of life."
4747,2,"Approximately two-thirds (103/162, 63.6%) of the patients logged on to WebChoice more than once, and were defined as users. "
4748,2,"A high level of computer experience (odds ratio [OR] 3.77, 95% CI 1.20-11.91) and not having other illnesses in addition to cancer (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.02-4.34) increased the overall probability of using WebChoice. "
4749,2,LCA showed that both men with prostate cancer and women with breast cancer who had low scores on social support accompanied with high levels of symptom distress and high levels of depression were more likely to use the e-message component. 
4750,2,"For men with prostate cancer, these variables were also associated with high use of the self-management advice component. "
4751,2,We found important differences between men with prostate cancer and women with breast cancer when associations between WebChoice use and each user characteristic were analyzed separately. 
4752,2,"High use of all components was associated with low levels of social support among women with breast cancer, but not among men with prostate cancer. "
4753,2,"High use of e-messages, advice, and the discussion forum were associated with high levels of depression among women with breast cancer, but not among men with prostate cancer. "
4754,2,"For men with prostate cancer (but not women with breast cancer), high use of symptom assessments, advice, and the discussion forum were associated with high levels of symptom distress. "
4755,2,"However, it is unclear whether these findings can be attributed to differences related to diagnosis, gender, or both."
4756,3,This study provides evidence that different user characteristics are associated with different use patterns. 
4757,3,Such information is crucial to target Web-based support systems to different patient groups. 
4758,3,LCA is a useful technique to identify subgroups of users. 
4759,3,"In our study, e-messages and self-management advice were highly used components for patients who had low levels of social support and high illness burden, suggesting that patients with these characteristics may find such tools particularly useful."
4760,1,"A total of 368 sedentary men and women (M=60.3; SD 4.9) were recruited, screened, and assessed online. "
4761,1,"They were randomized into treatment and control groups and assessed at pretest, at 12 weeks, and at 6 months. "
4762,1,"After treatment group participants rated their fitness level, activity goals, and barriers to exercise, the Internet intervention program helped them select exercise activities in the areas of endurance, flexibility, strengthening, and balance enhancement. "
4763,1,"They returned to the program weekly for automated video and text support and education, with the option to change or increase their exercise plan. "
4764,1,The program also included ongoing problem solving to overcome user-identified barriers to exercise.
4765,2,The multivariate model indicated significant treatment effects at posttest (P=.001; large effect size) and at 6 months (P=.001; medium effect size). 
4766,2,"At posttest, intervention participation showed significant improvement on 13 of 14 outcome measures compared to the control participants. "
4767,2,"At 6 months, treatment participants maintained large gains compared to the control participants on all 14 outcome measures."
4768,3,These results suggest that an online PA program has the potential to positively impact the physical activity of sedentary older adult participants. 
4769,3,"More research is needed to replicate the study results, which were based on self-report measures. "
4770,3,Research is also needed on intervention effects with older populations. 
4771,4,Evaluating the Translation Process of an Internet-Based Self-Help Intervention for Prevention of Depression: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
4772,0,"Depression is common and treatable with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), for example. "
4773,0,"However, access to this therapy is limited. "
4774,0,Internet-based interventions have been found to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression. 
4775,0,The International Society for Research on Internet Interventions has highlighted the importance of translating effective Internet programs into multiple languages to enable worldwide dissemination.
4776,1,This paper reports an evaluation of a trial in which a research group in Norway translated two English-language Internet-based interventions into Norwegian (MoodGYM and BluePages) that had previously been shown to reduce symptoms of depression. 
4777,1,The translation process and estimates of the cost-effectiveness of such a translation process is described. 
4778,1,Estimated health effect was found by using quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
4779,2,"Conservative estimates indicate that for every 1000 persons treated, 16 QALYs are gained. "
4780,2,The investment is returned 9 times and the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) is 3432. 
4781,2,The costs of the translation project totaled to approximately 27% of the estimated original English-language version development costs.
4782,3,The economic analysis shows that the cost-effectiveness of the translation project was substantial. 
4783,3,"Hopefully, these results will encourage others to do similar analyses and report cost-effectiveness data in their research reports. "
4784,1,The study consisted of a telephone survey of 1745 adults who reported going online to look for health-related information. 
4785,1,"Four subscales were created to measure use of online resources for (1) using SNS for health-related activities; (2) consulting online rankings and reviews of doctors, hospitals or medical facilities, and drugs or medical treatments; (3) posting a review online of doctors, hospitals or medical facilities, and drugs or medical treatments, and (4) posting a comment or question about health or medical issues on various social media. "
4786,1,Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.
4787,2,"Respondents consulted online rankings or reviews (41.15%), used SNS for health (31.58%), posted reviews (9.91%), and posted a comment, question, or information (15.19%). "
4788,2,"Respondents with a chronic disease were nearly twice as likely to consult online rankings (odds ratio [OR] 2.09, 95% CI 1.66-2.63, P<.001). "
4789,2,"Lower odds of consulting online reviews were associated with less formal education (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37-0.65, P<.001) and being male (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.87, P<.001). "
4790,2,"Respondents with higher incomes were 1.5 times as likely to consult online rankings or reviews (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.10-2.24, P=.05), than respondents with a regular provider (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.52-2.78, P<.001), or living in an urban/suburban location (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.17-2.22, P<.001). "
4791,2,"Older respondents were less likely to use SNS for health-related activities (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95-0.97, P<.001), as were males (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56-0.87, P<.001), whereas respondents with a regular provider had nearly twice the likelihood of using SNS for health-related activities (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.43-2.52, P<.001)."
4792,3,People are using social media for seeking health information. 
4793,3,"However, individuals are more likely to consume information than they are to contribute to the dialog. "
4794,3,"The inherent value of ""social"" in social media is not being captured with online health information seeking. "
4795,3,"People with a regular health care provider, chronic disease, and those in younger age groups are more likely to consult online rankings and reviews and use SNS for health-related activities. "
4796,4,eHealth Program to Empower Patients in Returning to Normal Activities and Work After Gynecological Surgery: Intervention Mapping as a Useful Method for Development
4797,0,Full recovery after gynecological surgery takes much longer than expected regardless of surgical technique or the level of invasiveness. 
4798,0,"After discharge, detailed convalescence recommendations are not provided to patients typically, and postoperative care is fragmented, poorly coordinated, and given only on demand. "
4799,0,"For patients, this contributes to irrational beliefs and avoidance of resumption of activities and can result in a prolonged sick leave."
4800,1,The intervention mapping (IM) protocol was used to develop the eHealth intervention. 
4801,1,A literature search about behavioral and environmental conditions of prolonged sick leave and delayed RTW in patients was performed. 
4802,1,"Patients' needs, attitudes, and beliefs regarding postoperative recovery and resumption of work were identified through focus group discussions. "
4803,1,"Additionally, a literature search was performed to obtain determinants, methods, and strategies for the development of a suitable interactive eHealth intervention to empower patients to return to normal activities after gynecological surgery, including work. "
4804,1,"Finally, the eHealth intervention was evaluated by focus group participants, medical doctors, and eHealth specialists through questionnaires."
4805,2,Twenty-one patients participated in the focus group discussions. 
4806,2,"Sufficient, uniform, and tailored information regarding surgical procedures, complications, and resumption of activities and work were considered most essential. "
4807,2,"Knowing who to contact in case of mental or physical complaints, and counseling and tools for work reintegration were also considered important. "
4808,2,"Finally, opportunities to exchange experiences with other patients were a major issue. "
4809,2,"Considering the determinants of the Attitude-Social influence-self-Efficacy (ASE) model, various strategies based on a combination of theory and evidence were used, resulting in an eHealth intervention with different interactive functionalities including tailored convalescence recommendations and a video to communicate the most common pitfalls during the perioperative period to patients and employers. "
4810,2,"Fifteen patients in the focus groups, 11 physicians, and 3 eHealth specialists suggested points for improvement to optimize the usability of the eHealth intervention and judged it an approachable, appropriate, and attractive eHealth intervention to empower gynecological patients."
4811,3,The IM protocol was a useful method to develop an eHealth intervention based on both theory and evidence. 
4812,3,All patients and stakeholders judged the eHealth intervention to be a promising tool to empower gynecological patients during the perioperative period and to help them to return to normal activities and work. 
4813,4,Munchausen by Internet: Current Research and Future Directions
4814,0,"The Internet has revolutionized the health world, enabling self-diagnosis and online support to take place irrespective of time or location. "
4815,0,"Alongside the positive aspects for an individual's health from making use of the Internet, debate has intensified on how the increasing use of Web technology might have a negative impact on patients, caregivers, and practitioners. "
4816,0,One such negative health-related behavior is Munchausen by Internet.
4817,1,A wide-ranging review was conducted to investigate the causes and impacts of online identity deception and Munchausen by Internet drawing on academic research and case studies reported online and in the media.
4818,2,"The limited research relating to motivation, opportunity, detection, effects, and consequences of Munchausen by Internet is highlighted and it is formally linked to aspects of trolling. "
4819,2,Case studies are used to illustrate the phenomenon. 
4820,2,"What is particularly worrying is the ease with which the deception can be carried out online, the difficulty in detection, and the damaging impact and potential danger to isolated victims."
4821,3,We suggest ways to deal with Munchausen by Internet and provide advice for health group facilitators. 
4822,3,We also propose that Munchausen by Internet and Munchausen by Internet trolling should be formally acknowledged in a revised version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-5. 
4823,3,This will assist in effectively identifying and minimizing the growth of this behavior as more people seek reassurance and support about their health in the online environment. 
4824,3,We also suggest directions for future research.
4825,4,Animated Graphics for Comparing Two Risks: A Cautionary Tale
4826,0,The increasing use of computer-administered risk communications affords the potential to replace static risk graphics with animations that use motion cues to reinforce key risk messages. 
4827,0,"Research on the use of animated graphics, however, has yielded mixed findings, and little research exists to identify the specific animations that might improve risk knowledge and patients' decision making."
4828,1,A total of 4198 members of a demographically diverse Internet panel read a scenario about two hypothetical treatments for thyroid cancer. 
4829,1,Each treatment was described as equally effective but varied in side effects (with one option slightly better than the other). 
4830,1,Participants were randomly assigned to receive all risk information in 1 of 10 pictograph formats in a quasi-factorial design. 
4831,1,"We compared a control condition of static grouped icons with a static scattered icon display and with 8 Flash-based animated versions that incorporated different combinations of (1) building the risk 1 icon at a time, (2) having scattered risk icons settle into a group, or (3) having scattered risk icons shuffle themselves (either automatically or by user control). "
4832,1,"We assessed participants' ability to choose the better treatment (choice accuracy), their gist knowledge of side effects (knowledge accuracy), and their graph evaluation ratings, controlling for subjective numeracy and need for cognition."
4833,2,"When compared against static grouped-icon arrays, no animations significantly improved any outcomes, and most showed significant performance degradations. "
4834,2,"However, participants who received animations of grouped icons in which at-risk icons appeared 1 at a time performed as well on all outcomes as the static grouped-icon control group. "
4835,2,Displays with scattered icons (static or animated) performed particularly poorly unless they included the settle animation that allowed users to view event icons grouped.
4836,3,"Many combinations of animation, especially those with scattered icons that shuffle randomly, appear to inhibit knowledge accuracy in this context. "
4837,3,"Static pictographs that group risk icons, however, perform very well on measures of knowledge and choice accuracy. "
4838,3,"These findings parallel recent evidence in other data communication contexts that less can be more-that is, that simpler, more focused information presentation can result in improved understanding. "
4839,3,"Decision aid designers and health educators should proceed with caution when considering the use of animated risk graphics to compare two risks, given that evidence-based, static risk graphics appear optimal."
4840,4,Using Crowdsourcing Technology for Testing Multilingual Public Health Promotion Materials
4841,0,Effective communication of public health messages is a key strategy for health promotion by public health agencies. 
4842,0,Creating effective health promotion materials requires careful message design and feedback from representatives of target populations. 
4843,0,This is particularly true when the target audiences are hard to reach as limited English proficiency groups. 
4844,0,Traditional methods of soliciting feedback-such as focus groups and convenience sample interviews-are expensive and time consuming. 
4845,0,"As a result, adequate feedback from target populations is often insufficient due to the time and resource constraints characteristic to public health."
4846,1,We developed health promotion materials on pediatric dental health issues in four different formats and in two languages (English and Spanish). 
4847,1,We then designed an online survey to elicit feedback on format preferences and made it available in both languages via the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform.
4848,2,"We surveyed 236 native English-speaking and 163 native Spanish-speaking participants in less than 12 days, at a cost of US $374. "
4849,2,"Overall, Spanish-speaking participants originated from a wider distribution of countries than the overall Latino population in the United States. "
4850,2,Most participants were in the 18- to 29-year age range and had some college or graduate education. 
4851,2,Participants provided valuable input for the health promotion material design.
4852,3,Our results indicate that crowdsourcing can be an effective method for recruiting and gaining feedback from English-speaking and Spanish-speaking people. 
4853,3,"Compared with traditional methods, crowdsourcing has the potential to reach more diverse populations than convenience sampling, while substantially reducing the time and cost of gathering participant feedback. "
4854,3,More widespread adoption of this method could streamline the development of effective health promotion materials in multiple languages.
4855,4,Internet-Based Computer Tailored Feedback on Sunscreen Use
4856,0,Skin cancer incidence rates signify the need for effective programs for the prevention of skin cancer and for helping skin cancer patients. 
4857,0,Internet and computer tailored (CT) technology fosters the development of highly individualized health communication messages. 
4858,0,"Yet, reactions to Internet CT programs may differ per level of involvement and education level and remain understudied."
4859,1,A cross-sectional research design was used. 
4860,1,"In total, 387 respondents participated and filled out an online questionnaire based on the I-Change Model assessing socio-demographics, history of skin cancer, sunscreen use, and beliefs about sunscreen use. "
4861,1,The responses were fed into a computer program that generated personal tailored feedback on screen; next we assessed their program evaluations
4862,2,"Of the 132 patients, 92 were female (69.7%) and 40 were male (30.3%). "
4863,2,"In the general population (N = 225), 139 (54.5%) respondents were female and 116 (45.5%) were male. "
4864,2,Men (50.9 years) were 8 years older than women (43.1 years). 
4865,2,"Most patients were diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma (N = 65; 49.2%), followed by melanoma (N = 28; 21.2%) and squamous cell carcinoma (N = 10; 7.6%); 22% (N = 29) did not remember their skin cancer type. "
4866,2,"Patients had higher knowledge levels, felt significantly more at risk, were more convinced of the pros of sunscreen, experienced more social support to use sunscreen, had higher self-efficacy, and made more plans to use sunscreen than respondents without skin cancer (N = 255; all P's<.01). "
4867,2,Low (N=196) educated respondents scored lower on knowledge (P<.003) but made more action plans (P<.03) than higher educated respondents (N=191). 
4868,2,"The CT feedback was evaluated positively by all respondents, and scored a 7.8 on a 10 point scale. "
4869,2,"Yet, patients evaluated the CT program slightly more (P<.05) positive (8.1) than non-patients. "
4870,2,(7.6). 
4871,2,Lower educated respondents were significantly (P<.05) more positive about the advantages of the program.
4872,3,"First, involvement with skin cancer was reflected in more positive beliefs toward sunscreen use in patients in comparison with non-patients. "
4873,3,"Second, the CT Internet program was well accepted by both patients and non-patients, and low and high educated respondents, perhaps because higher educated respondents were more knowledgeable about sunscreen use and skin cancer. "
4874,3,"Third, a pro-active approach as conducted in our study is very well suited to reach various groups of people and is more likely to be successful than a reactive approach"
4875,4,Primary Care Providers Perspectives on Online Weight-Loss Programs: A Big Wish List
4876,0,Integrating online weight-loss programs into the primary care setting could yield substantial public health benefit. 
4877,0,Little is known about primary care providers' perspectives on online weight-loss programs.
4878,1,"We conducted focus group discussions with providers in family medicine, internal medicine, and combined internal medicine/pediatrics in Texas and Pennsylvania, USA. "
4879,1,Open-ended questions addressed their experience with and attitudes toward online weight-loss programs; useful characteristics of existing online weight-loss programs; barriers to referring patients to online weight-loss programs; and preferred characteristics of an ideal online weight-loss program. 
4880,1,Transcripts were analyzed with the grounded theory approach to identify major themes.
4881,2,A total of 44 primary care providers participated in 9 focus groups. 
4882,2,The mean age was 45 (SD 9) years. 
4883,2,Providers had limited experience with structured online weight-loss programs and were uncertain about their safety and efficacy. 
4884,2,"They thought motivated, younger patients would be more likely than others to respond to an online weight-loss program. "
4885,2,"According to primary care providers, an ideal online weight-loss program would provide-at no cost to the patient-a structured curriculum addressing motivation, psychological issues, and problem solving; tools for tracking diet, exercise, and weight loss; and peer support monitored by experts. "
4886,2,"Primary care providers were interested in receiving reports about patients from the online weight-loss programs, but were concerned about the time required to review and act on the reports."
4887,3,Primary care providers have high expectations for how online weight-loss programs should deliver services to patients and fit into the clinical workflow. 
4888,3,Efforts to integrate online weight-loss programs into the primary care setting should address efficacy and safety of online weight-loss programs in clinic-based populations; acceptable methods of sending reports to primary care providers about their patients' progress; and elimination or reduction of costs to patients.
4889,4,With Some Help From My Network: Supplementing eHealth Literacy With Social Ties
4890,0,eHealth literacy is defined as the ability of people to use emerging information and communications technologies to improve or enable health and health care.
4891,1,"We used a countrywide representative random-digital-dial telephone household survey of the Israeli adult population (18 years and older, N = 4286). "
4892,1,"We measured eHealth literacy; Internet access; digital literacy; sociodemographic factors; perceived health; presence of chronic diseases; as well as health information sources, content, search strategies, and evaluation criteria used by consumers."
4893,2,Respondents who were highly eHealth literate tended to be younger and more educated than their less eHealth-literate counterparts. 
4894,2,"They were also more active consumers of all types of information on the Internet, used more search strategies, and scrutinized information more carefully than did the less eHealth-literate respondents. "
4895,2,"Finally, respondents who were highly eHealth literate gained more positive outcomes from the information search in terms of cognitive, instrumental (self-management of health care needs, health behaviors, and better use of health insurance), and interpersonal (interacting with their physician) gains."
4896,3,"The present study documented differences between respondents high and low in eHealth literacy in terms of background attributes, information consumption, and outcomes of the information search. "
4897,3,The association of eHealth literacy with background attributes indicates that the Internet reinforces existing social differences. 
4898,3,The more comprehensive and sophisticated use of the Internet and the subsequent increased gains among the high eHealth literate create new inequalities in the domain of digital health information. 
4899,3,"There is a need to educate at-risk and needy groups (eg, chronically ill) and to design technology in a mode befitting more consumers."
4900,4,The Impact of Electronic Patient Portals on Patient Care: A Systematic Review of Controlled Trials
4901,0,The emergence of the Internet has triggered tremendous changes in the publication of scientific peer-reviewed journals. 
4902,0,"Today, journals are usually available in parallel electronic versions, but the way the peer-review process works, the look of articles and journals, and the rigid and slow publication schedules have remained largely unchanged, at least for the vast majority of subscription-based journals. "
4903,0,"Those publishing firms and scholarly publishers who have chosen the more radical option of open access (OA), in which the content of journals is freely accessible to anybody with Internet connectivity, have had a much bigger degree of freedom to experiment with innovations."
4904,1,The features of 24 open access journals were studied. 
4905,1,The journals were chosen in a nonrandom manner from the approximately 7000 existing OA journals based on available information about interesting journals and include both representative cases and highly innovative outlier cases.
4906,2,Most early OA journals in the 1990s were founded by individual scholars and used a business model based on voluntary work close in spirit to open-source development of software. 
4907,2,"In the next wave, many long-established journals, in particular society journals and journals from regions such as Latin America, made their articles OA when they started publishing parallel electronic versions. "
4908,2,"From about 2002 on, newly founded professional OA publishing firms using article-processing charges to fund their operations have emerged. "
4909,2,"Over the years, there have been several experiments with new forms of peer review, media enhancements, and the inclusion of structured data sets with articles. "
4910,2,"In recent years, the growth of OA publishing has also been facilitated by the availability of open-source software for journal publishing."
4911,3,The case studies illustrate how a new technology and a business model enabled by new technology can be harnessed to find new innovative ways for the organization and content of scholarly publishing. 
4912,3,Several recent launches of OA journals by major subscription publishers demonstrate that OA is rapidly gaining acceptance as a sustainable alternative to subscription-based scholarly publishing.
4913,4,A Framework for Characterizing eHealth Literacy Demands and Barriers
4914,0,Consumer eHealth interventions are of a growing importance in the individual management of health and health behaviors. 
4915,0,"However, a range of access, resources, and skills barriers prevent health care consumers from fully engaging in and benefiting from the spectrum of eHealth interventions. "
4916,0,"Consumers may engage in a range of eHealth tasks, such as participating in health discussion forums and entering information into a personal health record. "
4917,0,"eHealth literacy names a set of skills and knowledge that are essential for productive interactions with technology-based health tools, such as proficiency in information retrieval strategies, and communicating health concepts effectively."
4918,1,We adapted and integrated two existing theoretical models relevant to the analysis of eHealth literacy into a single framework to systematically categorize and describe task demands and user performance on tasks needed by health care consumers in the information age. 
4919,1,"The method derived from the framework is applied to (1) code task demands using a cognitive task analysis, and (2) code user performance on tasks. "
4920,1,The framework and method are applied to the analysis of a Web-based consumer eHealth task with information-seeking and decision-making demands. 
4921,1,We present the results from the in-depth analysis of the task performance of a single user as well as of 20 users on the same task to illustrate both the detailed analysis and the aggregate measures obtained and potential analyses that can be performed using this method.
4922,2,The analysis shows that the framework can be used to classify task demands as well as the barriers encountered in user performance of the tasks. 
4923,2,"Our approach can be used to (1) characterize the challenges confronted by participants in performing the tasks, (2) determine the extent to which application of the framework to the cognitive task analysis can predict and explain the problems encountered by participants, and (3) inform revisions to the framework to increase accuracy of predictions."
4924,3,The results of this illustrative application suggest that the framework is useful for characterizing task complexity and for diagnosing and explaining barriers encountered in task completion. 
4925,3,"The framework and analytic approach can be a potentially powerful generative research platform to inform development of rigorous eHealth examination and design instruments, such as to assess eHealth competence, to design and evaluate consumer eHealth tools, and to develop an eHealth curriculum."
4926,4,Can Online Consumers Contribute to Drug Knowledge? A Mixed-Methods Comparison of Consumer-Generated and Professionally Controlled Psychotropic Medication Information on the Internet
4927,0,"Ongoing initiatives to filter online health searches exclude consumer-generated content from search returns, though its inferiority compared with professionally controlled content is not demonstrated. "
4928,0,The antidepressant escitalopram and the antipsychotic quetiapine have ranked over the last 5 years as top-selling agents in their respective drug classes. 
4929,0,"Both drugs have various off-label mental health and non-mental health uses, ranging from the relief of insomnia and migraines to the treatment of severe developmental disorders."
4930,1,A stratified simple random sample of 960 consumer reviews was selected from all 6998 consumer reviews of the two drugs in 2 consumer-generated (www.askapatient.com and www.crazymeds.us) and 2 professionally controlled (www.webmd.com and www.revolutionhealth.com) health websites. 
4931,1,Professional medication descriptions included all standard information on the medications from the latter 2 websites. 
4932,1,"All textual data were inductively coded for medication effects, and intercoder agreement was assessed. "
4933,1,Chi-square was used to test for associations between consumer-reported effects and website origination.
4934,0,The Internet has revolutionized the way in which many Americans search for health care information. 
4935,0,"Unfortunately, being able to use the Internet for this purpose is predicated on having access to the Internet and being able to understand and comprehend online health information. "
4936,0,This is especially important for parents of children with special health care needs who are forced to make many medical decisions throughout the lives of their children. 
4937,0,"Yet, no information is available about this vulnerable group."
4938,1,This was a cross-sectional telephone survey of 2371 parents whose children with special health care needs were enrolled in Florida's Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Plan (SCHIP) programs (4072 parents were approached). 
4939,1,"To be enrolled in the program, families must have incomes that are less than or equal to 200% of the federal poverty level. "
4940,1,The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) was used to measure eHealth literacy. 
4941,1,Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted to address the study objectives.
4942,0,"Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), linked to inappropriate medication use and higher health care expenditures, is the fastest growing form of pharmaceutical marketing. "
4943,0,DTCA is legal only in the United States and New Zealand. 
4944,0,"However, the advent of online interactive social media ""Web 2.0"" technologies-that is, eDTCA 2.0-may circumvent DTCA legal proscriptions."
4945,1,We conducted a descriptive study of the prevalence of eDTCA 2.0 marketing in the top 10 global pharmaceutical corporations and 10 highest grossing drugs of 2009.
4946,0,Self-help interventions without professional contact to curb adult problem drinking in the community are increasingly being delivered via the Internet.
4947,1,"In all, 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), all from high-income countries, with 9 comparison conditions and a total of 1553 participants, were identified, and their combined effectiveness in reducing alcohol consumption was evaluated by means of a meta-analysis."
4948,0,Busy clinicians need easy access to evidence-based information to inform their clinical practice. 
4949,0,Publishers and organizations have designed specific tools to meet doctors' needs at the point of care.
4950,1,"We searched Medline, Google, librarian association websites, and information conference proceedings from January to December 2008. "
4951,1,"We included English Web-based point-of-care summaries designed to deliver predigested, rapidly accessible, comprehensive, periodically updated, evidence-based information to clinicians. "
4952,1,Two investigators independently extracted data on the general characteristics and content presentation of summaries. 
4953,1,"We assessed and ranked point-of-care products according to: (1) coverage (volume) of medical conditions, (2) editorial quality, and (3) evidence-based methodology. "
4954,1,We explored how these factors were associated.
4955,2,We retrieved 30 eligible summaries. 
4956,2,"Of these products, 18 met our inclusion criteria and were qualitatively described, and 16 provided sufficient data for quantitative evaluation. "
4957,2,"The median volume of medical conditions covered was 80.6% (interquartile range, 68.9%-84.2%) and varied for the different products. "
4958,2,"Similarly, differences emerged for editorial policy (median 8.0, interquartile range 5.8-10.3) and evidence-based methodology scores (median 10.0, interquartile range 1.0-12.8) on a 15-point scale. "
4959,2,"None of these dimensions turned out to be significantly associated with the other dimensions (editorial quality and volume, Spearman rank correlation r = -0.001, P = .99; evidence-based methodology and volume, r = -0.19, P = .48; editorial and evidence-based methodology, r = 0.43, P =. "
4960,2,09).
4961,3,Publishers are moving to develop point-of-care summary products. 
4962,3,"Some of these have better profiles than others, and there is room for improved reporting of the strengths and weaknesses of these products."
4963,4,Associations of Internet Website Use With Weight Change in a Long-term Weight Loss Maintenance Program
4964,0,"The Weight Loss Maintenance Trial (WLM) compared two long-term weight-maintenance interventions, a personal contact arm and an Internet arm, with a no-treatment control after an initial six-month Phase I weight loss program. "
4965,0,The Internet arm focused on use of an interactive website for support of long-term weight maintenance. 
4966,0,There is limited information about patterns of website use and specific components of an interactive website that might help promote maintenance of weight loss.
4967,1,"Adults at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) who lost at least 4 kilograms in an initial 20-week group-based, behavioral weight-loss program were trained to use an interactive website for weight loss maintenance. "
4968,1,"Of the 348 participants, 37% were male and 38% were African American. "
4969,1,Mean weight loss was 8.6 kilograms. 
4970,1,Participants were encouraged to log in at least weekly and enter a current weight for the 30-month study period. 
4971,1,"The website contained features that encouraged setting short-term goals, creating action plans, and reinforcing self-management habits. "
4972,1,"The website also included motivational modules, daily tips, and tailored messages. "
4973,1,"Based on log-in and weight-entry frequency, we divided participants into three website use categories: consistent, some, and minimal."
4974,0,Nonresponse to questionnaires can affect the validity of surveys and introduce bias. 
4975,0,"Offering financial incentives can increase response rates to postal questionnaires, but the effect of financial incentives on response rates to online surveys is less clear."
4976,1,"A randomized controlled trial of 485 UK-based principal investigators of publicly funded health services and population health research. Participants were contacted by email and invited to complete an online questionnaire via an embedded URL. Participants were randomly allocated to groups with either ""knowledge of"" or ""no knowledge or a financial incentive (10 Amazon gift voucher) to be provided on completion of the survey. "
4977,1,"At the end of the study, gift vouchers were given to all participants who completed the questionnaire regardless of initial randomization status. "
4978,1,"Four reminder emails (sent from the same email address as the initial invitation) were sent out to nonrespondents at one, two, three, and four weeks; a fifth postal reminder was also undertaken. "
4979,1,The primary outcome measure for the trial was the response rate one week after the second reminder. 
4980,1,"Response rate was also measured at the end of weeks one, two, three, four, and five, and after a postal reminder was sent."
4981,2,"In total, 243 (50%) questionnaires were returned (232 completed, 11 in which participation was declined). "
4982,2,"One week after the second reminder, the response rate in the ""knowledge"" group was 27% (66/244) versus 20% (49/241) in the ""no knowledge"" group (x(1)(2) = 3.0, P = .08). "
4983,2,The odds ratio for responding among those with knowledge of an incentive was 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 - 2.21). 
4984,2,"At the third reminder, participants in the ""no knowledge"" group were informed about the incentive, ending the randomized element of the study. "
4985,2,"However we continued to follow up all participants, and from reminder three onwards, no significant differences were observed in the response rates of the two groups."
4986,3,Knowledge of a financial incentive did not significantly increase the response rate to an online questionnaire. 
4987,3,Future surveys should consider including a randomized element to further test the utility of offering incentives of other types and amounts to participate in online questionnaires.
4988,4,A Web-Based Nutrition Program Reduces Health Care Costs in Employees With Cardiac Risk Factors: Before and After Cost Analysis
4989,0,Rising health insurance premiums represent a rapidly increasing burden on employer-sponsors of health insurance and their employees. 
4990,0,Some employers have become proactive in managing health care costs by providing tools to encourage employees to directly manage their health and prevent disease. 
4991,0,"One example of such a tool is DASH for Health, an Internet-based nutrition and exercise behavior modification program. "
4992,0,"This program was offered as a free, opt-in benefit to US-based employees of the EMC Corporation."
4993,1,"There were 15,237 total employees and spouses who were included in our analyses, of whom 1967 enrolled in the DASH for Health program (DASH participants). "
4994,1,"Using a retrospective, quasi-experimental design, study year health care costs among DASH participants and non-participants were compared, controlling for baseline year costs, risk, and demographic variables. "
4995,1,The relationship between how often a subject visited the DASH website and health care costs also was examined. 
4996,1,"These relationships were examined among all study subjects and among a subgroup of 735 subjects with cardiovascular conditions (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). "
4997,1,"Multiple linear regression analysis examined the relationship of program use to health care costs, comparing study year costs among DASH participants and non-participants and then examining the effects of increased website use on health care costs. "
4998,1,Analyses were repeated among the cardiovascular condition subgroups.
4999,2,"Overall, program use was not associated with changes in health care costs, However, among the cardiovascular risk study subjects, health care costs were US$827 lower, on average, during the study year (P=.05; t(729) = 1.95). "
5000,2,"Among 1028 program users, increased website use was significantly associated with lower health care costs among those who visited the website at least nine times during the study year (US$14 decrease per visit; P=.04; t(1022) = 2.05), with annual savings highest among 80 program users with targeted conditions (US$55 decrease per visit; P < .001; t(74) 2.71)."
5001,3,"An employer-sponsored, Internet-based diet and exercise program shows promise as a low-cost benefit that contributes to lower health care costs among persons at higher risk for above-average health care costs and utilization."
5002,4,Comparison of Two Internet-Based Interventions for Problem Drinkers: Randomized Controlled Trial
5003,0,Internet-based interventions to assist in diabetes management have the potential to provide patients with the information and support they need to become effective self-managers.
5004,1,"For a period of 6 months, 17 patients joined the virtual clinic. "
5005,1,"The system allowed patients to communicate with health professionals, interact with peers and access information. "
5006,1,"HbA1c, quality of life, and self-efficacy were monitored at baseline and after 6 months. "
5007,1,Questionnaires and qualitative interviews examined patient experiences.
5008,2,Participants found the virtual clinic easy to use and positively rated its design. 
5009,2,Peer support was the most valued aspect and the discussion boards the most used component. 
5010,2,"All participants highly rated the virtual clinic in terms of improving communication with peers, but few agreed it had improved communication with health care professionals. "
5011,2,No significant improvements in physiological and psychological measurements were found. 
5012,2,"Regarding HbA1c measurements, there was no significant difference found between the pre- and post-test results (P = .53). "
5013,2,"Mean ADDQoL scores at baseline were -2.1 (SD 1.1, range -3.4 to -0.5) compared to -2.0 (SD 1.2, range, -4.6 to -0.4) post-test (n = 12), (P = .62). "
5014,2,"Surprisingly, patients' confidence in their ability to perform self-care tasks was found to be significantly reduced from baseline to follow up (P = .045)."
5015,3,An Intemet-based system to aid the management of diabetes appears feasible and well accepted by patients. 
5016,3,The pilot study did not identify evidence of an impact on improving quality of life or self-efficacy in patients who used insulin pump therapy.
5017,4,A Text Message-Based Intervention for Weight Loss: Randomized Controlled Trial
5018,0,"To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated whether weight loss can be promoted in overweight adults through the use of an intervention that is largely based on daily SMS (Short Message Service: text) and MMS (Multimedia Message Service: small picture) messages transmitted via mobile phones."
5019,1,"The study was a randomized controlled trial, with participants being exposed to one of the following two conditions, lasting 16 weeks: (1) receipt of monthly printed materials about weight control; (2) an intervention that included personalized SMS and MMS messages sent two to five times daily, printed materials, and brief monthly phone calls from a health counselor. "
5020,1,The primary outcome was weight at the end of the intervention. 
5021,1,A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis compared the effect of the intervention group to the comparison group on weight status over the 4-month intervention period. 
5022,1,"Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models examined weight change between baseline and 4 months after adjusting for baseline weight, sex, and age."
5023,2,"A total of 75 overweight men and women were randomized into one of the two groups, and 65 signed the consent form, completed the baseline questionnaire, and were included in the analysis. "
5024,2,"At the end of 4 months, the intervention group (n = 33) lost more weight than the comparison group (-1.97 kg difference, 95% CI -0.34 to -3.60 kg, P = .02) after adjusting for sex and age. "
5025,2,Intervention participants' adjusted average weight loss was 2.88 kg (3.16%). 
5026,2,"At the end of the study, 22 of 24 (92%) intervention participants stated that they would recommend the intervention for weight control to friends and family."
5027,3,Text messages might prove to be a productive channel of communication to promote behaviors that support weight loss in overweight adults.
5028,1,We evaluated a PCHR-based employee health promotion program using a randomized controlled trial design. 
5029,1,Employees at Hewlett Packard work sites who reported reliable Internet access and email use at least once every 2 days were recruited for participation. 
5030,1,"PCHRs were provided to all participants for survey administration, and tailored, targeted health messages on influenza illness and prevention were delivered to participants in the intervention group. "
5031,1,Participants in the control group received messages addressing cardiovascular health and sun protection. 
5032,1,"The main outcome measure was improvement in knowledge, beliefs, and behavior around influenza prevention. "
5033,1,"Secondary outcomes were influenza vaccine rates among household members, the impact of cardiovascular health and sun protection messages on the control group, and the usability and utility of the PCHR-based program for employees."
5034,2,The intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on the influenza knowledge elements we assessed but did impact certain beliefs surrounding influenza. 
5035,2,"Participants in the intervention group were more likely to believe that the influenza vaccine was effective (OR = 5.6; 95% CI = 1.7-18.5), that there were actions they could take to prevent the flu (OR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.1-9.2), and that the influenza vaccine was unlikely to cause a severe reaction (OR = 4.4; 95% CI = 1.3-15.3). "
5036,2,Immunization rates did not differ between the intervention and control groups. 
5037,2,"However, participants in the intervention group were more likely to stay home during an infectious respiratory illness compared with participants in the control group (39% [16/41] vs 14% [5/35], respectively; P=.02). "
5038,2,The program also succeeded in improving recognition of the signs of heart attack and stroke among participants in the control group. 
5039,2,"Overall, 78% of participants rated the PCHR as ""extremely/very"" easy to use, and 73% responded that they would be ""extremely/very"" likely to participate again in a PCHR-based health promotion system such as this one."
5040,3,"With a small sample size, this study identified a modest impact of a PCHR-based employee health program on influenza prevention and control. "
5041,3,"Employees found the PCHR acceptable and easy to use, suggesting that it should be explored as a common medium for health promotion in the workplace."
5042,4,"Social Uses of Personal Health Information Within PatientsLikeMe, an Online Patient Community: What Can Happen When Patients Have Access to One Anothers Data"
5043,0,This project investigates the ways in which patients respond to the shared use of what is often considered private information: personal health data. 
5044,0,There is a growing demand for patient access to personal health records. 
5045,0,The predominant model for this record is a repository of all clinically relevant health information kept securely and viewed privately by patients and their health care providers. 
5046,0,"While this type of record does seem to have beneficial effects for the patient-physician relationship, the complexity and novelty of these data coupled with the lack of research in this area means the utility of personal health information for the primary stakeholders-the patients-is not well documented or understood."
5047,1,"Patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) post data on their current treatments, symptoms, and outcomes. "
5048,1,These data are displayed graphically within personal health profiles and are reflected in composite community-level symptom and treatment reports. 
5049,1,"Users review and discuss these data within the Forum, private messaging, and comments posted on each other's profiles. "
5050,1,We analyzed member communications that referenced individual-level personal health data to determine how patient peers use personal health information within patient-to-patient exchanges.
5051,2,Qualitative analysis of a sample of 123 comments (about 2% of the total) posted within the community revealed a variety of commenting and questioning behaviors by patient members. 
5052,2,"Members referenced data to locate others with particular experiences to answer specific health-related questions, to proffer personally acquired disease-management knowledge to those most likely to benefit from it, and to foster and solidify relationships based on shared concerns."
5053,3,Few studies examine the use of personal health information by patients themselves. 
5054,3,"This project suggests how patients who choose to explicitly share health data within a community may benefit from the process, helping them engage in dialogues that may inform disease self-management. "
5055,3,"We recommend that future designs make each patient's health information as clear as possible, automate matching of people with similar conditions and using similar treatments, and integrate data into online platforms for health conversations."
5056,4,Internet-Based Treatment for Adults with Depressive Symptoms: Randomized Controlled Trial
5057,0,"Many depressed people do not receive help for their symptoms, and there are various barriers that impede help-seeking. "
5058,0,The Internet may offer interesting alternatives for reaching and helping people with depression. 
5059,0,"Depression can be treated effectively with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but a short intervention based on problem solving therapy (PST) could constitute a worthwhile alternative to CBT."
5060,1,"We conducted a 3-arm randomized controlled trial to compare CBT, PST, and WL. "
5061,1,The main inclusion criterion was presence of depressive symptoms (>= 16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale). 
5062,1,CBT and PST consisted of eight and five weekly lessons respectively. 
5063,1,Participants were supported by email. 
5064,1,"Self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and quality of life were completed at pretest and after 5, 8, and 12 weeks."
5065,2,A total of 263 participants were randomized to the three conditions (CBT: n=88; PST: n=88; WL: n=87). 
5066,2,"Of the 263 participants, 184 (70%) completed questionnaires after 5 weeks, 173 (66%) after 8 weeks, and 151 (57%) after 12 weeks. "
5067,2,Between-group effect sizes for depressive symptoms were 0.54 for CBT after 8 weeks (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25 - 0.84) and 0.47 for PST after 5 weeks (95% CI: 0.17 - 0.77). 
5068,2,"These effects were further improved at 12 weeks (CBT: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.41 - 0.98; PST: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.36 - 0.95). "
5069,2,"For anxiety, effect sizes were also at a medium level. "
5070,2,Effect sizes for quality of life were low. 
5071,2,"The number of participants showing clinically significant change at 12 weeks was significantly higher for CBT (n 34, 38.6%) and PST (n = 30, 34.1 %), compared to WL (n = 0)."
5072,3,"Both Internet-based treatments are effective in reducing depressive symptoms, although the effect of PST is realized more quickly.Trial Registration: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN): 16823487; http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN16823487/16823487 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/5cQsOj7xf)."
5073,4,Feasibility of a mobile phone-based data service for functional insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus patients
5074,0,Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) have to be active participants in their treatment because they are inevitably responsible for their own day-to-day-care. 
5075,0,Availability of mobile Internet access is advancing rapidly and mobile phones are now widely available at low cost. 
5076,0,"Thus, mobile phones have the potential to assist in daily diabetes management and to enable a telemedical interaction between patients and health care professionals."
5077,1,A software application called Diab-Memory (based on Java 2 Mobile Edition) has been developed to support patients when entering diabetes-related data with synchronization to the remote database at the monitoring center. 
5078,1,"The data were then processed to generate statistics and trends, which were provided for the patient and his/her health care professional via a Web portal. "
5079,1,The system has been evaluated in the course of a clinical before-after pilot trial. 
5080,1,"Outcome measures focused on patients' adherence to the therapy, availability of the monitoring system, and the effects on metabolic status. "
5081,1,General user acceptance of the system was evaluated using a questionnaire.
5082,0,US adults report suboptimal physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake. 
5083,0,Innovative strategies to promote healthy behaviors are needed. 
5084,0,Employee health promotion programs have been associated with reductions in health risks but are labor-intensive and costly to implement. 
5085,0,Email and Web-based worksite programs have the potential to reach a broad adult population and to provide a cost-effective approach to employee wellness programming.
5086,1,Employees at one worksite of a large insurance company in New York State were invited to participate. 
5087,1,Interested workers provided written consent. 
5088,1,"After completing a baseline survey, participants received daily emails, Monday through Friday, for 26 weeks. "
5089,1,The emails provided (a) succinct strategies to encourage physical activity or increase fruit and vegetable intake and (b) links to detailed Web-based information and tools. 
5090,1,"Program reach was assessed by the number of emails opened, measures of sustained participation over 6 months, and the number of health-related Web-links clicked."
5091,2,"Of 960 employees, 388 (40%) consented to participate; of these, 345 (89%) completed the baseline health survey. "
5092,2,"After 6 months, 70% of the 345 participants had opened 50% or more of the daily emails. "
5093,2,"In addition, 75% of participants continued to open at least one email a week through week 26 of the study. "
5094,2,"Email opening rates did not vary by gender, age, income, education, ethnicity, or baseline health behavior."
5095,3,"The rate of enrollment and sustained participation document the feasibility, broad reach, employee acceptance, and potential value of using electronic communications for health promotion in the workplace."
5096,4,Information needs and visitors experience of an Internet expert forum on infertility
5097,0,"Patients increasingly use health portals and Web-based expert forums (ask-the-doctor services), but little is known about the specific needs of Internet users visiting such websites, the nature of their requests, or how satisfied they are with Internet health experts."
5098,1,We posted an electronic questionnaire on a website hosting an expert forum on involuntary childlessness. 
5099,1,"The questionnaire was ""activated"" whenever a visitor sent a question or request to the expert forum. "
5100,1,The survey focused on the reasons for visiting the expert forum and whether the visitors were satisfied with the experts' answers to previously posted questions. 
5101,1,"The free-text questions of visitors who answered the survey were analyzed using Atlas-ti, a software program for qualitative data analysis."
5102,2,"Over a period of 6 months, 513 out of 6 10 visitors (84%) answered the questionnaire. "
5103,2,"The majority of respondents (65.5%) expected general information about involuntary childlessness, conception, or an evaluation of drugs. "
5104,2,Others were concerned about their actual treatment (40.6%) and therapeutic options (28.8%). 
5105,2,"Out of 225 respondents who had previously contacted the forum, 223 had received an answer, and 123 (55.2%) were satisfied with the experts' answers. "
5106,2,About half (105/223) of those users who had previously received an answer from the expert forum stated that they had discussed it with their own doctor. 
5107,2,More of these users were satisfied with their subsequent care in fertility clinics than users who did not talk to their doctor about their Internet activities (93.9% vs 76. 
5108,2,1%; P = .015). 
5109,2,"According to the qualitative analysis, many requests (n = 194) were more or less trivial, especially those for information on basic aspects of reproduction. "
5110,2,More than one-third of visitors (n = 199) sent detailed results of diagnostic tests and asked for a first or second opinion. 
5111,2,Requests to the expert forum were also sent in order to obtain emotional support (17%) or to complain about a doctor (15%).
5112,3,Visitors who sent their laboratory findings to receive a thorough evaluation or a second opinion had a good command of the opportunities that an expert forum offers. 
5113,3,"One important expectation of the forum was emotional support, indicating psychological needs that were not met by medical providers. "
5114,3,"Future websites must find a compromise in order to protect experts from being overwhelmed by general, nonspecific requests while supporting patients with individualized answers."
5115,1,Qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 patients who used a secure communication system (MedAxess) to exchange personal health information with their primary care physician.
5116,2,"Six main themes were identified from the interviews: (1) supporting simple questions, (2) security issues, (3) aspects of written communication, (4) trust in the physician, (5) simplicity of MedAxess, and (6) trouble using the system. "
5117,2,"By using the system, about half of the patients (8/15) experienced easier access to their physician, with whom they tended to solve minor health problems and elaborate on more complex illness experiences. "
5118,2,Two thirds of the respondents (10/15) found that their physician quickly responded to their MedAxess requests. 
5119,2,"As a result of the security barriers, the users felt that the system was secure. "
5120,2,"However, due to the same barriers, the patients considered the log-in procedure cumbersome, which had considerable negative impact on the actual use of the system."
5121,3,"Despite a perceived need for secure electronic patient-physician communication systems, security barriers may diminish their overall usefulness. "
5122,3,"A dual approach is necessary to improve this situation: patients need to be better informed about security issues, and, at the same time, their experiences of using secure systems must be studied and used to improve user interfaces."
5123,4,Computers and the Internet: Tools for youth empowerment
5124,0,Youth are often disenfranchised in their communities and may feel they have little voice. 
5125,0,"Since computers are an important aspect of youth culture, they may offer solutions to increasing youth participation in communities."
5126,1,"Youth working with public health nurses in a school-based community development project communicated with local community members using computer-mediated communication, surveyed peers online, built websites, searched for information online, and prepared project materials using computers and the Internet. "
5127,1,"Participant observation, semistructured interviews, analysis of online messages, and online- and paper-based surveys were used to gather data about youth's and adults' perceptions and use of the technologies. "
5128,1,Constant comparison method and between-method triangulation were used in the analysis to satisfy the existence of themes.
5129,2,Not all youth were interested in working with computers. 
5130,2,"Some electronic messages from adults were perceived to be critical, and writing to adults was intimidating for some youth. "
5131,2,"In addition, technical problems were experienced. "
5132,2,"Despite these barriers, most youth perceived that using computers and the Internet reduced their anxiety concerning communication with adults, increased their control when dealing with adults, raised their perception of their social status, increased participation within the community, supported reflective thought, increased efficiency, and improved their access to resources."
5133,3,"Overall, youth perceived computers and the Internet to be empowering tools, and they should be encouraged to use such technology to support them in community initiatives."
5134,2,"Of the 21 LASIK Web sites visited, 17 were commercial. "
5135,2,"Of the 21 Web sites, 5 (24%) had no information on complications. "
5136,2,"Of the 16 sites that had information on complications the author of the information was clearly identified in 5 (31%), the content was only referenced in 2 (12.5%), and evidence of the information having been updated was only seen in 2 (12.5%). "

5146,4,Users of Internet Health Information: Differences by Health Status
5147,0,Millions of consumers have accessed health information online. 
5148,0,"However, little is known about their health status."
5149,1,"A national, random-digit telephone survey by the Pew Internet & American Life Project identified 521 Internet users who go online for health care information. "
5150,1,"Our primary independent variable was general health status rated as excellent, good, fair, or poor. "
5151,1,"Patterns of Internet use, and types of information searched were assessed."
5152,2,"Among the 521 users, 64% were female, most (87%) were white, and median age was 42 years. "
5153,2,Most individuals indicated that they learned something new online (81%) and indicated that they believe most information on the Internet (52%). 
5154,2,"Compared with those with excellent/good health, those with fair/poor health (N = 59) were relative newcomers to the Internet but tended to use the Internet more frequently, were more likely to use online chats, were less likely to search for someone other than themselves, and were more likely to talk about the new information with their physician (odds ratio 3.3 [95% confidence interval 1.8-6.3]), after adjustment for age, education and income."
5155,3,Health care professionals should be aware that their sicker patients are more likely to ask them about information they found online. 
5156,3,"Physicians, public health professionals, and eHealth developers should work together to educate patients about searching for health information online and to provide tools for them to navigate to the highest quality information."
5157,4,Approaches to Research Ethics in Health Research on YouTube: Systematic Review
5158,0,"YouTube has become a popular source of health care information, reaching an estimated 81% of adults in 2021; approximately 35% of adults in the United States have used the internet to self-diagnose a condition. "
5159,0,"Public health researchers are therefore incorporating YouTube data into their research, but guidelines for best practices around research ethics using social media data, such as YouTube, are unclear."
5160,1,"We implemented a systematic review of articles found in PubMed, SocINDEX, Web of Science, and PsycINFO following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. "
5161,1,"To be eligible to be included, studies needed to be published in peer-reviewed journals in English between January 1, 2006, and October 31, 2019, and include analyses on publicly available YouTube data on health or public health topics; studies using primary data collection, such as using YouTube for study recruitment, interventions, or dissemination evaluations, were not included. "
5162,1,"We extracted data on the presence of user identifying information, institutional review board (IRB) review, and informed consent processes, as well as research topic and methodology."
5163,2,This review includes 119 articles from 88 journals. 
5164,2,"The most common health and public health topics studied were in the categories of chronic diseases (44/119, 37%), mental health and substance use (26/119, 21.8%), and infectious diseases (20/119, 16.8%). "
5165,2,"The majority (82/119, 68.9%) of articles made no mention of ethical considerations or stated that the study did not meet the definition of human participant research (16/119, 13.4%). "
5166,2,"Of those that sought IRB review (15/119, 12.6%), 12 out of 15 (80%) were determined to not meet the definition of human participant research and were therefore exempt from IRB review, and 3 out of 15 (20%) received IRB approval. "
5167,2,None of the 3 IRB-approved studies contained identifying information; one was explicitly told not to include identifying information by their ethics committee. 
5168,2,Only 1 study sought informed consent from YouTube users. 
5169,2,"Of 119 articles, 33 (27.7%) contained identifying information about content creators or video commenters, one of which attempted to anonymize direct quotes by not including user information."
5170,3,"Given the variation in practice, concrete guidelines on research ethics for social media research are needed, especially around anonymizing and seeking consent when using identifying information."
5171,4,Electronic Health Record-Driven Approaches in Primary Care to Strengthen Hypertension Management Among Racial and Ethnic Minoritized Groups in the United States: Systematic Review
5172,0,"Managing hypertension in racial and ethnic minoritized groups (eg, African American/Black patients) in primary care is highly relevant. "
5173,0,"However, evidence on whether or how electronic health record (EHR)-driven approaches in primary care can help improve hypertension management for patients of racial and ethnic minoritized groups in the United States remains scarce."
5174,1,"A search strategy based on the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) guidelines was utilized to query and identify peer-reviewed articles on the Web of Science and PubMed databases. "
5175,1,"The search strategy was based on terms related to racial and ethnic minoritized groups, hypertension, primary care, and EHR-driven interventions. "
5176,1,Articles were excluded if the focus was not hypertension management in racial and ethnic minoritized groups or if there was no mention of health record data utilization.
5177,2,A total of 29 articles were included in this review. 
5178,2,"Regarding populations, Black/African American patients represented the largest population (26/29, 90%) followed by Hispanic/Latino (18/29, 62%), Asian American (7/29, 24%), and American Indian/Alaskan Native (2/29, 7%) patients. "
5179,2,No study included patients who identified as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. 
5180,2,"The EHR was used to identify patients (25/29, 86%), drive the intervention (21/29, 72%), and monitor results and outcomes (7/29, 59%). "
5181,2,"Most often, EHR-driven approaches were used for health coaching interventions, disease management programs, clinical decision support (CDS) systems, and best practice alerts (BPAs). "
5182,2,"Regarding outcomes, out of 8 EHR-driven health coaching interventions, only 3 (38%) reported significant results. "
5183,2,"In contrast, all the included studies related to CDS and BPA applications reported some significant results with respect to improving hypertension management."
5184,3,This review identified several use cases for the integration of the EHR in supporting primary care interventions to strengthen hypertension management in racial and ethnic minoritized patients in the United States. 
5185,3,Some clinical-based interventions implementing CDS and BPA applications showed promising results. 
5186,3,"However, more research is needed on community-based interventions, particularly those focusing on patients who are Asian American, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. "
5187,3,"The developed taxonomy comprising ""identifying patients,"" ""driving intervention,"" and ""monitoring results"" to classify EHR-driven approaches can be a helpful tool to facilitate this."
5188,4,Development and Evaluation of eHealth Services Regarding Accessibility: Scoping Literature Review
5189,0,Accessibility is acknowledged as a key to inclusion in the Convention of Rights for People with Disabilities. 
5190,0,An inaccessible design can result in exclusion from eHealth and cause disability among people who have impairments.
5191,1,"In line with Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping studies and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), we conducted a search in 4 databases (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE, and Web of Science) in October 2020 and an update of the search in June 2022. "
5192,1,"The search strategy was structured according to the PICO model as follows: Population/Problem, digital accessibility for users with impairment; Intervention, health care delivered by any digital solution; Comparison, not applicable; Outcome, use of and adherence to (1) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), (2) other accessibility guidelines, and (3) other means, for designing or evaluating accessibility in eHealth services. "
5193,1,A Boolean search was conducted by combining terms related to accessibility and eHealth. 
5194,1,All authors participated in screening abstracts according to the eligibility criteria. 
5195,1,"Each publication, containing a potentially relevant abstract, was read (full text) and assessed for eligibility by 2 authors independently and pairwise. "
5196,1,Publications deemed eligible were read by all authors and discussed for consensus.
5197,2,A total of 8643 publications were identified. 
5198,2,"After abstract screening, 131 publications remained for full-text reading. "
5199,2,"Of those, 116 publications were excluded as they did not meet the eligibility criteria. "
5200,2,Fifteen publications involving studies of 12 eHealth services were included in the study. 
5201,2,"Of the 15 publications, 2 provided a definition of accessibility, 5 provided an explanation of accessibility, and 8 did not provide any explanation. "
5202,2,Five publications used the WCAG to evaluate accessibility when developing eHealth services. 
5203,2,"One publication used International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 29138, ISO 2941, and ISO/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 30071-1 standards together with the Spanish Association for Standardization (UNE) 139803 standard. "
5204,2,"Eleven publications used other means to address accessibility, including text-level grading; literature review about accessibility; user tests, focus groups, interviews, and design workshops with target groups of patients, relatives, and health care professionals; and comparative analysis of existing technical solutions to provide information about useful requirements."
5205,3,"Although a clear definition of accessibility can enhance operationalization and thus measurability when evaluating accessibility in eHealth services, accessibility was insufficiently defined in most of the included studies. "
5206,3,"Further, accessibility guidelines and standards were used to a very limited extent in the development and evaluation of eHealth services. "
5207,3,Guidelines for developing complex interventions that include guidance for accessibility are motivated to ensure that accessibility will be considered systematically in eHealth services.
5208,4,Smartphone App-Based and Paper-Based Patient-Reported Outcomes Using a Disease-Specific Questionnaire for Dry Eye Disease: Randomized Crossover Equivalence Study
5209,0,"Using traditional patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as paper-based questionnaires, is cumbersome in the era of web-based medical consultation and telemedicine. "
5210,0,Electronic PROs may reduce the burden on patients if implemented widely. 
5211,0,"Considering promising reports of DryEyeRhythm, our in-house mHealth smartphone app for investigating dry eye disease (DED) and the electronic and paper-based Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) should be evaluated and compared to determine their equivalency."
5212,1,"This prospective, nonblinded, randomized crossover study enrolled 34 participants between April 2022 and June 2022 at a university hospital in Japan. "
5213,1,The participants were allocated randomly into 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio. 
5214,1,"The paper-app group initially responded to the paper-based Japanese version of the OSDI (J-OSDI), followed by the app-based J-OSDI. "
5215,1,The app-paper group responded to similar questionnaires but in reverse order. 
5216,1,We performed an equivalence test based on minimal clinically important differences to assess the equivalence of the J-OSDI total scores between the 2 platforms (paper-based vs app-based). 
5217,1,A 95% CI of the mean difference between the J-OSDI total scores within the & PLUSMN;7.0 range between the 2 platforms indicated equivalence. 
5218,1,The internal consistency and agreement of the app-based J-OSDI were assessed with Cronbach & alpha; coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficient values.
5219,2,A total of 33 participants were included in this study. 
5220,2,"The total scores for the app-and paper-based J-OSDI indicated satisfactory equivalence per our study definition (mean difference 1.8, 95% CI -1.4 to 5.0). "
5221,2,"Moreover, the app-based J-OSDI total score demonstrated good internal consistency and agreement (Cronbach & alpha;=.958; intraclass correlation=0.919; 95% CI 0.842 to 0.959) and was significantly correlated with its paper-based counterpart (Pearson correlation=0.932, P<.001)."
5222,3,This study demonstrated the equivalence of PROs between the app-and paper-based J-OSDI. 
5223,4,Digital Endpoints for Assessing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Systematic Review
5224,0,Subtle impairments in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) can be a key predictor of disease progression and are considered central to functional independence. 
5225,0,Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndrome associated with significant changes in cognitive function and mild impairment in complex functional abilities. 
5226,0,The early detection of functional decline through the identification of IADL impairments can aid early intervention strategies. 
5227,0,Digital health technology is an objective method of capturing IADL-related behaviors. 
5228,0,"However, it is unclear how these IADL-related behaviors have been digitally assessed in the literature and what differences can be observed between MCI and normal aging."
5229,1,"A total of 16,099 articles were identified from 8 databases (CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus), out of which 15 were included in this review. "
5230,1,The included studies must have used continuous remote digital measures to assess IADL-related behaviors in adults characterized as having MCI by clinical diagnosis or assessment. 
5231,1,This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.
5232,2,"Ambient technology was the most commonly used digital method to assess IADL-related behaviors in the included studies (14/15, 93%), with passive infrared motion sensors (5/15, 33%) and contact sensors (5/15, 33%) being the most prevalent types of methods. "
5233,2,"Digital technologies were used to assess IADL-related behaviors across 5 domains: activities outside of the home, everyday technology use, household and personal management, medication management, and orientation. "
5234,2,Other recognized domains-culturally specific tasks and socialization and communication-were not assessed. 
5235,2,"Of the 79 metrics recorded among 11 types of technologies, 65 (82%) were used only once. "
5236,2,"There were inconsistent findings around differences in digital IADL endpoints across the cognitive spectrum, with limited longitudinal assessment of how they changed over time."
5237,3,"Despite the broad range of metrics and methods used to digitally assess IADL-related behaviors in people with MCI, several IADLs relevant to functional decline were not studied. "
5238,3,Measuring multiple IADL-related digital endpoints could offer more value than the measurement of discrete IADL outcomes alone to observe functional decline. 
5239,3,Key recommendations include the development of suitable core metrics relevant to IADL-related behaviors that are based on clinically meaningful outcomes to aid the standardization and further validation of digital technologies against existing IADL measures. 
5240,3,Increased longitudinal monitoring is necessary to capture changes in digital IADL endpoints over time in people with MCI.
5241,4,A National Health and Wellness SMS Text Message Program for Breast Cancer Survivors During COVID-19 (EMPOWER-SMS COVID-19): Mixed Methods Evaluation Using the RE-AIM Framework
5242,0,COVID-19 lockdowns caused widespread closures of supportive care services for breast cancer survivors in Australia. 
5243,0,"In a randomized controlled trial, our team's lifestyle-focused, evidence-based SMS text message support program (EMPOWER-SMS COVID-19) was found to be acceptable and useful for breast cancer survivors, and it was ready for rapid widespread delivery."
5244,1,A mixed methods pre-post study was conducted to evaluate the EMPOWER-SMS COVID-19 program. 
5245,1,"The study evaluated the following aspects: (1) reach/representativeness, which refers to the proportion of participant enrollment (ie, number enrolled/number that visited the study website) and demographics (eg, age, sex, ethnicity, time since completing treatment, Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage [IRSAD; quintile 1, which refers to most disadvantaged areas, to quintile 5, which refers to least disadvantaged areas, and remoteness); (2) effectiveness, in which participant engagement and acceptability were evaluated using SMS text message reply data and a feedback survey (5-point Likert scale and free-text responses); (3) adoption, which corresponds to the proportion of organizations or health professionals who agreed to promote the program; (4) implementation fidelity and maintenance, which evaluated SMS text message delivery data, opt-outs, costs, and adaptations. "
5246,1,"Quantitative data were summarized using means and SDs or frequencies and percentages, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically."
5247,2,"With regard to the reach/representativeness of the program, 841/1340 (62.8%) participants enrolled and provided electronic consent. "
5248,2,Participants had a mean age of 58.8 (SD 9.8; range 30-87) years. 
5249,2,"According to the data collected, most participants identified as female (837/840, 99.6%) and White (736/840, 87.6%) and nearly half (418/841, 49.7%) finished treatment & LE;18 months ago. "
5250,2,"Most resided in major cities (574/838, 68.5%) and 30% (251/838) in IRSAD quintile 1 or 2. "
5251,2,"In terms of effectiveness, 852 replies were received from 511 unique participants (median 1; range 1-26). "
5252,2,"The most common replies were participants stating how they heard about the program (467/852, 54.8%) or ""thank you"" (131/852, 15.4%). "
5253,2,None of the replies contained urgent safety concerns. 
5254,2,"Among participants who provided feedback (449/841, 53.4%), most ""(strongly) agreed"" the SMS text messages were easy to understand (445/448, 99.3%), useful (373/440, 84.8%), helped participants feel supported (388/448, 86.6%), and motivated participants to be physically active (312/445, 70.1%) and eat healthier (313/457, 68.5%). "
5255,2,"Free-text responses revealed 5 factors influencing engagement: (1) feeling supported and less alone, (2) motivation and reassurance for health self-management, (3) the variety of information, (4) weblinks to information and resources, and (5) the option to save the SMS text messages. "
5256,2,"Concerning adoption, 50% (18/36) of organizations/health professionals agreed to promote the program. "
5257,2,"With regard to implementation/maintenance, SMS text messages were delivered as planned (97.43% [41,257/42,344] of SMS text messages were successfully delivered) with minimal opt-outs (62/838, 7.4%) and low cost (Aus $15.40/participant; Aus $1=US $0.67). "
5258,2,No adaptations were made during the intervention period. 
5259,2,Postintervention adaptations included adding weblinks and participant-selected customizations.
5260,3,"EMPOWER-SMS COVID-19 was implemented quickly, had a broad reach, and had high engagement and acceptability among socioeconomically diverse participants. "
5261,3,"The program had high fidelity, low cost, and required minimal staff oversight, which may facilitate future implementation. "
5262,3,"However, further research is needed to evaluate barriers and enablers to adoption and implementation for health professionals and strategies for long-term maintenance."
5263,4,Web-Based Social Networks of Individuals With Adverse Childhood Experiences: Quantitative Study
5264,0,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which include abuse and neglect and various household challenges such as exposure to intimate partner violence and substance use in the home, can have negative impacts on the lifelong health of affected individuals. "
5265,0,Among various strategies for mitigating the adverse effects of ACEs is to enhance connectedness and social support for those who have experienced them. 
5266,0,"However, how the social networks of those who experienced ACEs differ from the social networks of those who did not is poorly understood."
5267,1,We first used a neural network classifier to identify the presence or absence of public ACE disclosures in social media posts. 
5268,1,We then analyzed egocentric social networks comparing individuals with self-reported ACEs with those with no reported history.
5269,2,"We found that, although individuals reporting ACEs had fewer total followers in web-based social networks, they had higher reciprocity in following behavior (ie, mutual following with other users), a higher tendency to follow and be followed by other individuals with ACEs, and a higher tendency to follow back individuals with ACEs rather than individuals without ACEs."
5270,3,These results imply that individuals with ACEs may try to actively connect with others who have similar previous traumatic experiences as a positive connection and coping strategy. 
5271,3,Supportive interpersonal connections on the web for individuals with ACEs appear to be a prevalent behavior and may be a way to enhance social connectedness and resilience in those who have experienced ACEs.
5272,4,Pain Reduction With an Immersive Digital Therapeutic in Women Living With Endometriosis-Related Pelvic Pain: At-Home Self-Administered Randomized Controlled Trial
5273,0,The management of chronic pelvic pain in women with endometriosis is complex and includes the long-term use of opioids. 
5274,0,Patients not fully responsive to drugs or ineligible for surgical treatments need efficient alternatives to improve their quality of life and avoid long-term sequelae.
5275,1,Patients were instructed to use the VR headsets twice daily for at least 2 days and for up to 5 days starting on their first day of painful periods. 
5276,1,"Pain perception was measured using a numerical scale (0-10) before and 60, 120, and 180 minutes after each treatment administration. "
5277,1,"General pain, stress, fatigue, medication intake, and quality of life were reported daily by patients."
5278,2,"A total of 102 patients with endometriosis were included in the final analysis (Endocare group: n=51, 50%; sham group: n=51, 50%). "
5279,2,"The mean age was 32.88 years (SD 6.96) and the mean pain intensity before treatment was 6.53 (SD 1.74) and 6.22 (SD 1.69) for the Endocare group and the sham control group, respectively (P=.48). "
5280,2,Pain intensity decreased in both groups from day 1 to day 5 along with a decrease in medication use. 
5281,2,"Maximum pain intensity reduction of 51.58% (SD 35.33) occurred at day 2, 120 minutes after treatment for the Endocare group and of 27.37% (SD 27.23) at day 3, 180 minutes after treatment for the control group. "
5282,2,"Endocare was significantly superior to the sham on day 1 (120 minutes, P=.04; 180 minutes, P=.001), day 2 (0 minutes, P=.02; 60, 120, and 180 minutes, all P<.001), and day 3 (60 minutes, P=.01; 120 minutes, P=.005; 180 minutes, P=.001). "
5283,2,"Similarly, the mean perceived pain relief was significantly higher with Endocare on day 1 (120 and 180 minutes P=.004 and P=.001, respectively) and day 2 (60, 120, and 180 minutes P=.003, P=.004, and P=.007, respectively) compared to the control. "
5284,2,No adverse event was reported.
5285,3,This study confirmed the effectiveness and safety of self-repeated administrations of a VR immersive treatment used at home while reducing overall pain medication intake in women diagnosed with endometriosis experiencing moderate-to-severe pelvic pain.
5286,4,Exploring the Use of the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy and the Persuasive System Design Model in Defining Parent-Focused eHealth Interventions: Scoping Review
5287,0,"Taxonomies and models are useful tools for defining eHealth content and intervention features, enabling comparison and analysis of research across studies and disciplines. "
5288,0,"The Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1) was developed to decrease ambiguity in defining specific characteristics inherent in health interventions, but it was developed outside the context of digital technology. "
5289,0,"In contrast, the Persuasive System Design Model (PSDM) was developed to define and evaluate the persuasive content in software solutions but did not have a specific focus on health. "
5290,0,"Both the BCTTv1 and PSDM have been used to define eHealth interventions in the literature, with some researchers combining or reducing the taxonomies to simplify their application. "
5291,0,It is unclear how well the taxonomies accurately define eHealth and whether they should be used alone or in combination.
5292,1,A scoping review was used to clarify concepts in the literature related to these taxonomies. 
5293,1,Keywords related to parent-focused eHealth were defined and used to systematically search several electronic databases for parent-focused eHealth publications. 
5294,1,Publications referencing the same intervention were combined to provide comprehensive intervention details. 
5295,1,The data set was coded using codebooks developed from the taxonomies in NVivo (version 12; QSR International) and qualitatively analyzed using matrix queries.
5296,2,"The systematic search found 23 parent-focused eHealth interventions described in 42 articles from various countries; delivered to parents with children aged 1 to 18 years; and covering medical, behavioral, and developmental issues. "
5297,2,"The predominant active ingredients and intervention features in parent-focused eHealth were concerned with teaching parents behavioral skills, encouraging them to practice and monitor the new skills, and tracking the outcomes of performing the new skills. "
5298,2,No category had a complete set of active ingredients or intervention features coded. 
5299,2,The two taxonomies conceptually captured different constructs even when their labels appeared to overlap in meaning. 
5300,2,"In addition, coding by category missed important active ingredients and intervention features."
5301,3,"The taxonomies were found to code different constructs related to behavior change and persuasive technology, discouraging the merging or reduction of the taxonomies. "
5302,3,This scoping review highlighted the benefit of using both taxonomies in their entirety to capture active ingredients and intervention features important for comparing and analyzing eHealth across different studies and disciplines.
5303,4,Novel Software for High-level Virological Testing: Self-Designed Immersive Virtual Reality Training Approach
5304,0,"To ensure the timely diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases, high-tech molecular biotechnology is often used to detect pathogens and has gradually become the gold standard for virological testing. "
5305,0,"However, beginners and students are often unable to practice their skills due to the higher costs associated with high-level virological testing, the increasing complexity of the equipment, and the limited number of specimens from patients. "
5306,0,"Therefore, a new training program is necessary to increase training and reduce the risk of test failure."
5307,1,Viral nucleic acid tests on a BD MAX instrument were selected for our VR project because it is a high-tech automatic detection system. 
5308,1,There was cooperation between teachers of medical technology and biomedical engineering. 
5309,1,"Medical technology teachers were responsible for designing the lesson plan, and the biomedical engineering personnel developed the VR software. "
5310,1,We designed a novel VR teaching software to simulate cognitive learning via various procedure scenarios and interactive models. 
5311,1,"The VR software contains 2D VR ""cognitive test and learning"" lessons and 3D VR ""practical skills training"" lessons. "
5312,1,"We evaluated students' learning effectiveness pre-and posttraining and then recorded their behavior patterns when answering questions, performing repeated exercises, and engaging in clinical practice."
5313,2,The results showed that the use of the VR software met participants' needs and enhanced their interest in learning. 
5314,2,The average posttraining scores of participants exposed to 2D and 3D VR training were significantly higher than participants who were exposed solely to traditional demonstration teaching (P<.001). 
5315,2,Behavioral assessments of students pre-and posttraining showed that students exposed to VR-based training to acquire relevant knowledge of advanced virological testing exhibited significantly improved knowledge of specific items posttraining (P<.01). 
5316,2,A higher participant score led to fewer attempts when responding to each item in a matching task. 
5317,2,"Thus, VR can enhance students' understanding of difficult topics."
5318,3,"The VR program designed for this study can reduce the costs associated with virological testing training, thus, increasing their accessibility for students and beginners. "
5319,3,"It can also reduce the risk of viral infections particularly during disease outbreaks (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic) and also enhance students' learning motivation to strengthen their practical skills."
5320,4,Using Digital Tools to Study the Health of Adults Born Preterm at a Large Scale: e-Cohort Pilot Study
5321,0,Preterm birth is a global health concern. 
5322,0,"Its adverse consequences may persist throughout the life course, exerting a potentially heavy burden on families, health systems, and societies. "
5323,0,"In high-income countries, the first children who benefited from improved care are now adults entering middle age. "
5324,0,"However, there is a clear gap in the knowledge regarding the long-term outcomes of individuals born preterm."
5325,1,"We implemented a prospective, open, observational, and international e-cohort pilot study (Health of Adult People Born Preterm-an e-Cohort Pilot Study [HAPP-e]). "
5326,1,"Inclusion criteria were being an adult (aged =18 years), born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation), having internet access and an email address, and understanding at least 1 of the available languages. "
5327,1,"A large, multifaceted, and multilingual communication strategy was established. "
5328,1,"Between December 2019 and June 2021, inclusion and repeated data collection were performed using a secured web platform. "
5329,1,"We provided descriptive statistics regarding participation in the e-cohort, namely, the number of persons who registered on the platform, signed the consent form, initiated and completed the baseline questionnaire, and initiated and completed the follow-up questionnaire. "
5330,1,We also described the main characteristics of the HAPP-e participants and provided an assessment of the quality of the data and the acceptability of sensitive questions.
5331,2,"As of December 31, 2020, a total of 1004 persons had registered on the platform, leading to 527 accounts with a confirmed email and 333 signed consent forms. "
5332,2,A total of 333 participants initiated the baseline questionnaire. 
5333,2,"All participants were invited to follow-up, and 35.7% (119/333) consented to participate, of whom 97.5% (116/119) initiated the follow-up questionnaire. "
5334,2,"Completion rates were very high both at baseline (296/333, 88.9%) and at follow-up (112/116, 96.6%). "
5335,2,This sample of adults born preterm in 34 countries covered a wide range of sociodemographic and health characteristics. 
5336,2,"The gestational age at birth ranged from 23+6 to 36+6 weeks (median 32, IQR 29-35 weeks). "
5337,2,Only 2.1% (7/333) of the participants had previously participated in a cohort of individuals born preterm. 
5338,2,"Women (252/333, 75.7%) and highly educated participants (235/327, 71.9%) were also overrepresented. "
5339,2,Good quality data were collected thanks to validation controls implemented on the web platform. 
5340,2,"The acceptability of potentially sensitive questions was excellent, as very few participants chose the ""I prefer not to say"" option when available."
5341,3,"Although we identified room for improvement in specific procedures, this pilot study confirmed the great potential for recruiting a large and diverse sample of adults born preterm worldwide, thereby advancing research on adults born preterm."
5342,4,Conceptualizing and Measuring Social Media Use in Health and Well-being Studies: Systematic Review
5343,0,"Despite an increasing number of studies revealing both the benefits and harms of social media use on well-being, there is heterogeneity and a lack of consensus on how social media use is conceptualized, defined, and measured. "
5344,0,"Additionally, little is known whether existing literature focuses on ill-being or well-being outcomes and whether studies use theories."
5345,1,Studies were located through a comprehensive search strategy involving 4 steps. 
5346,1,"First, keyword searches were conducted on 6 major databases: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase, ProQuest, and Annual Reviews. "
5347,1,"Second, a search was conducted on Google Scholar using the same sets of search terms, and the first 100 results were examined. "
5348,1,"Third, the reference sections of reviews identified in the first 2 rounds of searches were examined, and finally, the reference lists of the final set of papers included in the review were searched. "
5349,1,"Through a multistage screening, papers that met our inclusion criteria were analyzed."
5350,2,The review included a total of 233 papers published between 2007 and 2020 in 51 different countries. 
5351,2,"While 66 (28%) of the studies investigated the effects of the problematic use or addiction of social media on health and well-being, 167 (72%) studied the effects of social media use as a ""normal"" behavior. "
5352,2,Most of the studies used measures assessing the time users spend using social media. 
5353,2,Most of the studies that examined the effects of problematic social media use or addiction used addiction scales. 
5354,2,"Most studies examined the association of social media use with mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and loneliness. "
5355,2,"While there are a considerable number of studies investigating physical health outcomes such as self-rated health, sleep, and sitting time or lack of physical activity, relatively a small number of studies examined social, psychological, and emotional well-being. "
5356,2,Most of the studies 183 (79%) did not use any theory.
5357,3,"Most studies conceptualized social media use as a ""normal"" behavior and mostly used time-spent measures, whereas a considerable number of studies conceptualized social media use as an addiction and used various addiction measures. "
5358,3,The studies disproportionately focused on investigating the associations of social media use with negative health and well-being outcomes. 
5359,3,"The findings suggest the need for going beyond time spent to more sophisticated measurement approaches that consider the multiplicity of activities that users perform on social media platforms and the need for more theory-based studies on the association of social media use with not only negative well-being or ""ill-being"" but also with positive health and well-being outcomes."
5360,4,"Effectiveness of a Mobile App (KhunLook) Versus the Maternal and Child Health Handbook on Thai Parents Health Literacy, Accuracy of Health Assessments, and Convenience of Use: Randomized Controlled Trial"
5361,0,Children of parents who have higher health literacy (HL) benefit more from preventive child health care. 
5362,0,Digital interventions have been used to improve parents' HL with high satisfaction. 
5363,0,KhunLook is a Thai mobile app conceived using strategies to improve HL. 
5364,0,It was developed to assist parents in assessing and keeping track of their child's health in complement to the standard Maternal and Child Health Handbook (MCHH).
5365,1,"Parents of children under 3 years of age who (1) had a smartphone or tablet and the MCHH and (2) could participate in 2 visits, 2-6 months apart at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand, were enrolled in this 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial between April 2020 and May 2021. "
5366,1,Parents were randomized 1:1 to 2 groups. 
5367,1,"At visit 1, data on demographics and baseline HL (Thailand Health Literacy Scales) were collected. "
5368,1,"Parents in the app group used the KhunLook app and the control group used their child's handbook to assess their child's growth, development, nutrition and feeding, immunization status and rated the convenience of the tool they used. "
5369,1,"At visit 2, they repeated the assessments and completed the HL questionnaire."
5370,2,"A total of 358 parents completed the study (358/408, 87.7%). "
5371,2,"After the intervention, the number of parents with high total HL significantly increased from 94/182 (51.6%) to 109/182 (59.9%; 15/182; Delta 8.2%; P=.04), specifically in the health management (30/182; Delta 16.4%; P<.001) and child health management (18/182; Delta 9.9%; P=.01) domains in the app group, but not in the control group. "
5372,2,"Parents in the app group could correctly assess their child's head circumference (172/182, 94.5% vs 124/176, 70.5%; P<.001) and development (173/182, 95.1% vs 139/176, 79.0%; P<.001) better than those in the control group at both visits. "
5373,2,"A higher proportion of parents in the app group rated their tool as very easy or easy to use (174-181/182, 95.6%-99.5% vs 141-166/176, 80.1%-94.3%; P<.001) on every item since the first visit."
5374,3,"Our results suggest the potential of a smartphone app (KhunLook) to improve parents' HL as well as to promote superior accuracy of parents' assessment of their child's head circumference and development, with a similar effect on weight, height, nutrition and feeding, and immunization as in traditional interventions. "
5375,3,Using the KhunLook app is useful and more convenient for parents in promoting a healthy child preventive care during early childhood.
5376,4,Acceptance and Privacy Perceptions Toward Video-based Active and Assisted Living Technologies: Scoping Review
5377,0,The aging society posits new socioeconomic challenges to which a potential solution is active and assisted living (AAL) technologies. 
5378,0,"Visual-based sensing systems are technologically among the most advantageous forms of AAL technologies in providing health and social care; however, they come at the risk of violating rights to privacy. "
5379,0,"With the immersion of video-based technologies, privacy-preserving smart solutions are being developed; however, the user acceptance research about these developments is not yet being systematized."
5380,1,A total of 22 studies were identified with a primary focus on user acceptance and privacy attitudes during a literature search of major databases. 
5381,1,Methodological quality assessment and thematic analysis of the selected studies were executed and principal findings are summarized. 
5382,1,The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines were followed at every step of this scoping review.
5383,2,"Acceptance attitudes toward video-based AAL technologies are rather conditional, and are summarized into five main themes seen from the two end-user perspectives: caregiver and care receiver. "
5384,2,"With privacy being a major barrier to video-based AAL technologies, security and medical safety were identified as the major benefits across the studies."
5385,3,This review reveals a very low methodological quality of the empirical studies assessing user acceptance of video-based AAL technologies. 
5386,3,We propose that more specific and more end user- and real life-targeting research is needed to assess the acceptance of proposed solutions.
5387,4,The Efficacy and Usability of an Unguided Web-Based Grief Intervention for Adults Who Lost a Loved One During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Randomized Controlled Trial
5388,0,The death of a loved one was a challenge many people faced during the COVID-19 pandemic within the context of extraordinary circumstances and great uncertainty. 
5389,0,"Grief is an unavoidable part of life, and for most people, feelings of grief decrease naturally over time. "
5390,0,"However, for some people, grieving can become a particularly painful process with clinical symptoms that may require professional help to resolve. "
5391,0,"To provide psychological support to people who had lost a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic, an unguided web-based psychological intervention was developed."
5392,1,We used a randomized controlled trial with an intervention group (IG) and a waitlist control group (CG). 
5393,1,"The groups were assessed 3 times (before beginning the intervention, upon completing the intervention, and 3 months after the intervention). "
5394,1,The intervention was delivered on the web in an asynchronous format through the Duelo COVID web page. 
5395,1,"Participants created an account that could be used on their computers, smartphones, or tablets. "
5396,1,The evaluation process was automated as part of the intervention.
5397,2,"A total of 114 participants were randomly assigned to the IG or CG and met criteria for inclusion in the study (n=45, 39.5% completed the intervention and n=69, 60.5% completed the waitlist period). "
5398,2,"Most participants (103/114, 90.4%) were women. "
5399,2,"The results indicated that the treatment significantly reduced baseline clinical symptoms in the IG for all variables (P<.001 to P=.006), with larger effect sizes for depression, hopelessness, grief, anxiety, and risk of suicide (all effect sizes =0.5). "
5400,2,The follow-up evaluation showed that symptom reduction was maintained at 3 months after the intervention. 
5401,2,"The results from the CG showed that participants experienced significantly decreased levels of hopelessness after completing the time on the waitlist (P<.001), but their suicidal risk scores increased. "
5402,2,"Regarding the usability of the self-applied intervention system, the results indicated a high level of satisfaction with the Grief COVID."
5403,3,"The self-applied web-based intervention Grief COVID was effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, hopelessness, risk of suicide risk, posttraumatic stress disorder, and complicated grief disorder. "
5404,3,"Grief COVID was evaluated by the participants, who reported that the system was easy to use. "
5405,3,These results affirm the importance of developing additional web-based psychological tools to help reduce clinical symptoms in people experiencing grief because of the loss of a loved one during a pandemic.
5406,4,Lessons for Vietnam on the Use of Digital Technologies to Support Patient-Centered Care in Low- and Middle-Income Countries in the Asia-Pacific Region: Scoping Review
5407,0,"A rapidly aging population, a shifting disease burden and the ongoing threat of infectious disease outbreaks pose major concerns for Vietnam's health care system. "
5408,0,"Health disparities are evident in many parts of the country, especially in rural areas, and the population faces inequitable access to patient-centered health care. "
5409,0,"Vietnam must therefore explore and implement advanced solutions to the provision of patient-centered care, with a view to reducing pressures on the health care system simultaneously. "
5410,0,The use of digital health technologies (DHTs) may be one of these solutions.
5411,1,A scoping review was undertaken. 
5412,1,Systematic searches of 7 databases were conducted in January 2022 to identify publications on DHTs and patient-centered care in the APR. 
5413,1,"Thematic analysis was conducted, and DHTs were classified using the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence evidence standards framework for DHTs (tiers A, B, and C). "
5414,1,Reporting was in line with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines.
5415,2,"Of the 264 publications identified, 45 (17%) met the inclusion criteria. "
5416,2,"The majority of the DHTs were classified as tier C (15/33, 45%), followed by tier B (14/33, 42%) and tier A (4/33, 12%). "
5417,2,"At an individual level, DHTs increased accessibility of health care and health-related information, supported individuals in self-management, and led to improvements in clinical and quality-of-life outcomes. "
5418,2,"At a systems level, DHTs supported patient-centered outcomes by increasing efficiency, reducing strain on health care resources, and supporting patient-centered clinical practice. "
5419,2,"The most frequently reported enablers for the use of DHTs for patient-centered care included alignment of DHTs with users' individual needs, ease of use, availability of direct support from health care professionals, provision of technical support as well as user education and training, appropriate governance of privacy and security, and cross-sectorial collaboration. "
5420,2,"Common barriers included low user literacy and digital literacy, limited user access to DHT infrastructure, and a lack of policies and protocols to guide the implementation and use of DHTs."
5421,3,"The use of DHTs is a viable option to increase equitable access to quality, patient-centered care across Vietnam and simultaneously reduce pressures on the health care system. "
5422,3,Vietnam can take advantage of the lessons learned by other lowand middle-income countries in the APR when developing a national road map to digital health transformation. 
5423,3,"Recommendations that Vietnamese policy makers may consider include emphasizing stakeholder engagement, strengthening digital literacy, supporting the improvement of DHT infrastructure, increasing cross-sectorial collaboration, strengthening governance of cybersecurity, and leading the way in DHT uptake."

5436,4,Effectiveness of Digital Guided Self-help Mindfulness Training During Pregnancy on Maternal Psychological Distress and Infant Neuropsychological Development: Randomized Controlled Trial
5437,0,Maternal psychological distress during pregnancy is associated with unfavorable outcomes in infants. 
5438,0,"Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can effectively alleviate psychological distress, but there are often barriers to the access of face-to-face interventions."
5439,1,This was a randomized controlled trial. 
5440,1,We recruited 160 women who were 12 to 20 weeks pregnant and exhibited psychological distress. 
5441,1,We randomized them into a digital GSH-MBI group and a control group (usual perinatal care). 
5442,1,"The digital GSH-MBI consisted of a 6-week intervention through a WeChat mini program, with a daily reminder sent to the participants by a research assistant via WeChat. "
5443,1,"The primary outcomes consisted of maternal psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms, which were assessed at 6 time points from baseline to 6 months post partum (only pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms were assessed 3 times during pregnancy). "
5444,1,"The secondary outcomes were infant neuropsychological outcomes, including temperament and developmental behaviors, which were assessed at 6 weeks and 6 months post partum."
5445,2,"Compared with the control group, the digital GSH-MBI group showed a significant reduction in depression, anxiety, and pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms. "
5446,2,"In addition, the scores of the digital GSH-MBI group were lower than those of the control group for the 3 types of infant temperament at 6 weeks post partum, including quality of mood, distractibility, and adaptability."
5447,3,Digital GSH-MBIs are effective in alleviating psychological distress among pregnant women and protecting infant outcomes.
5448,4,Digital Health Applications to Establish a Remote Diagnosis of Orthopedic Knee Disorders: Scoping Review
5449,0,"Knee pain is highly prevalent worldwide, and this number is expected to rise in the future. "
5450,0,"The COVID-19 outbreak, in combination with the aging population, rising health care costs, and the need to make health care more accessible worldwide, has led to an increasing demand for digital health care applications to deliver care for patients with musculoskeletal conditions. "
5451,0,Digital health and other forms of telemedicine can add value in optimizing health care for patients and health care providers. 
5452,0,This might reduce health care costs and make health care more accessible while maintaining a high level of quality. 
5453,0,"Although expectations are high, there is currently no overview comparing digital health applications with face-to-face contact in clinical trials to establish a primary knee diagnosis in orthopedic surgery."
5454,1,A scoping review was conducted using the PubMed and Embase databases according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) statement. 
5455,1,The inclusion criteria were studies reporting methods to determine a primary knee diagnosis in orthopedic surgery using digital health or telemedicine. 
5456,1,"On April 28 and 29, 2021, searches were conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE) and Embase. "
5457,1,"Data charting was conducted using a predefined form and included details on general study information, study population, type of application, comparator, analyses, and key findings. "
5458,1,A risk-of-bias analysis was not deemed relevant considering the scoping review design of the study.
5459,2,"After screening 5639 articles, 7 (0.12%) were included. "
5460,2,"In total, 2 categories to determine a primary diagnosis were identified: screening studies (4/7, 57%) and decision support studies (3/7, 43%). "
5461,2,"There was great heterogeneity in the included studies in algorithms used, disorders, input parameters, and outcome measurements. "
5462,2,No more than 25 knee disorders were included in the studies. 
5463,2,The included studies showed a relatively high sensitivity (67%-91%). 
5464,2,"The accuracy of the different studies was generally lower, with a specificity of 27% to 48% for decision support studies and 73% to 96% for screening studies."
5465,3,This scoping review shows that there are a limited number of available applications to establish a remote diagnosis of knee disorders in orthopedic surgery. 
5466,3,"To date, there is limited evidence that digital health applications can assist patients or orthopedic surgeons in establishing the primary diagnosis of knee disorders. "
5467,3,"Future research should aim to integrate multiple sources of information and a standardized study design with close collaboration among clinicians, data scientists, data managers, lawyers, and service users to create reliable and secure databases."
5468,4,The Effect of an eHealth Coaching Program (Smarter Pregnancy) on Attitudes and Practices Toward Periconception Lifestyle Behaviors in Women Attempting Pregnancy: Prospective Study
5469,0,Lifestyle behaviors during the periconception period contribute to achievement of a successful pregnancy. 
5470,0,Assessment of attitudes and practices toward these modifiable behaviors can aid in identifying gaps in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors with impact on intervention effectiveness.
5471,1,Women attempting pregnancy through ART (n=1060) or natural conception (n=631) were selected during the periconception period. 
5472,1,"The intervention groups, conceived through ART or naturally, received Smarter Pregnancy coaching for 24 weeks, whereas the control group conceived through ART and did not receive coaching. "
5473,1,Attitudes and practices at baseline and follow-up periods were obtained from self-administered online questionnaire provided by the program. 
5474,1,Attitudes were assessed in women with unhealthy behaviors as their intention to increase their fruit and vegetable intake and to quit smoking using a yes/no question. 
5475,1,"Outcomes on practices, suggesting effectiveness, included daily fruit (pieces) and vegetable (grams) intake, and if women smoked (yes/no). "
5476,1,"Changes in attitudes and practices were compared at 12 and 24 weeks with baseline between the ART intervention and ART control groups, and within the intervention groups between ART and natural conception. "
5477,1,Changes in practices at 12 and 24 weeks were also compared with baseline between women with negative attitude and positive attitude within the intervention groups: ART and natural conception. 
5478,1,Analysis was performed using linear and logistic regression models adjusted for maternal confounders and baseline attitudes and practices.
5479,2,"The ART intervention group showed higher vegetable intake and lower odds for negative attitudes toward vegetable intake after 12 weeks (beta(adj)=25.72 g, P<.001; adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] 0.24, P<.001) and 24 weeks of coaching (beta(adj)=23.84 g, P<.001; ORadj 0.28, P<.001) compared with ART controls. "
5480,2,"No statistically significant effect was observed on attitudes and practices toward fruit intake (12 weeks: P=.16 and .08, respectively; 24 weeks: P=.16 and .08, respectively) and smoking behavior (12 weeks: P=.87; 24 weeks: P=.92). "
5481,2,No difference was observed for the studied attitudes and practices between the ART intervention and natural conception intervention groups. 
5482,2,"Women with persistent negative attitude toward fruit and vegetable intake at week 12 showed lower fruit and vegetable intake at week 24 compared with women with positive attitude (beta(adj)=-.49, P<.001; beta(adj)=-30.07, P<.001, respectively)."
5483,3,The eHealth Smarter Pregnancy program may improve vegetable intake-related attitudes and practices in women undergoing ART treatment. 
5484,3,Women with no intention to increase fruit and vegetable intake had less improvement in their intakes. 
5485,3,"Despite small changes, this study demonstrates again that Smarter Pregnancy can be used to improve vegetable intake, which can complemented by blended care that combines face-to-face and online care to also improve fruit intake and smoking behavior."
5486,4,Financial and Clinical Impact of Virtual Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Difference-in-Differences Analysis
5487,0,Virtual care (VC) and remote patient monitoring programs were deployed widely during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
5488,0,"Deployments were heterogeneous and evolved as the pandemic progressed, complicating subsequent attempts to quantify their impact. "
5489,0,The unique arrangement of the US Military Health System (MHS) enabled direct comparison between facilities that did and did not implement a standardized VC program. 
5490,0,The VC program enrolled patients symptomatic for COVID-19 or at risk for severe disease. 
5491,0,Patients' vital signs were continuously monitored at home with a wearable device (Current Health). 
5492,0,A central team monitored vital signs and conducted daily or twice-daily reviews (the nurse-to-patient ratio was 1:30).
5493,1,This was a retrospective difference-in-differences (DiD) evaluation that compared 8 military treatment facilities (MTFs) with and 39 MTFs without a VC program. 
5494,1,Tricare Prime beneficiaries diagnosed with COVID-19 (Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group 177 or International Classification of Diseases-10 codes U07.1/07.2) who were eligible for care within the MHS and aged 21 years and or older between December 2020 and December 2021 were included. 
5495,1,"Primary outcomes were length of stay and associated cost savings; secondary outcomes were escalation to physical care from home, 30-day readmissions after VC discharge, adherence to the wearable, and alarms per patient-day."
5496,2,A total of 1838 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to an MTF with a VC program of 3988 admitted to the MHS. 
5497,2,"Of these patients, 237 (13%) were enrolled in the VC program. "
5498,2,"The DiD analysis indicated that centers with the program had a 12% lower length of stay averaged across all COVID-19 patients, saving US $2047 per patient. "
5499,2,"The total cost of equipping, establishing, and staffing the VC program was estimated at US $3816 per day. "
5500,2,Total net savings were estimated at US $2.3 million in the first year of the program across the MHS. 
5501,2,"The wearables were activated by 231 patients (97.5%) and were monitored through the Current Health platform for a total of 3474 (median 7.9, range 3.2-16.5) days. "
5502,2,Wearable adherence was 85% (IQR 63%-94%). 
5503,2,Patients triggered a median of 1.6 (IQR 0.7-5.2) vital sign alarms per patient per day; 203 (85.7%) were monitored at home and then directly discharged from VC; 27 (11.4%) were escalated to a physical hospital bed as part of their initial admission. 
5504,2,There were no increases in 30-day readmissions or emergency department visits.
5505,3,Monitored patients were adherent to the wearable device and triggered a manageable number of alarms/day for the monitoring-team-to-patient ratio. 
5506,3,"Despite only enrolling 13% of COVID-19 patients at centers where it was available, the program offered substantial savings averaged across all patients in those centers without adversely affecting clinical outcomes."

5509,0,"During their treatment trajectory, couples express high information and communication needs. "
5510,0,They appreciate using the internet to obtain fertility-related information. 
5511,0,"In a previous study, we developed myFertiCare, an eHealth tool providing personalized information and interactive functionalities for infertile couples in order to improve patient-centered care. "
5512,0,The app has already been successful in qualitative evaluations of usability.
5513,1,"A quantitative study was performed based on the HOT-fit framework using validated questionnaires focusing on the human, organizational, and technology domains. "
5514,1,Questions were added on the effect of using myFertiCare on couples'knowledge about infertility and treatment. 
5515,1,"Questions regarding the burden of infertility, the burden of infertility treatment, and the experience of patient-centeredness were based on the main items of the validated fertility quality of life (FertiQoL) and Patient-Centredness Questionnaire-Infertility questionnaires, respectively. "
5516,1,"Also, nonusers of the app were included to explore motivations for not using the app and identify opportunities for improvement. "
5517,1,"Finally, user data were analyzed to provide insight into multiple variables concerning app use."
5518,2,"In the human and technology domains, myFertiCare showed good system usability, high user satisfaction, and high information and interface quality. "
5519,2,"In the organizational domain, implementation was considered to be sufficient by both patients and staff. "
5520,2,"Use of the app increased knowledge about the treatment, improved coping with the treatment, and enhanced the experience of patient-centeredness. "
5521,2,User data showed that women were the main app users and that use of the app gradually declined during the treatment trajectory.
5522,3,"A multi-faceted online app, myFertiCare, has been successfully evaluated quantitatively for implementation by using the HOT-fit framework. "
5523,3,"Use of the app increased knowledge about the treatment, improved coping with the treatment, and enhanced the experience of patient-centeredness. "

5526,4,"Characteristics and Health Care Use of Patients Attending Virtual Walk-in Clinics in Ontario, Canada: Cross-sectional Analysis"
5527,0,Funding changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic supported the growth of direct-to-consumer virtual walk-in clinics in several countries. 
5528,0,Little is known about patients who attend virtual walk-in clinics or how these clinics contribute to care continuity and subsequent health care use.
5529,1,"This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study in Ontario, Canada. "
5530,1,"Patients who had received a family physician visit at 1 of 13 selected virtual walk-in clinics from April 1 to December 31, 2020, were compared to Ontario residents who had any virtual family physician visit. "
5531,1,The main outcome was postvisit health care use.
5532,2,"Virtual walk-in patients (n=132,168) had fewer comorbidities and lower previous health care use than Ontarians with any virtual family physician visit. "
5533,2,"Virtual walk-in patients were also less likely to have a subsequent in-person visit with the same physician (309/132,168, 0.2% vs 704,759/6,412,304, 11%; standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.48), more likely to have a subsequent virtual visit (40,030/132,168, 30.3% vs 1,403,778/6,412,304, 21.9%; SMD 0.19), and twice as likely to have an emergency department visit within 30 days (11,003/132,168, 8.3% vs 262,509/6,412,304, 4.1%; SMD 0.18), an effect that persisted after adjustment and across urban/rural resident groups."
5534,3,"Compared to Ontarians attending any family physician virtual visit, virtual walk-in patients were less likely to have a subsequent in-person physician visit and were more likely to visit the emergency department. "
5535,3,These findings will inform policy makers aiming to ensure the integration of virtual visits with longitudinal primary care.
5536,4,Evolution of Public Opinion on COVID-19 Vaccination in Japan: Large-Scale Twitter Data Analysis
5537,0,Vaccines are promising tools to control the spread of COVID-19. 
5538,0,"An effective vaccination campaign requires government policies and community engagement, sharing experiences for social support, and voicing concerns about vaccine safety and efficiency. "
5539,0,The increasing use of online social platforms allows us to trace large-scale communication and infer public opinion in real time.
5540,1,"We collected more than 100 million vaccine-related tweets written in Japanese and posted by 8 million users (approximately 6.4% of the Japanese population) from January 1 to October 31, 2021. "
5541,1,We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation to perform automated topic modeling of tweet text during the vaccination campaign. 
5542,1,"In addition, we performed an interrupted time series regression analysis to evaluate the impact of 4 critical social events on public opinion."
5543,2,"We identified 15 topics grouped into the following 4 themes: (1) personal issue, (2) breaking news, (3) politics, and (4) conspiracy and humor. "
5544,2,"The evolution of the popularity of themes revealed a shift in public opinion, with initial sharing of attention over personal issues (individual aspect), collecting information from news (knowledge acquisition), and government criticism to focusing on personal issues. "
5545,2,Our analysis showed that the Tokyo Olympic Games affected public opinion more than other critical events but not the course of vaccination. 
5546,2,Public opinion about politics was significantly affected by various social
5547,3,"This study showed a striking shift in public interest in Japan, with users splitting their attention over various themes early in the vaccination campaign and then focusing only on personal issues, as trust in vaccines and policies increased. "
5548,3,"An interrupted time series regression analysis showed that the vaccination rollout to the general population (under 65 years) increased the popularity of tweets about practical advice and personal vaccination experience, and the Tokyo Olympic Games disrupted public opinion but not the course of the vaccination campaign. "
5549,3,"The methodology developed here allowed us to monitor the evolution of public opinion and evaluate the impact of social events on public opinion, using large-scale Twitter data."
5550,4,User Experience of COVID-19 Chatbots: Scoping Review
5551,0,The COVID-19 pandemic has had global impacts and caused some health systems to experience substantial pressure. 
5552,0,The need for accurate health information has been felt widely. 
5553,0,"Chatbots have great potential to reach people with authoritative information, and a number of chatbots have been quickly developed to disseminate information about COVID-19. "
5554,0,"However, little is known about user experiences of and perspectives on these tools."
5555,1,"A scoping review was carried out in June 2021 using keywords to cover the literature concerning chatbots, user engagement, and COVID-19. "
5556,1,"The search strategy included databases covering health, communication, marketing, and the COVID-19 pandemic specifically, including MEDLINE Ovid, Embase, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, Emerald, and EBSCO. "
5557,1,"Studies that assessed the design, marketing, and user features of COVID-19 chatbots or those that explored user perspectives and experience were included. "
5558,1,"We excluded papers that were not related to COVID-19; did not include any reporting on user perspectives, experience, or the general use of chatbot features or marketing; or where a version was not available in English. "
5559,1,"The authors independently screened results for inclusion, using both backward and forward citation checking of the included papers."
5560,2,"A total of 517 papers were sourced from the literature, and 10 were included in the final review. "
5561,2,"Our scoping review identified a number of factors impacting adoption and engagement including content, trust, digital ability, and acceptability. "
5562,2,"The papers included discussions about chatbots developed for COVID-19 screening and general COVID-19 information, as well as studies investigating user perceptions and opinions on COVID-19 chatbots."
5563,3,The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique and specific challenge for digital health interventions. 
5564,3,Design and implementation were required at a rapid speed as digital health service adoption accelerated globally. 
5565,3,Chatbots for COVID-19 have been developed quickly as the pandemic has challenged health systems. 
5566,3,There is a need for more comprehensive and routine reporting of factors impacting adoption and engagement. 
5567,3,This paper has shown both the potential of chatbots to reach users in an emergency and the need to better understand how users engage and what they want.
5568,4,Changes in a Digital Type 2 Diabetes Self-management Intervention During National Rollout: Mixed Methods Study of Fidelity
5569,0,"""Healthy Living for People with type 2 Diabetes (HeLP-Diabetes)"" was a theory-based digital self-management intervention for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus that encouraged behavior change using behavior change techniques (BCTs) and promoted self-management. "
5570,0,HeLP-Diabetes was effective in reducing HbA1c levels in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). 
5571,0,"National Health Service (NHS) England commissioned a national rollout of HeLP-Diabetes in routine care (now called ""Healthy Living""). "
5572,0,Healthy Living presents a unique opportunity to examine the fidelity of the national rollout of an intervention originally tested in an RCT.
5573,1,"Content analysis of Healthy Living was conducted using 3 coding frameworks (objective 1): the BCT Taxonomy v1, a new coding framework for assessing self-management tasks, and the Template for Intervention Description and Replication. "
5574,1,The extent to which BCTs and self-management tasks were included in Healthy Living was compared with published descriptions of HeLP-Diabetes (objective 2). 
5575,1,Semistructured interviews were conducted with 9 stakeholders involved in the development of HeLP-Diabetes or Healthy Living to understand the reasons for any changes during national rollout (objective 3). 
5576,1,Qualitative data were thematically analyzed using a modified framework approach.
5577,2,The content analysis identified 43 BCTs in Healthy Living. 
5578,2,"Healthy Living included all but one of the self-regulatory BCTs (""commitment"") in the original HeLP-Diabetes intervention. "
5579,2,"Healthy Living was found to address all areas of self-management (medical, emotional, and role) in line with the original HeLP-Diabetes intervention. "
5580,2,"However, 2 important changes were identified. "
5581,2,"First, facilitated access by a health care professional was not implemented; interviews revealed this was because general practices had fewer resources in comparison with the RCT. "
5582,2,"Second, Healthy Living included an additional structured web-based learning curriculum that was developed by the HeLP-Diabetes team but was not included in the original RCT; interviews revealed that this was because of changes in NHS policy that encouraged referral to structured education. "
5583,2,Interviewees described how the service provider had to reformat the content of the original HeLP-Diabetes website to make it more usable and accessible to meet the multiple digital standards required for implementation in the NHS.
5584,3,The national rollout of Healthy Living had good fidelity to the BCT and self-management content of HeLP-Diabetes. 
5585,3,"Important changes were attributable to the challenges of scaling up a digital intervention from an RCT to a nationally implemented intervention, mainly because of fewer resources available in practice and the length of time since the RCT. "
5586,3,This study highlights the importance of considering implementation throughout all phases of intervention development.
5587,4,The Development of a Novel mHealth Tool for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Tracking Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Adherence as a Percentage of Time in Bed
5588,0,"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the mainstay obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment; however, poor adherence to CPAP is common. "
5589,0,Current guidelines specify 4 hours of CPAP use per night as a target to define adequate treatment adherence. 
5590,0,"However, effective OSA treatment requires CPAP use during the entire time spent in bed to optimally treat respiratory events and prevent adverse health effects associated with the time spent sleeping without wearing a CPAP device. "
5591,0,"Nightly sleep patterns vary considerably, making it necessary to measure CPAP adherence relative to the time spent in bed. "
5592,0,Weight loss is an important goal for patients with OSA. 
5593,0,Tools are required to address these clinical challenges in patients with OSA.
5594,1,"We used an iterative, user-centered process to design a new CPAP adherence tracking module that integrated with an existing weight loss app. "
5595,1,A total of 37 patients with OSA aged 20 to 65 years were recruited. 
5596,1,"In phase 1, patients with OSA who were receiving CPAP treatment (n=7) tested the weight loss app to track nutrition, activity, and weight for 10 days. "
5597,1,Participants completed a usability and acceptability survey. 
5598,1,"In phase 2, patients with OSA who were receiving CPAP treatment (n=21) completed a web-based survey about their interpretations and preferences for wireframes of the CPAP tracking module. "
5599,1,"In phase 3, patients with recently diagnosed OSA who were CPAP naive (n=9) were prescribed a CPAP device (ResMed AirSense-10 AutoSet) and tested the integrated app for 3 to 4 weeks. "
5600,1,Participants completed a usability survey and provided feedback.
5601,2,"During phase 1, participants found the app to be mostly easy to use, except for some difficulty searching for specific foods. "
5602,2,All participants found the connected devices (Fitbit activity tracker and Fitbit Aria scale) easy to use and helpful. 
5603,2,"During phase 2, participants correctly interpreted CPAP adherence success, expressed as percentage of wear time relative to time spent in bed, and preferred seeing a clearly stated percentage goal (""Goal: 100%""). "
5604,2,"In phase 3, participants found the integrated app easy to use and requested push notification reminders to wear CPAP before bedtime and to sync Fitbit in the morning."
5605,3,We developed a mobile health tool that integrated a new CPAP adherence tracking module into an existing weight loss app. 
5606,3,"Novel features included addressing OSA-obesity comorbidity, CPAP adherence tracking via percentage of CPAP wear time relative to objectively assessed time spent in bed, and push notifications to foster adherence. "
5607,3,Future research on the effectiveness of this tool in improving OSA treatment adherence is warranted.
5608,4,A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of a Mobile Phone-Based Integrated HIV-Prevention Intervention Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in China: Economic Evaluation
5609,0,Mobile phone-based digital interventions have been shown to be a promising strategy for HIV prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM).
5610,1,"The cost-effectiveness of the mobile phone-based digital intervention was estimated for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 HIV-negative MSM who were followed for 1 year. "
5611,1,A model was developed with China-specific data to project the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of two mobile phone-based digital strategies for HIV prevention among MSM. 
5612,1,"The intervention group received an integrated behavioral intervention that included 1) individualized HIV infection risk assessment, 2) recommendation of centers testing for HIV and other STIs, 3) free online order of condoms and HIV and syphilis self-test kits and 4) educational materials about HIV/AIDS. "
5613,1,The control group was only given educational materials about HIV/AIDS. 
5614,1,"Outcomes of interest were the number of HIV infections among MSM averted by the intervention, intervention costs, cost per HIV infection averted by the mobile phone-based digital intervention, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). "
5615,1,Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were also conducted to examine the robustness of the results.
5616,2,It is estimated that the intervention can prevent 48 MSM from becoming infected with HIV and can save 480 QALYs. 
5617,2,"The cost of preventing 1 case of HIV infection was US $2599.87, and the cost-utility ratio was less than 0. "
5618,2,Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of the mobile phone-based digital intervention was mainly impacted by the average number of sexual behaviors with each sexual partner. 
5619,2,"Additionally, the higher the HIV prevalence among MSM, the greater the benefit of the intervention."
5620,3,Mobile phone-based digital interventions are a cost-effective HIV-prevention strategy for MSM and could be considered for promotion and application among high-risk MSM subgroups.
5621,4,Racial and Ethnic Differences in Outcomes of a 12-Week Digital Rehabilitation Program for Musculoskeletal Pain: Prospective Longitudinal Cohort Study
5622,0,Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain disproportionately affects people from different ethnic backgrounds through higher burden and less access to care. 
5623,0,Digital care programs (DCPs) can improve access and help reduce inequities. 
5624,0,"However, the outcomes of such programs based on race and ethnicity have yet to be studied."
5625,1,This was an ad hoc analysis of an ongoing decentralized single-arm investigation into engagement and clinical-related outcomes after a multimodal DCP in patients with MSK conditions. 
5626,1,"Patients were stratified by self-reported racial and ethnic group, and their engagement and outcome changes between baseline and 12 weeks were compared using latent growth curve analysis. "
5627,1,"Outcomes included program engagement (number of sessions), self-reported pain scores, likelihood of surgery, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment. "
5628,1,"A minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 30% was calculated for pain, and multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate race as an independent predictor of meeting the MCID."
5629,2,"A total of 6949 patients completed the program: 65.5% (4554/6949) of them were non-Hispanic White, 10.8% (749/6949) were Black, 9.7% (673/6949) were Asian, 9.2% (636/6949) were Hispanic, and 4.8% (337/6949) were of other racial or ethnic backgrounds. "
5630,2,The population studied was diverse and followed the proportions of the US population. 
5631,2,"All groups reported high engagement and satisfaction, with Hispanic and Black patients ranking first among satisfaction despite lower engagement. "
5632,2,"Black patients had a higher likelihood to drop out (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.40, P=.04) than non-Hispanic White patients. "
5633,2,"Hispanic and Black patients reported the highest level of pain, surgical intent, work productivity, and impairment in activities of daily living at baseline. "
5634,2,"All race groups showed a significant improvement in all outcomes, with Black and Hispanic patients reporting the greatest improvements in clinical outcomes. "
5635,2,"Hispanic patients also had the highest response rate for pain (75.8%) and a higher OR of meeting the pain MCID (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.24-2.45, P=.001), when compared with non-Hispanic White patients, independent of age, BMI, sex, therapy type, education level, and employment status. "
5636,2,No differences in mental health outcomes were found between race and ethnic groups.
5637,3,This study advocates for the utility of a DCP in improving access to MSK care and promoting health equity. 
5638,3,Engagement and satisfaction rates were high in all the groups. 
5639,3,"Black and Hispanic patients had higher MSK burden at baseline and lower engagement but also reported higher improvements, with Hispanic patients presenting a higher likelihood of pain improvement."

5641,0,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects millions of people worldwide, and a core component of management of the condition is self-management. "
5642,0,The internet is an important source of health information for many people. 
5643,0,"However, the content of websites regarding treatment recommendations for PAD has not been fully evaluated."
5644,1,"A review of websites from hospitals, universities, governments, consumer organizations, and professional associations in the United States and the United Kingdom was conducted. "
5645,1,Website recommendations for the treatment of PAD and IC were coded in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the American Heart Association (AHA). 
5646,1,"Primary outcomes were website credibility (4-item Journal of the American Medical Association benchmark), website accuracy (in terms of the percentage of accurate recommendations), and comprehensiveness of website recommendations (in terms of the percentage of guideline recommendations that were appropriately covered). "
5647,1,Secondary outcomes were readability (Flesch-Kincaid grade level) and website quality (Health On the Net Foundation's code of conduct).
5648,2,"After screening, 62 websites were included in this analysis. "
5649,2,Only 45% (28/62) of websites met the credibility requirement by stating they were updated after the NICE guidelines were published. 
5650,2,Declaration of authorship and funding and the presence of reference lists were less commonly reported. 
5651,2,"Regarding accuracy, 81% (556/685) of website recommendations were deemed accurate on following NICE's and the AHA's recommendations. "
5652,2,"Comprehensiveness was low, with an average of 40% (25/62) of guideline treatment recommendations being appropriately covered by websites. "
5653,2,"In most cases, readability scores revealed that the websites were too complex for web-based consumer health information."
5654,3,"Web-based information from reputable sources about the treatment and management of PAD and IC are generally accurate but have low comprehensiveness, credibility, and readability."
5655,4,"Interactivity, Quality, and Content of Websites Promoting Health Behaviors During Infancy: 6-Year Update of the Systematic Assessment"
5656,0,"As of 2021, 89% of the Australian population are active internet users. "
5657,0,"Although the internet is widely used, there are concerns about the quality, accuracy, and credibility of health-related websites. "
5658,0,"A 2015 systematic assessment of infant feeding websites and apps available in Australia found that 61% of websites were of poor quality and readability, with minimal coverage of infant feeding topics and lack of author credibility."
5659,1,"Keywords related to infant milk feeding behaviors, solid feeding behaviors, active play, screen time, and sleep were used to identify websites targeting infant health behaviors on the Google search engine on Safari. "
5660,1,The websites were assessed by a subset of the authors using predetermined criteria between July 2021 and February 2022 and assessed for information content based on the Australian Infant Feeding Guidelines and National Physical Activity Recommendations. 
5661,1,"The Suitability Assessment of Materials, Quality Component Scoring System, the Health-Related Website Evaluation Form, and the adherence to the Health on the Net code were used to evaluate the suitability and quality of information. "
5662,1,Readability was assessed using 3 web-based readability tools.
5663,2,"Of the 450 websites screened, 66 were included based on the selection criteria and evaluated. "
5664,2,"Overall, the quality of websites was mostly adequate. "
5665,2,"Media-related sources, nongovernmental organizations, hospitals, and privately owned websites had the highest median quality scores, whereas university websites received the lowest median score (35%). "
5666,2,"The information covered within the websites was predominantly poor: 91% (60/66) of the websites received an overall score of <= 74% (mean 53%, SD 18%). "
5667,2,"The suitability of health information was mostly rated adequate for literacy demand, layout, and learning and motivation of readers. "
5668,2,"The median readability score for the websites was grade 8.5, which is higher than the government recommendations (<grade 8). "
5669,2,"Overall, 74% (49/66) of the websites obtained a poor rating for interactivity, measuring active control, 2-way communication, and synchronicity. "
5670,2,"The most common features found on websites were social media links (61/66, 92%), frequently asked questions (48/66, 73%), and videos (44/66, 67%). "
5671,2,Only 14% (9/66) of websites presented culturally responsive information.
5672,3,"Quality, content, readability, and interactivity of websites promoting health behaviors during infancy ranged between poor and adequate. "
5673,3,"Since the 2015 systematic assessment, there was a slight improvement in the quality of websites but no difference in the Suitability Assessment of Materials rating and readability of information. "
5674,3,There is a need for researchers and health care providers to leverage innovative web-based platforms to provide culturally competent evidence-based information based on government guidelines that are accessible to those with limited English proficiency.
5675,4,"Efficacy, Usability, and Acceptability of a Chatbot for Promoting COVID-19 Vaccination in Unvaccinated or Booster-Hesitant Young Adults: Pre-Post Pilot Study"
5676,0,COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe disease and death but are underused. 
5677,0,Interventions to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are paramount to reducing the burden of COVID-19.
5678,1,"In November 2021, we conducted a pre-post pilot study to evaluate ""Vac Chat, Fact Check,"" a web-based chatbot for promoting COVID-19 vaccination. "
5679,1,We conducted a web-based survey (N=290) on COVID-19 vaccination at a university in Hong Kong. 
5680,1,A subset of 46 participants who were either unvaccinated (n=22) or were vaccinated but hesitant to receive boosters (n=24) were selected and given access to the chatbot for a 7-day trial period. 
5681,1,"The chatbot provided information about COVID-19 vaccination (eg, efficacy and common side effects), debunked common myths about the vaccine, and included a decision aid for selecting vaccine platforms (inactivated and mRNA vaccines). "
5682,1,The main efficacy outcome was changes in the COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS) score (range 9-45) from preintervention (web-based survey) to postintervention (immediately posttrial). 
5683,1,Other efficacy outcomes included changes in intention to vaccinate or receive boosters and willingness to encourage others to vaccinate on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very). 
5684,1,Usability was assessed by the System Usability Scale (range 0-100). 
5685,1,Linear regression was used to examine the factors associated with COVID-19 VHS scores in all survey respondents.
5686,2,"The mean (SD) age of all survey respondents was 21.4 (6.3) years, and 61% (177/290) of respondents were female. "
5687,2,"Higher eHealth literacy (B=-0.26; P<.001) and perceived danger of COVID-19 (B=-0.17; P=.009) were associated with lower COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, adjusting for age, sex, chronic disease status, previous flu vaccination, and perceived susceptibility to COVID-19. "
5688,2,"The main efficacy outcome of COVID-19 VHS score significantly decreased from 28.6 (preintervention) to 24.5 (postintervention), with a mean difference of -4.2 (P<.001) and an effect size (Cohen d) of 0.94. "
5689,2,"The intention to vaccinate increased from 3.0 to 3.9 (P<.001) in unvaccinated participants, whereas the intention to receive boosters increased from 1.9 to 2.8 (P<.001) in booster-hesitant participants. "
5690,2,Willingness to encourage others to vaccinate increased from 2.7 to 3.0 (P=.04). 
5691,2,"At postintervention, the median (IQR) System Usability Scale score was 72.5 (65-77.5), whereas the median (IQR) recommendation score was 7 (6-8) on a scale from 0 to 10. "
5692,2,"In a post hoc 4-month follow-up, 82% (18/22) of initially unvaccinated participants reported having received the COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 29% (7/24) of booster-hesitant participants received boosters."
5693,3,"This pilot study provided initial evidence to support the efficacy, usability, and acceptability of a chatbot for promoting COVID-19 vaccination in young adults who were unvaccinated or booster-hesitant."
5694,4,An Internet-Based Education Program for Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Among Female College Students in Mainland China: Application of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model in a Cluster Randomized Trial
5695,0,Patients diagnosed with cervical cancer in the last 2 decades were mainly young females. 
5696,0,Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is the most radical way to prevent HPV infection and cervical cancer. 
5697,0,"However, most female college students in mainland China have not yet been vaccinated, and their relevant knowledge is limited. "
5698,0,Theory-based education delivered via the internet is a potentially accessible and useful way to promote HPV vaccination among this population.
5699,1,A 7-day online HPV education program for female college students in mainland China was developed using a cluster randomized trial design. 
5700,1,Recruitment and questionnaire surveys were performed online without face-to-face contact. 
5701,1,SPSS 23.0 was used for statistical analysis. 
5702,1,The chi-square test and t test were used to compare differences in qualitative and continuous variables between intervention and control groups. 
5703,1,The generalized estimating equation was used to test the effectiveness of the intervention with a consideration of the time factor.
5704,2,"Among 3867 participants, 102 had been vaccinated against HPV before the study (vaccination rate of 2.6%). "
5705,2,"A total of 3484 participants were followed up after the baseline survey, with no statistical difference in the loss rate between the intervention and control groups during the intervention and follow-up periods. "
5706,2,"At different follow-up time points, HPV-related knowledge, and the motivation, behavioral skills, and willingness regarding HPV vaccination were higher in the intervention group than in the control group. "
5707,2,"HPV-related knowledge was statistically different between the 2 groups, while the motivation, behavioral skills, and willingness regarding HPV vaccination only showed statistical differences right after the intervention, reaching a peak right after the intervention and then gradually reducing over time. "
5708,2,"Furthermore, there was no statistical difference in the HPV vaccination rate between the 2 groups."
5709,3,IMB model-based online education could be a promising way to increase the HPV vaccination rate and reduce the burden of HPV infection and cervical cancer among high-risk female college students in China.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR1900025476; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?

5711,4,Use of Social Media Data to Diagnose and Monitor Psychotic Disorders: Systematic Review
5712,0,"Schizophrenia is a disease associated with high burden, and improvement in care is necessary. "
5713,0,Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to diagnose several medical conditions as well as psychiatric disorders. 
5714,0,"However, this technology requires large amounts of data to be efficient. "
5715,0,Social media data could be used to improve diagnostic capabilities.
5716,1,"A systematic review of the literature was conducted using several databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and IEEE Xplore) using relevant keywords to search for articles published as of November 12, 2021. "
5717,1,"We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) criteria to identify, select, and critically assess the quality of the relevant studies while minimizing bias. "
5718,1,We critically analyzed the methodology of the studies to detect any bias and presented the results.
5719,2,"Among the 93 studies identified, 7 studies were included for analyses. "
5720,2,The included studies presented encouraging results. 
5721,2,"Social media data could be used in several ways to care for patients with schizophrenia, including the monitoring of patients after the first episode of psychosis. "
5722,2,"We identified several limitations in the included studies, mainly lack of access to clinical diagnostic data, small sample size, and heterogeneity in study quality. "
5723,2,"We recommend using state-of-the-art natural language processing neural networks, called language models, to model social media activity. "
5724,2,"Combined with the synthetic minority oversampling technique, language models can tackle the imbalanced data set limitation, which is a necessary constraint to train unbiased classifiers. "
5725,2,"Furthermore, language models can be easily adapted to the classification task with a procedure called ""fine-tuning."""
5726,3,The use of social media data for the diagnosis of psychotic disorders is promising. 
5727,3,"However, most of the included studies had significant biases; we therefore could not draw conclusions about accuracy in clinical situations. "
5728,3,Future studies need to use more accurate methodologies to obtain unbiased results.
5729,4,Understanding Engagement in Digital Mental Health and Well-being Programs for Women in the Perinatal Period: Systematic Review Without Meta-analysis
5730,0,"Pregnancy and the postnatal period can be a time of increased psychological distress, which can be detrimental to both the mother and the developing child. "
5731,0,Digital interventions are cost-effective and accessible tools to support positive mental health in women during the perinatal period. 
5732,0,"Although studies report efficacy, a key concern regarding web-based interventions is the lack of engagement leading to drop out, lack of participation, or reduced potential intervention benefits."
5733,1,This systematic review used the Cochrane Synthesis Without Meta-analysis reporting guidelines. 
5734,1,This study aimed to identify studies reporting DMHIs delivered during the perinatal period in women with subclinical mood symptoms. 
5735,1,"A systematic database search was used to identify relevant papers using the Ovid Platform for MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Medical Subject Headings on Demand for all English-language articles published in the past 10 years."
5736,2,"Searches generated a database of 3473 potentially eligible studies, with a final selection of 16 (0.46%) studies grouped by study design. "
5737,2,Participant engagement was evaluated using the CAPE framework and comparable variables were described. 
5738,2,All studies reported at least one engagement metric. 
5739,2,"However, the measures used were inconsistent, which may have contributed to the wide-ranging results. "
5740,2,"There was insufficient reporting for enactment (ie, participants' real-world use of intervention skills), with only 38% (6/16) of studies clearly recording longer-term practice through postintervention interviews. "
5741,2,The logic model proposes ways of conceptualizing and reporting engagement details in DMHIs more consistently in the future.
5742,3,The perinatal period is the optimal time to intervene with strength-based digital tools to build positive mental health. 
5743,3,"Despite the growing number of studies on digital interventions, few robustly explore engagement, and there is limited evidence of long-term skill use beyond the intervention period. "
5744,3,"Our results indicate variability in the reporting of both short-and long-term participant engagement behaviors, and we recommend the adoption of standardized reporting metrics in future digital interventions."
5745,4,The Effects of Internet-Based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy on Process Measures: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
5746,0,"Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is based on a psychological flexibility model that encompasses 6 processes: acceptance, cognitive defusion, self-as-context, being present, values, and committed action."
5747,1,A comprehensive search was conducted using 4 databases. 
5748,1,The quality of the included RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. 
5749,1,A random-effects or fixed-effects model was used. 
5750,1,"Subgroup analyses for each outcome were conducted according to the type of control group, use of therapist guidance, delivery modes, and use of targeted participants, when applicable."
5751,2,A total of 34 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. 
5752,2,"This meta-analysis found that iACT had a medium effect on psychological flexibility and small effects on mindfulness, valued living, and cognitive defusion at the immediate posttest. "
5753,2,"In addition, iACT had a small effect on psychological flexibility at follow-up. "
5754,2,The overall risk of bias across studies was unclear.
5755,3,"Relatively few studies have compared the effects of iACT with active control groups and measured the effects on mindfulness, valued living, and cognitive defusion. "
5756,3,"These findings support the processes of change in iACT, which mental health practitioners can use to support the use of iACT."
5757,4,Effect of a Reminder System on Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Adherence in Men Who Have Sex With Men: Prospective Cohort Study Based on WeChat Intervention
5758,0,"The efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly dependent on adherence, and one of the main reasons for poor adherence is forgetfulness. "
5759,0,"Therefore, it is important to explore how to remind users to take their medicine on time."
5760,1,"An open-label, multicenter, prospective cohort study of PrEP in HIV-negative MSM was conducted from November 2019 to June 2021. "
5761,1,Study participants who met the criteria were randomly divided into 2 groups: no-reminder group and reminder group. 
5762,1,Both groups received daily oral PrEP with follow-up every 3 months Adherence was measured on the basis of self-report and was defined as the percentage of medications taken on time. 
5763,1,Participants in the reminder group scanned a WeChat QR code and received a reminder message every day. 
5764,1,Participants in the no-reminder group took daily oral medicines without reminders. 
5765,1,The longitudinal trajectories of adherence for both groups were displayed to compare the variability in adherence at each time point. 
5766,1,"The association between the changes in adherence (no change, improvement, decline) at each time point and the use of the reminder system was analyzed by multinomial logistic regression models to further explore the effectiveness of the system."
5767,2,"A total of 716 MSM were included in the analysis, that is, 372 MSM in the no-reminder group and 344 MSM in the reminder group. "
5768,2,Adherence in the no-reminder group fluctuated between 0.75 and 0.80 and that in the reminder group gradually increased over time from 0.76 to 0.88. 
5769,2,Adherence at each time point was not statistically different between the 2 groups. 
5770,2,"Further analysis showed that an improvement in adherence in the early stage was associated with the use of the reminder system (odds ratio [OR] 1.65, 95% CI 1.01-2.70; P=.04). "
5771,2,"An improvement in average adherence compared to initial adherence was positively associated with the use of the reminder system (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.10-3.01; P=.02)."
5772,3,"The effect of the reminder system on PrEP adherence in MSM was more significant in the early stage, which is related to the increased motivation of users and the development of medicine-taking habits. "
5773,3,"The reminder system is potentially effective for early-stage medicine management, encouraging users to develop healthy medicine-taking habits and to increase their adherence."
5774,4,"Pilot Implementation of a User-Driven, Web-Based Application Designed to Improve Sexual Health Knowledge and Communication Among Young Zambians: Mixed Methods Study"
5775,0,Digital health interventions show promise in improving the uptake of HIV services among adolescents and young people aged 15 to 24 years in sub-Saharan Africa.
5776,1,We conducted a pre-post quasi-experimental evaluation of the user-driven Be in the Know Zambia (BITKZ) web application using web-based surveys and in-depth interviews (IDIs) on the phone. 
5777,1,We enrolled participants using social media advertisements. 
5778,1,Our final analysis set comprised 46.04% (749/1627) of participants in the intervention group (which received the BITKZ link) and 53.96% (878/1627) of participants in the comparison group (no intervention). 
5779,1,We collected survey data at study enrollment (baseline) and 5 weeks after the first enrollment in each group. 
5780,1,"Approximately 85% (637/749) of BITKZ users completed a user survey, of whom 9.3% (59/637) participated in IDIs. "
5781,1,We calculated the time interfacing with BITKZ using the application log files. 
5782,1,We conducted descriptive analyses to describe baseline characteristics and the user experience. 
5783,1,"At the endline, we assessed association using a t test and adjusted logistic regression for binary outcomes and ordinal regression for ordered outcomes, conditioning on age, sex, marital status, and employment status. "
5784,1,We used adjusted average treatment effects (aATE) to assess the effects of BITKZ intervention. 
5785,1,"We conducted rapid matrix analyses of IDI transcripts in Microsoft Excel, sorting the data by theme, gender, and experience rating."
5786,2,"Users rated BITKZ highly (excellent: 352/609, 57.8%; good: 218/609, 35.8%). "
5787,2,"At the endline, the intervention group had a higher level of knowledge related to condoms (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] : 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.69) and on wearing condoms correctly (aOR: 1.23, 95% CI 1.02-1.49). "
5788,2,"Those who had full-time employment had increased odds of knowing how to wear condoms correctly (aOR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.06-2.63) compared with those who reported being unemployed, as did men when compared with women (aOR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.59-2.31). "
5789,2,"Those in the intervention group were more likely to score higher for intention to test for sexually transmitted infections (STIs; aATE 0.21; P=.01) and HIV (aAIE 0.32; P=.05), as well as for resisting peer pressure (aAIE 2.64; P=.02). "
5790,2,"IDIs corroborated increased knowledge on correct condom use among men and female condoms among women, awareness of STIs and testing, and resistance to peer pressure. "
5791,2,"Interviewees provided examples of more open SRH communication with partners and peers and of considering, adopting, and influencing others to adopt healthier behaviors."
5792,3,"Despite the high baseline awareness of SRH among Zambian adolescents and young people with internet access, BITKZ provided modest gains in condom-related knowledge, resistance to peer pressure, and intention to test for STIs and HIV."
5793,4,Access to and Use of Internet and Social Media by Low-Morbidity Stroke Survivors Participating in a National Web-Based Secondary Stroke Prevention Trial: Cross-sectional Survey
5794,0,eHealth applications for stroke are a growing area of research that has yielded promising results. 
5795,0,"However, little is known about how stroke survivors engage with the internet, social media, and other digital technologies on a day-to-day basis."
5796,1,This study is a secondary analysis of data obtained during a national randomized controlled trial-Prevent 2nd Stroke. 
5797,1,"The participants were stroke survivors recruited from 2 Australian stroke registries who completed 2 telephone-administered surveys to collect data on demographics and stroke characteristics; health risk factors (diet quality, physical activity, blood pressure medication, alcohol intake, anxiety and depression, and smoking status); physical functioning; independence in activities of daily living; and questions about what technology they had access to, how often they used it, and for what purposes. "
5798,1,Participants were eligible if they had no more than a moderate level of disability (modified Rankin score 3) and had access to the internet. 
5799,1,"Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations between social media use and sociodemographics, physical function, and independence in activities of daily living as well as associations between stroke-related health risk factors and the use of the internet to search for health and medical information."
5800,2,Data from 354 participants were included in the analysis. 
5801,2,"Approximately 79.1% (280/354) of participants used the internet at least daily, 40.8% (118/289) accessed social media on their phone or tablet daily, and 46.4% (134/289) looked up health and medical information at least monthly. "
5802,2,"Women were 2.7 times more likely to use social media (adjusted odds ratio 2.65, 95% CI 1.51-4.72), and people aged >75 years were significantly less likely to use social media compared with those aged <55 years (adjusted odds ratio 0.17, 95% CI 0.07-0.44). "
5803,2,Health risk factors were not found to be associated with searching for health- or medical-related information.
5804,3,The internet appears to be a viable platform to engage with stroke survivors who may not be high-morbidity to conduct research and provide information and health interventions. 
5805,3,This is important given that they are at high risk of recurrent stroke regardless of their level of disability. 
5806,3,Exploring the technology use behaviors and the possibility of eHealth among survivors who experience higher levels of morbidity or disability because of their stroke is an area of research that warrants further study.
5807,4,"Findings and Guidelines on Provider Technology, Fatigue, and Well-being: Scoping Review"
5808,0,"Video and other technologies are reshaping the delivery of health care, yet barriers related to workflow and possible provider fatigue suggest that a thorough evaluation is needed for quality and process improvement."
5809,1,"A 6-stage scoping review of literature (from 10 databases) published from 2000 to 2020 that focused on technology, health care, and fatigue was conducted. "
5810,1,"Technologies included synchronous video, telephone, informatics systems, asynchronous wearable sensors, and mobile health devices for health care in 4 concept areas related to provider experience: behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and physical impact; workplace at the individual, clinic, hospital, and system or organizational levels; well-being, burnout, and stress; and perceptions regarding technology. "
5811,1,"Qualitative content, discourse, and framework analyses were used to thematically analyze data for developing a spectrum of health to risk of fatigue to manifestations of burnout."
5812,2,"Of the 4221 potential literature references, 202 (4.79%) were duplicates, and our review of the titles and abstracts of 4019 (95.21%) found that 3837 (90.9%) were irrelevant. "
5813,2,"A full-text review of 182 studies revealed that 12 (6.6%) studies met all the criteria related to technology, health care, and fatigue, and these studied the behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and physical impact of workflow at the individual, hospital, and system or organizational levels. "
5814,2,"Video and electronic health record use has been associated with physical eye fatigue; neck pain; stress; tiredness; and behavioral impacts related to additional effort owing to barriers, trouble with engagement, emotional wear and tear and exhaustion, cognitive inattention, effort, expecting problems, multitasking and workload, and emotional experiences (eg, anger, irritability, stress, and concern about well-being). "
5815,2,"An additional 14 studies that evaluated behavioral, emotional, and cognitive impacts without focusing on fatigue found high user ratings on data quality, accuracy, and processing but low satisfaction with clerical tasks, the effort required in work, and interruptions costing time, resulting in more errors, stress, and frustration. "
5816,2,Our qualitative analysis suggests a spectrum from health to risk and provides an outline of organizational approaches to human factors and technology in health care. 
5817,2,"Business, occupational health, human factors, and well-being literature have not studied technology fatigue and burnout; however, their findings help contextualize technology-based fatigue to suggest guidelines. "
5818,2,Few studies were found to contextually evaluate differences according to health professions and practice contexts.
5819,3,"Health care systems need to evaluate the impact of technology in accordance with the Quadruple Aim to support providers' well-being and prevent workload burden, fatigue, and burnout. "
5820,3,"Implementation and effectiveness approaches and a multilevel approach with objective measures for clinical, human factors, training, professional development, and administrative workflow are suggested. "
5821,3,"This requires institutional strategies and competencies to integrate health care quality, technology and well-being outcomes."
5822,4,"The Effect of Dissemination Pathways on Uptake and Relative Costs for a Transdiagnostic, Self-guided Internet Intervention for Reducing Depression, Anxiety, and Suicidal Ideation: Comparative Implementation Study"
5823,0,"Self-guided web-based programs are effective; however, inadequate implementation of these programs limits their potential to provide effective and low-cost treatment for common mental health problems at scale. "
5824,0,There is a lack of research examining optimal methods for the dissemination of web-based programs in the community.
5825,1,"Participants were recruited on the web, from general practices, or from community pharmacies; completed a screener for psychological distress; and were offered the 4-week FitMindKit program-a 12-module psychotherapeutic intervention. "
5826,1,"Uptake was defined as the number of participants who enrolled in the web-based program; reach was defined as the rate of uptake per exposure; and costs were calculated based on staff time, equipment, and advertising. "
5827,1,Adherence was assessed as the number of modules of FitMindKit completed by the participants.
5828,2,"Uptake comprised 1014 participants who were recruited through the 3 dissemination pathways: on the web (991/1014, 97.73%), in general practice (16/1014, 1.58%), and in pharmacy (7/1014, 0.69%). "
5829,2,Reach was highest for social media: 1 in every 50 people exposed to web-based advertising took up the intervention compared with 1 in every 441 in general practitioner clinics and 1 in every 1708 in pharmacies. 
5830,2,"The dissemination cost was US $4.87 per user on social media, US $557 per user for general practitioner clinics, and US $1272 per user for pharmacy dissemination No significant differences in adherence were observed between the conditions, whereas all pathways showed an underrepresentation of men and linguistic diversity."
5831,3,The web-based dissemination pathway was the most efficient and cost-effective for delivering a self-guided internet-based mental health program to people in the community More research is needed to identify how best to engage men and those with culturally diverse backgrounds in web-based interventions.
5832,4,Conditions for the Successful Integration of an eHealth Tool StopBlues Into Community-Based Interventions in France: Results From a Multiple Correspondence Analysis
5833,0,"For over a decade, digital health has held promise for enabling broader access to health information, education, and services for the general population at a lower cost. "
5834,0,"However, recent studies have shown mixed results leading to a certain disappointment regarding the benefits of eHealth technologies. "
5835,0,"In this context, community-based health promotion represents an interesting and efficient conceptual framework that could help increase the adoption of digital health solutions and facilitate their evaluation."
5836,1,"The study was nested within a cluster-randomized controlled trial that was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the promotion, with before and after observation (NCT03565562). "
5837,1,"Data from questionnaires, observations, and institutional sources were collected in 27 localities where SB was implemented. "
5838,1,"A multiple correspondence analysis was performed to assess the relations between context, type of implementation and promotion, and use of the tool."
5839,2,Three distinct promotion patterns emerged according to the profiles of the localities that were associated with specific SB utilization rates. 
5840,2,"From highest to lowest utilization rates, they are listed as follows: the privileged urban localities, investing in health that implemented a high-intensity and digital promotion, demonstrating a greater capacity to take ownership of the project; the urban, but less privileged localities that, in spite of having relatively little experience in health policy implementation, managed to implement a traditional and high-intensity promotion; and the rural localities, with little experience in addressing health issues, that implemented low-intensity promotion but could not overcome the challenges associated with their local context."
5841,3,These findings indicate the substantial influence of local context on the reception of digital tools. 
5842,3,"The urban and socioeconomic status profiles of the localities, along with their investment and pre-existing experience in health, appear to be critical for shaping the promotion and implementation of eHealth tools in terms of intensity and use of digital communication. "
5843,3,"The more digital channels used, the higher the utilization rates, ultimately leading to the overall success of the intervention."
5844,4,Mechanism of Impact of Big Data Resources on Medical Collaborative Networks From the Perspective of Transaction Efficiency of Medical Services: Survey Study
5845,0,The application of big data resources and the development of medical collaborative networks (MCNs) boost each other. 
5846,0,"However, MCNs are often assumed to be exogenous. "
5847,0,"How big data resources affect the emergence, development, and evolution of endogenous MCNs has not been well explained."
5848,1,This study was conducted by administering a survey questionnaire to information technology staff and medical staff from 132 medical institutions in China. 
5849,1,Data from information technology staff and medical staff were integrated. 
5850,1,Structural equation modeling was used to test the direct impact of big data resources on transaction efficiency of medical services. 
5851,1,"For those big data resources that had no direct impact, we analyzed their indirect impact."
5852,2,Sharing of diagnosis and treatment data (beta=.222; P=.03) and sharing of medical research data (beta=.289; P=.04) at the network level (as big data itself) positively directly affected the transaction efficiency of medical services. 
5853,2,Network protection of the external link systems (beta=.271; P=.008) at the level of medical institutions (as big data technology) positively directly affected the transaction efficiency of medical services. 
5854,2,"Encryption security of web-based data (as big data technology) at the level of medical institutions, medical service capacity available for external use, real-time data of diagnosis and treatment services (as big data itself) at the level of medical institutions, and policies and regulations at the network level indirectly affected the transaction efficiency through network protection of the external link systems at the level of medical institutions."
5855,3,"This study found that big data technology, big data itself, and policy at the network and organizational levels interact with, and influence, each other to form the transaction efficiency of medical services. "
5856,3,"On the basis of the theory of neoclassical economics, the study highlighted the implications of big data resources for the emergence and development of endogenous MCNs."
5857,4,Cannabis Use in Adults Who Screen Positive for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: CANreduce 2.0 Randomized Controlled Trial Subgroup Analysis
5858,0,Prevalence rates for lifetime cannabis use and cannabis use disorder are much higher in people with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder than in those without. 
5859,0,CANreduce 2.0 is an intervention that is generally effective at reducing cannabis use in cannabis misusers. 
5860,0,This self-guided web-based intervention (6-week duration) consists of modules grounded in motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy.
5861,1,We performed a secondary analysis of data from a previous study with the inclusion criterion of cannabis use at least once weekly over the last 30 days. 
5862,1,"Adults with and without attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (based on the Adult Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder Self-Report screener) who were enrolled to the active intervention arms of CANreduce 2.0 were compared regarding the number of days cannabis was used in the preceding 30 days, the cannabis use disorder identification test score (CUDIT) and the severity of dependence scale score (SDS) at baseline and the 3-month follow-up. "
5863,1,"Secondary outcomes were Generalized Anxiety Disorder score, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale score, retention, intervention adherence, and safety."
5864,2,"Both adults with (n=94) and without (n=273) positive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening reported significantly reduced frequency (reduction in consumption days: with: mean 11.53, SD 9.28, P<.001; without: mean 8.53, SD 9.4, P<.001) and severity of cannabis use (SDS: with: mean 3.57, SD 3.65, P<.001; without: mean 2.47, SD 3.39, P<.001; CUDIT: with: mean 6.38, SD 5.96, P<.001; without: mean 5.33, SD 6.05, P<.001), as well as anxiety (with: mean 4.31, SD 4.71, P<.001; without: mean 1.84, SD 4.22, P<.001) and depression (with: mean 10.25, SD 10.54; without: mean 4.39, SD 10.22, P<.001). "
5865,2,"Those who screened positive for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder also reported significantly decreased attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder scores (mean 4.65, SD 4.44, P<.001). "
5866,2,"There were no significant differences in change in use (P=.08), dependence (P=.95), use disorder (P=.85), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder status (P=.84), depression (P=.84), or anxiety (P=.26) between baseline and final follow-up, dependent on positive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening. "
5867,2,Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity at baseline was not associated with reduced cannabis use frequency or severity but was linked to greater reductions in depression (Spearman rho=.33) and anxiety (Spearman rho=.28). 
5868,2,"Individuals with positive attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening were significantly less likely to fill out the consumption diary (P=.02), but the association between continuous attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity and retention (Spearman rho=-0.10, P=.13) was nonsignificant. "
5869,2,"There also was no significant intergroup difference in the number of completed modules (with: mean 2.10, SD 2.33; without: mean 2.36, SD 2.36, P=.34), and there was no association with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity (Spearman rho=-0.09; P=.43). "
5870,2,The same was true for the rate of adverse effects (P=.33).
5871,3,Cannabis users screening positive for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder may benefit from CANreduce 2.0 to decrease the frequency and severity of cannabis dependence and attenuate symptoms of depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder-related symptoms. 
5872,3,This web-based program's advantages include its accessibility for remote users and a personalized counselling option that may contribute to increased adherence and motivation to change among program users.
5873,4,Social Media-Delivered Patient Education to Enhance Self-management and Attitudes of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Randomized Controlled Trial
5874,0,The use of mobile health technologies has been necessary to deliver patient education to patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
5875,1,Patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from a clinic through physician referral. 
5876,1,"The social media-based program included 51 videos: 10 about understanding diabetes, 10 about daily care, 6 about nutrition care, 21 about diabetes drugs, and 4 containing quizzes. "
5877,1,"The intervention group received two or three videos every week and care messages every 2 weeks through the social media platform for 3 months, in addition to usual care. "
5878,1,The control group only received usual care. 
5879,1,"Outcomes were measured at clinical visits through self-reported face-to-face questionnaires at baseline and at 3 months after the intervention, including the Simplified Diabetes Knowledge Scale (true/false version), the Diabetes Care Profile-Attitudes Toward Diabetes Scales, the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. "
5880,1,Health literacy was measured at baseline using the Newest Vital Sign tool. 
5881,1,Differences in HbA1c levels and questionnaire scores before and after the intervention were compared between groups. 
5882,1,"The associations of knowledge, attitudes, and self-care activities with health literacy were assessed."
5883,2,"Patients with type 2 diabetes completed the 3-month study, with 91 out of 181 (50.3%) patients in the intervention group and 90 (49.7%) in the control group. "
5884,2,"The change in HbA1c did not significantly differ between groups (intervention group: mean 6.9%, SD 0.8% to mean 7.0%, SD 0.9%, P=.34; control group: mean 6.7%, SD 0.6% to mean 6.7%, SD 0.7%, P=.91). "
5885,2,"Both groups showed increased mean knowledge scores at 12 weeks, increasing from 68.3% (SD 16.4%) to 76.7% (SD 11.7%; P<.001) in the intervention group and from 64.8% (SD 18.2%) to 73.2% (SD 12.6%; P<.001) in the control group. "
5886,2,"Positive improvements in attitudes and self-care activities were only observed in the intervention group (attitudes: mean difference 0.2, SD 0.5, P=.001; self-care activities: mean difference 0.3, SD 1.2, P=.03). "
5887,2,A 100% utility rate was achieved for 8 out of 21 (38%) medication-related videos. 
5888,2,"Low health literacy was a significant risk factor for baseline knowledge scores in the intervention group, with an odds ratio of 2.80 (95% CI 1.28-6.12; P=.01); this became insignificant after 3 months."
5889,3,"The social media-based program was effective at enhancing the knowledge, attitudes, and self-care activities of patients with diabetes. "
5890,3,This intervention was also helpful for patients with low health literacy in diabetes knowledge. 
5891,3,"The program represents a potentially useful tool for delivering diabetes education to patients through social media, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic."
5892,4,Stratified Impacts of the Infodemic During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey in 6 Asian Jurisdictions
5893,0,"Although timely and accurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for containing the disease and reducing mental distress, an infodemic, which refers to an overabundance of information, may trigger unpleasant emotions and reduce compliance. "
5894,0,"Prior research has shown the negative consequences of an infodemic during the pandemic; however, we know less about which subpopulations are more exposed to the infodemic and are more vulnerable to the adverse psychological and behavioral effects."
5895,1,The data for this study were obtained from a cross-national survey of residents in 6 jurisdictions in Asia in May 2020. 
5896,1,The survey targeted residents aged 18 years or older. 
5897,1,A probability-based quota sampling strategy was adopted to ensure that the selected samples matched the population's geographical and demographic characteristics released by the latest available census in each jurisdiction. 
5898,1,"The final sample included 10,063 respondents. "
5899,1,Information overload about COVID-19 was measured by asking the respondents to what extent they feel overwhelmed by news related to COVID-19. 
5900,1,The measure of psychological distress was adapted from the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5). 
5901,1,Protective behaviors included personal hygienic behavior and compliance with social distancing measures.
5902,2,"Younger respondents and women (b=0.20, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.26) were more likely to perceive information overload. "
5903,2,"Participants self-perceived as upper or upper-middle class (b=0.19, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.30) and those with full-time jobs (b=0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17) tended to perceive higher information overload. "
5904,2,"Respondents who more frequently sought COVID-19 information from newspapers (b=0.12, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.14), television (b=0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.09), and family and friends (b=0.11, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.14) were more likely to feel overwhelmed. "
5905,2,"In contrast, obtaining COVID-19 information from online news outlets and social media was not associated with perceived information overload. "
5906,2,"There was a positive relationship between perceived information overload and psychological distress (b=2.18, 95% CI 2.09 to 2.26). "
5907,2,"Such an association was stronger among urban residents, full-time employees, and those living in privately owned housing. "
5908,2,The effect of perceived information overload on protective behavior was not significant.
5909,3,"Our findings revealed that respondents who were younger, were female, had a higher socioeconomic status (SES), and had vulnerable populations in the household were more likely to feel overwhelmed by COVID-19 information. "
5910,3,"Perceived information overload tended to increase psychological distress, and people with higher SES were more vulnerable to this adverse psychological consequence. "
5911,3,Effective policies and interventions should be promoted to target vulnerable populations who are more susceptible to the occurrence and negative psychological influence of perceived information overload.
5912,4,Clinical Outcomes Among Working Adults Using the Health Integrator Smartphone App: Analyses of Prespecified Secondary Outcomes in a Randomized Controlled Trial
5913,0,There is a need to find new methods that can enhance the individuals' engagement in self-care and increase compliance to a healthy lifestyle for the prevention of noncommunicable diseases and improved quality of life. 
5914,0,"Mobile health (mHealth) apps could provide large-scale, cost-efficient digital solutions to implement lifestyle change, which as a corollary may enhance quality of life."
5915,1,The study was a 3-armed parallel randomized controlled trial. 
5916,1,Participants were randomized to a control group or to 1 of 2 intervention groups using the Health Integrator app with or without additional telephone counseling for 3 months. 
5917,1,"Clinical variables were assessed before the start of the intervention (baseline) and after 3 months Due to the nature of the intervention, targeting lifestyle changes, participants were not blinded to their allocation. "
5918,1,"Robust linear regression with complete case analysis was performed to study the intervention effect among the intervention groups, both in the entire sample and stratifying by type of work (office worker vs bus driver) and sex."
5919,2,"Complete data at baseline and follow-up were obtained from 205 and 191 participants, respectively. "
5920,2,The mean age of participants was 48.3 (SD 10) years; 61.5% (126/205) were men and 52.2% (107/205) were bus drivers. 
5921,2,Improvements were observed at follow-up among participants in the intervention arms. 
5922,2,"There was a small statistically significant effect on waist circumference (beta=-0.97, 95% CI -1.84 to -0.10) in the group receiving the app and additional coach support compared to the control group, but no other statistically significant differences were seen. "
5923,2,"However, participants receiving only the app had statistically significantly lower BMI (beta=-0.35, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.09), body weight (beta=-1.08, 95% CI -1.92 to -0.26), waist circumference (beta=-1.35, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.45), and body fat percentage (beta=-0.83, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.02) at follow-up compared to the controls. "
5924,2,"There was a statistically significant difference in systolic blood pressure between the two intervention groups at follow-up (beta=-3.74, 95% CI -7.32 to -0.16); no other statistically significant differences in outcome variables were seen."
5925,3,"Participants randomized to use the Health Integrator smartphone app showed small but statistically significant differences in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and body fat percentage compared to controls after a 3-month intervention. "
5926,3,The effect of additional coaching together with use of the app is unclear.
5927,4,Digital Health Interventions for Weight Management in Children and Adolescents: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
5928,0,Recent meta-analyses suggest the use of technology-based interventions as a treatment option for obesity in adulthood. 
5929,0,Similar meta-analytic approaches for children are scarce.
5930,1,"A systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Cochrane Library for randomized clinical trials to identify interventional studies published between January 2000 and February 2021."
5931,2,"In total, 9 manuscripts from 8 clinical trials of 582 children or adolescents were considered eligible. "
5932,2,"BMI, BMI z-score, and other BMI-related baseline metrics during and after intervention were considered as primary outcomes. "
5933,2,"In 7 of 8 studies, a technology-based intervention was applied in addition to conventional care. "
5934,2,"Of the 8 studies, 6 studies were conducted in the United States, 1 in Australia, and 1 in northwestern Europe. "
5935,2,"In total, 5 studies included adolescents, whereas the rest addressed children aged 9 to 12 years. "
5936,2,Intervention duration ranged from 3 to 24 months. 
5937,2,Significant differences between groups in BMI metric changes were reported by 5 of the 8 studies. 
5938,2,"Pooled analysis revealed an overall significant decrease in BMI metrics in the intervention group (standardized mean difference -0.61, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.13; P=.01). "
5939,2,"Subgroup analysis revealed that significance was lost in case of no parental involvement (standardized mean difference -0.36, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.11; P=.14). "
5940,2,"The small number of clinical trials found, the varying study quality, and the study heterogeneity are some limitations of this review."
5941,3,"The studies reported herein describe functional and acceptable technology-based approaches, in addition to conventional treatments, to enhance weight loss in young populations."
5942,4,Effectiveness of eHealth and mHealth Interventions Supporting Children and Young People Living With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
5943,0,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) management aims to promote remission through timely, individualized, well-coordinated interdisciplinary care using a range of pharmacological, physical, psychological, and educational interventions. "
5944,0,"However, achieving this goal is workforce-intensive. "
5945,0,Harnessing the burgeoning eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) interventions could be a resource-efficient way of supplementing JIA management.
5946,1,We systematically searched 15 databases (2018-2021). 
5947,1,"Studies were eligible if they considered children and young people (aged 1-18 years) diagnosed with JIA, an eHealth or mHealth intervention, any comparator, and health outcomes related to the used interventions. "
5948,1,"Independently, 2 reviewers screened the studies for inclusion and appraised the study quality using the Downs and Black (modified) checklist. "
5949,1,"Study outcomes were summarized using a narrative, descriptive method and, where possible, combined for a meta-analysis using a random-effects model."
5950,2,"Of the 301 studies identified in the search strategy, 15 (5%) fair-to-good-quality studies met the inclusion criteria, which identified 10 interventions for JIA (age 4-18.6 years). "
5951,2,"Of these 10 interventions, 5 (50%) supported symptom monitoring by capturing real-time data using health applications, electronic diaries, or web-based portals to monitor pain or health-related quality of life (HRQoL). "
5952,2,"Within individual studies, a preference was demonstrated for real-time pain monitoring over recall pain assessments because of a peak-end effect, improved time efficiency (P=.002), and meeting children's and young people's HRQoL needs (P<.001) during pediatric rheumatology consultations. "
5953,2,"Furthermore, 20% (2/10) of interventions supported physical activity promotion using a web-based program or a wearable activity tracker. "
5954,2,"The web-based program exhibited a moderate effect, which increased endurance time, physical activity levels, and moderate to vigorous physical activity (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.60, SD 0.02-1.18; I-2=79%; P=.04). "
5955,2,"The final 30% (3/10) of interventions supported self-management development through web-based programs, or apps, facilitating a small effect, reducing pain intensity (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.15; I-2=53%; P=.33), and increasing disease knowledge and self-efficacy (SMD 0.30, 95% CI 0.03-0.56; I-2=74%; P=.03). "
5956,2,These results were not statistically significant. 
5957,2,"No effect was seen regarding pain interference, HRQoL, anxiety, depression, pain coping, disease activity, functional ability, or treatment adherence."
5958,3,Evidence that supports the inclusion of eHealth and mHealth interventions in JIA management is increasing. 
5959,3,"However, this evidence needs to be considered cautiously because of the small sample size, wide CIs, and moderate to high statistical heterogeneity. "
5960,3,"More rigorous research is needed on the longitudinal effects of real-time monitoring, web-based pediatric rheumatologist-children and young people interactions, the comparison among different self-management programs, and the use of wearable technologies as an objective measurement for monitoring physical activity before any recommendations that inform current practice can be given."
5961,4,A Novel Virtual Reality Assessment of Functional Cognition: Validation Study
5962,0,"Cognitive deficits are present in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, and depression. "
5963,0,"Assessments used to measure cognition in these disorders are time-consuming, burdensome, and have low ecological validity. "
5964,0,"To address these limitations, we developed a novel virtual reality shopping task-VStore."
5965,1,A total of 142 healthy volunteers aged 20-79 years participated in the study. 
5966,1,"The main VStore outcomes included verbal recall of 12 grocery items, time to collect items, time to select items on a self-checkout machine, time to make the payment, time to order coffee, and total completion time. "
5967,1,"Construct validity was examined through a series of backward elimination regression models to establish which Cogstate tasks, measuring attention, processing speed, verbal and visual learning, working memory, executive function, and paired associate learning, in addition to age and technological familiarity, best predicted VStore performance. "
5968,1,"In addition, 2 ridge regression and 2 logistic regression models supplemented with receiver operating characteristic curves were built, with VStore outcomes in the first model and Cogstate outcomes in the second model entered as predictors of age and age cohorts, respectively."
5969,2,"Overall VStore performance, as indexed by the total time spent completing the task, was best explained by Cogstate tasks measuring attention, working memory, paired associate learning, and age and technological familiarity, accounting for 47% of the variance. "
5970,2,"In addition, with lambda=5.16, the ridge regression model selected 5 parameters for VStore when predicting age (mean squared error 185.80, SE 19.34), and with lambda=9.49 for Cogstate, the model selected all 8 tasks (mean squared error 226.80, SE 23.48). "
5971,2,"Finally, VStore was found to be highly sensitive (87%) and specific (91.7%) to age cohorts, with 94.6% of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve."
5972,3,Our findings suggest that VStore is a promising assessment that engages standard cognitive domains and is sensitive to age-related cognitive decline.
5973,4,Use of the Mclsaac Score to Predict Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis in Outpatient Nurse Phone Triage and Electronic Visits Compared With In-Person Visits: Retrospective Observational Study
5974,0,The Mclsaac criteria are a validated scoring system used to determine the likelihood of an acute sore throat being caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) to stratify patients who need strep testing.
5975,1,"This retrospective study compared the percentage of positive GAS tests by Mclsaac score for scores calculated during nurse protocol phone encounters, e-visits (electronic visits), and in person f2f clinic visits."
5976,2,There was no difference in percentages of positive strep tests between encounter types for any of the Mclsaac scores. 
5977,2,There were significantly more phone and e-visit encounters with any missing score components compared with f2f visits. 
5978,2,"For individual score components, there were significantly fewer e-visits missing fever and cough information compared with phone encounters and f2f encounters. "
5979,2,F2f encounters were significantly less likely to be missing descriptions of tonsils and lymphadenopathy compared with phone and e-visit encounters. 
5980,2,Mclsaac scores of 4 had positive GAS rates of 55% to 68% across encounter types. 
5981,2,There were 4 encounters not missing any score components with a Mclsaac score of 0. 
5982,2,None of these 4 encounters had a positive GAS test.
5983,3,Mclsaac scores of 4 collected during non-f2f care could be used to consider empiric treatment for GAS without testing if significant barriers to testing exist such as the COVID-19 pandemic or geographic barriers. 
5984,3,Future studies should evaluate further whether non-f2f encounters with Mclsaac scores of 0 can be safely excluded from GAS testing.
5985,4,Assessing the Implementation and Effectiveness of the Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Tool for Older Adults With Complex Care Needs: Mixed Methods Study
5986,0,Goal-oriented care is being adopted to deliver person-centered primary care to older adults with multimothidity and complex care needs. 
5987,0,"Although this model holds promise, its implementation remains a challenge. "
5988,0,"Digital health solutions may enable processes to improve adoption; however, they require evaluation to determine feasibility and impact."
5989,1,"A multimethod, pragmatic randomized controlled trial using a stepped-wedge design and ethnographic case studies was conducted over a 15-month period in 6 comprehensive primary care practices across Ontario with a target enrollment of 176 patients. "
5990,1,The 6 practices were randomized into either early (3-month control period; 12-month intervention) or late (6-month control period; 9-month intervention) groups. 
5991,1,The primary outcome measure of interest was the Assessment of Quality of Life-4D (AQoL-4D). 
5992,1,Data were collected at baseline and at 3 monthly intervals for the duration of the trial. 
5993,1,Ethnographic data included observations and interviews with patients and providers at the midpoint and end of the intervention. 
5994,1,"Outcome data were analyzed using linear models conducted at the individual level, accounting for cluster effects at the practice level, and ethnographic data were analyzed using qualitative description and framework analysis methods."
5995,2,"Recruitment challenges resulted in fewer sites and participants than expected; of the 176 target, only 142 (80.6%) patients were identified as eligible to participate because of lower-than-expected provider participation and fewer-than-expected patients willing to participate or perceived as ready to engage in goal-setting. "
5996,2,"Of the 142 patients approached, 45 (32%) participated. "
5997,2,"Patients set a variety of goals related to self-management, mental health, social health, and overall well-being. "
5998,2,"Owing to underpowering, the impact of ePRO on quality of life could not be definitively assessed; however, the intervention group, ePRO plus usual care (mean 15.28, SD 18.60) demonstrated a nonsignificant decrease in quality of life (t(24) =-1.20; P=.24) when compared with usual care only (mean 21.76, SD 2.17). "
5999,2,The ethnographic data reveal a complex implementation process in which the meaningfulness (or coherence) of the technology to individuals' lives and work acted as a key driver of adoption and tool appraisal.
6000,3,This trial experienced many unexpected and significant implementation challenges related to recruitment and engagement. 
6001,3,"Future studies could be improved through better alignment of the research methods and intervention to the complex and diverse clinical settings, dynamic goal-oriented care process, and readiness of provider and patient participants."
6002,4,Establishing a Working Definition of User Experience for eHealth Interventions of Self-reported User Experience Measures With eHealth Researchers and Adolescents: Scoping Review
6003,0,"Across eHealth intervention studies involving children, adolescents, and their parents, researchers have measured user experience to assist with intervention development, refinement, and evaluation. "
6004,0,"To date, no widely accepted definitions or measures of user experience exist to support a standardized approach for evaluation and comparison within or across interventions."
6005,1,"We systematically searched electronic databases for published and gray literature available from January 1, 2005, to April 11, 2019. "
6006,1,"We included studies assessing an eHealth intervention that targeted any health condition and was designed for use by children, adolescents, and their parents. "
6007,1,"eHealth interventions needed to be web-, computer-, or mobile-based, mediated by the internet with some degree of interactivity. "
6008,1,"We required studies to report the measurement of user experience as first-person experiences, involving cognitive and behavioral factors reported by intervention users. "
6009,1,"We appraised the quality of user experience measures in included studies using published criteria: well-established, approaching well-established, promising, or not yet established. "
6010,1,We conducted a descriptive analysis of how user experience was defined and measured in each study. 
6011,1,Review findings subsequently informed the survey questions used in the Delphi consultations with eHealth researchers and adolescent users for how user experience should be defined and measured.
6012,2,"Of the 8634 articles screened for eligibility, 129 articles and 1 erratum were included in the review. "
6013,2,A total of 30 eHealth researchers and 27 adolescents participated in the Delphi consultations. 
6014,2,"On the basis of the literature and consultations, we proposed working definitions for 6 main user experience domains: acceptability, satisfaction, credibility, usability, user-reported adherence, and perceived impact. "
6015,2,"Although most studies incorporated a study-specific measure, we identified 10 well-established measures to quantify 5 of the 6 domains of user experience (all except for self-reported adherence). "
6016,2,Our adolescent and researcher participants ranked perceived impact as one of the most important domains of user experience and usability as one of the least important domains. 
6017,2,Rankings between adolescents and researchers diverged for other domains.
6018,3,Findings highlight the various ways in which user experience has been defined and measured across studies and what aspects are most valued by researchers and adolescent users. 
6019,3,We propose incorporating the working definitions and available measures of user experience to support consistent evaluation and reporting of outcomes across studies. 
6020,3,"Future studies can refine the definitions and measurement of user experience, explore how user experience relates to other eHealth outcomes, and inform the design and use of human-centered eHealth interventions."
6021,4,A Smartphone Intervention for People With Serious Mental Illness: Fully Remote Randomized Controlled Trial of CORE
6022,0,People with serious mental illness (SMI) have significant unmet mental health needs. 
6023,0,Development and testing of digital interventions that can alleviate the suffering of people with SMI is a public health priority.
6024,1,Individuals were recruited via the web using Google and Facebook advertisements. 
6025,1,Enrolled participants were randomized into either active intervention or waitlist control groups. 
6026,1,"Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Hamilton Program for Schizophrenia Voices, Green Paranoid Thought Scale, Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Friendship Scale, and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) at baseline (T1), 30-day (T2), and 60-day (T3) assessment points. "
6027,1,"Participants in the active group used CORE from T1 to T2, and participants in the waitlist group used CORE from T2 to T3. "
6028,1,Both groups completed usability and accessibility measures after they concluded their intervention periods.
6029,2,"Overall, 315 individuals from 45 states participated in this study. "
6030,2,"The sample comprised individuals with self-reported bipolar disorder (111/315, 35.2%), major depressive disorder (136/315, 43.2%), and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (68/315, 21.6%) who displayed moderate to severe symptoms and disability levels at baseline. "
6031,2,Participants rated CORE as highly usable and acceptable. 
6032,2,"Intent-to-treat analyses showed significant treatmentxtime interactions for the BDI-II (F-1,(313)=13.38; P<.001), GAD-7 (F-1,(313)=5.87; P=.01), RAS (F-1,(313)=23.42; P<.001), RSES (F-1,(313)=19.28; P<.001), and SDS (F-1,(313)=10.73; P=.001). "
6033,2,"Large effects were observed for the BDI-II (d=0.58), RAS (d=0.61), and RSES (d=0.64); a moderate effect size was observed for the SDS (d=0.44), and a small effect size was observed for the GAD-7 (d=0.20). "
6034,2,Similar changes in outcome measures were later observed in the waitlist control group participants following crossover after they received CORE (T2 to T3). 
6035,2,"Approximately 41.5% (64/154) of participants in the active group and 60.2% (97/161) of participants in the waitlist group were retained at T2, and 33.1% (51/154) of participants in the active group and 40.3% (65/161) of participants in the waitlist group were retained at T3."
6036,3,"We successfully recruited, screened, randomized, treated, and assessed a geographically dispersed sample of participants with SMI entirely via the web, demonstrating that fully remote clinical trials are feasible in this population; however, study retention remains challenging. "
6037,3,"CORE showed promise as a usable, acceptable, and effective tool for reducing the severity of psychiatric symptoms and disability while improving recovery and self-esteem. "
6038,3,Rapid adoption and real-world dissemination of evidence-based mobile health interventions such as CORE are needed if we are to shorten the science-to-service gap and address the significant unmet mental health needs of people with SMI during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
6039,4,Remote Digital Psychiatry for Mobile Mental Health Assessment and Therapy: MindLogger Platform Development Study
6040,0,Universal access to assessment and treatment of mental health and learning disorders remains a significant and unmet need. 
6041,0,"There are many people without access to care because of economic, geographic, and cultural barriers, as well as the limited availability of clinical experts who could help advance our understanding and treatment of mental health."
6042,1,We searched for products that satisfy these requirements. 
6043,1,"We designed and developed a new software platform called MindLogger, which exceeds the requirements. "
6044,1,"To demonstrate the platform's configurability, we built multiple applets (collections of activities) within the MindLogger mobile app and deployed several of them, including a comprehensive set of assessments underway in a large-scale, longitudinal mental health study."
6045,2,"Of the hundreds of products we researched, we found 10 that met our primary requirements with 4 that support end-to-end encryption, 2 that enable restricted access to individual users' data, 1 that provides open-source software, and none that satisfy all three. "
6046,2,"We compared features related to information presentation and data capture capabilities; privacy and security; and access to the product, code, and data. "
6047,2,"We successfully built MindLogger mobile and web applications, as well as web browser-based tools for building and editing new applets and for administering them to end users. "
6048,2,"MindLogger has end-to-end encryption, enables restricted access, is open source, and supports a variety of data collection features. "
6049,2,"One applet is currently collecting data from children and adolescents in our mental health study, and other applets are in different stages of testing and deployment for use in clinical and research settings."
6050,3,"We demonstrated the flexibility and applicability of the MindLogger platform through its deployment in a large-scale, longitudinal, mobile mental health study and by building a variety of other mental health-related applets. "
6051,3,"With this release, we encourage a broad range of users to apply the MindLogger platform to create and test applets to advance health care and scientific research. "
6052,3,We hope that increasing the availability of applets designed to assess and administer interventions will facilitate access to health care in the general population.
6053,4,The Sociological Perspective of Users Invisible Work: A Qualitative Research Framework for Studying Digital Health Innovations Integration
6054,0,"When new technology is integrated into a care pathway, it faces resistance due to the changes it introduces into the existing context. "
6055,0,"To understand the success or failure of digital health innovations, it is necessary to pay attention to the adjustments that users must perform to make them work, by reshaping the context and sometimes by altering the ways in which they perform activities. "
6056,0,"This adaptation work, most of which remains invisible, constitutes an important factor in the success of innovations and the ways in which they transform care practices."
6057,1,This paper uses a three-part method to structure a theoretical model to study users' invisible work. 
6058,1,"The first part of the method includes a thematic literature review, previously published by one of the coauthors, of major sociological studies conducted on digital health innovations integration into existing care organizations and practices. "
6059,1,The second part extends this review to introduce definitions and applications of the users' invisible work concept. 
6060,1,The third part consists of producing a theoretical framework to study the concept according to the different contexts and practices of the users.
6061,2,"The paper proposes four dimensions (organizational, interactional, practical, and experiential), each composed of a set of criteria that allow a comparative analysis of different users' work according to different health technologies."
6062,3,This framework can be applied both as an analytical tool in a research protocol and as an agenda to identify less visible adoption criteria for digital health technologies.
6063,4,Moderators of the Effect of a Self-directed Digitally Delivered Exercise Program for People With Knee Osteoarthritis: Exploratory Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial
6064,0,A 24-week self-directed digitally delivered intervention was found to improve pain and function in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA). 
6065,0,"However, it is possible that this intervention may be better suited to certain subgroups of people with knee OA compared to others."
6066,1,An exploratory analysis was conducted on data from a randomized controlled trial involving 206 people with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA. 
6067,1,"This trial compared a self-directed digitally delivered intervention comprising of web-based education, exercise, and physical activity program supported by automated exercise behavior change mobile phone text messages to web-based education alone (control). "
6068,1,The primary outcomes were changes in overall knee pain (assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale) and physical function (assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function sub scale [WOMAC]) at 24 weeks. 
6069,1,"Five baseline patient characteristics were selected as the potential moderators: (1) number of comorbidities, (2) number of other painful joints, (3) pain self-efficacy, (4) exercise self-efficacy, and (5) self-perceived importance of exercise. "
6070,1,"Separate linear regression models for each primary outcome and each potential moderator were fit, including treatment group, moderator, and interaction between treatment group and moderator, adjusting for the outcome at baseline."
6071,2,There was evidence that pain self-efficacy moderated the effect of the intervention on physical function compared to the control at 24 weeks (interaction P=.02). 
6072,2,Posthoc assessment of the mean change in WOMAC function by treatment arm showed that each 1-unit increase in baseline pain self-efficacy was associated with a 1.52 (95% CI 0.27 to 2.78) unit improvement in the control group. 
6073,2,"In contrast, a reduction of 0.62 (95% CI -1.93 to 0.68) units was observed in the intervention group with each unit increase in pain self-efficacy. "
6074,2,"There was only weak evidence that pain self-efficacy moderated the effect of the intervention on pain and that number of comorbidities, number of other painful joints, exercise self-efficacy, or exercise importance moderated the effect of the intervention on pain or function."
6075,3,"With the exception of pain self-efficacy, which moderated changes in function but not pain, we found limited evidence that our selected baseline patient characteristics moderated intervention outcomes. "
6076,3,This indicates that people with a range of baseline characteristics respond similarly to the unsupervised digitally delivered exercise intervention. 
6077,3,"As these findings are exploratory in nature, they require confirmation in future studies."
6078,4,Implementation Strategies to Improve Engagement With a Multi-Institutional Patient Portal: Multimethod Study
6079,0,Comprehensive multi-institutional patient portals that provide patients with web-based access to their data from across the health system have been shown to improve the provision of patient-centered and integrated care. 
6080,0,"However, several factors hinder the implementation of these portals. "
6081,0,"Although barriers and facilitators to patient portal adoption are well documented, there is a dearth of evidence examining how to effectively implement multi-institutional patient portals that transcend traditional boundaries and disparate systems."
6082,1,"This multimethod study included an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data collected during an evaluation of the multi-institutional MyChart patient portal that was deployed in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. "
6083,1,Descriptive statistics were performed to understand the use patterns during the first 15 months of implementation (between August 2018 and October 2019). 
6084,1,"In addition, 42 qualitative semistructured interviews were conducted with 18 administrative stakeholders, 16 patients, 7 health care providers, and 1 informal caregiver to understand how the implementation approach influenced user experiences and to identify strategies for improvement. "
6085,1,Qualitative data were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis approach.
6086,2,"Between August 2018 and October 2019, 15,271 registration emails were sent, with 67.01% (10,233/15,271) registered for an account across 38 health care sites. "
6087,2,"The median number of patients registered per site was 19, with considerable variation (range 1-2114). "
6088,2,"Of the total number of sites, 55% (21/38) had <= 30 registered patients, whereas only 2 sites had over 1000 registered patients. "
6089,2,Interview participants perceived that the patient experience of the portal would have been improved by enhancing the data comprehensiveness of the technology. 
6090,2,They also attributed the lack of enrollment to the absence of a broad rollout and marketing strategy across sites. 
6091,2,"Participants emphasized that provider engagement, change management support, and senior leadership endorsement were central to fostering uptake. "
6092,2,"Finally, many stated that regional alignment and policy support should have been sought to streamline implementation efforts across participating sites."
6093,3,"Without proper management and planning, multi-institutional portals can suffer from minimal adoption. "
6094,3,Data comprehensiveness is the foundational component of these portals and requires aligned policies and a key base of technology infrastructure across all participating sites. 
6095,3,"It is important to look beyond the category of the technology (ie, patient portal) and consider its functionality (eg, data aggregation, appointment scheduling, messaging) to ensure that it aligns with the underlying strategic priorities of the deployment. "
6096,3,It is also critical to establish a clear vision and ensure buy-ins from organizational leadership and health care providers to support a cultural shift that will enable a meaningful and widespread engagement.
6097,4,"Effectiveness of Smartphone-Based Community Case Management on the Urgent Referral, Reconsultation, and Hospitalization of Children Aged Under 5 Years in Malawi: Cluster-Randomized, Stepped-Wedge Trial"
6098,0,"Integrated community case management (CCM) has led to reductions in child mortality in Malawi resulting from illnesses such as malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea. "
6099,0,"However, adherence to CCM guidelines is often poor, potentially leading to inappropriate clinical decisions and poor outcomes. "
6100,0,"We determined the impact of an e-CCM app on the referral, reconsultation, and hospitalization rates of children presenting to village clinics in Malawi."
6101,1,"We used a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial to compare paper-based CCM (control) with and without the use of an e-CCM app on smartphones from November 2016 to February 2017. "
6102,1,"A total of 102 village clinics from 2 districts in northern Malawi were assigned to 1 of 6 clusters, which were randomized on the sequencing of the crossover from the control phase to the intervention phase as well as the duration of exposure in each phase. "
6103,1,Children aged >= 2 months to <5 years who presented with acute illness were enrolled consecutively by health surveillance assistants. 
6104,1,The primary outcome of urgent referrals to higher-level facilities was evaluated by using multilevel mixed effects models. 
6105,1,A logistic regression model with the random effects of the cluster and the fixed effects for each step was fitted. 
6106,1,"The adjustment for potential confounders included baseline factors, such as patient age, sex, and the geographical location of the village clinics. "
6107,1,Calendar time was adjusted for in the analysis.
6108,2,A total of 6965 children were recruited-49.11% (3421/6965) in the control phase and 50.88% (3544/6965) in the intervention phase. 
6109,2,"After adjusting for calendar time, children in the intervention phase were more likely to be urgently referred to a higher-level health facility than children in the control phase (odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.27-3.23; P=.003). "
6110,2,"Overall, children in the intervention arm had lower odds of attending a repeat health surveillance assistant consultation (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34-0.59; P<.001) or being admitted to a hospital (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90; P=.002), but after adjusting for time, these differences were not significant (P=.07 for consultation; P=.30 for hospital admission)."
6111,3,"The addition of e-CCM decision support by using smartphones led to a greater proportion of children being referred to higher-level facilities, with no apparent increase in hospital admissions or repeat consultations in village clinics. "
6112,3,Our findings provide support for the implementation of e-CCM tools in Malawi and other low- and middle-income countries with a need for ongoing assessments of effectiveness and integration with national digital health strategies.
6113,4,Circadian Rhythm Analysis Using Wearable Device Data: Novel Penalized Machine Learning Approach
6114,0,"Wearable devices have been widely used in clinical studies to study daily activity patterns, but the analysis remains a major obstacle for researchers."
6115,1,We developed a machine learning-based Penalized Multiband Learning (PML) algorithm to sequentially infer dominant periodicities based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm and further characterize daily rhythms. 
6116,1,"We implemented and applied the algorithm to Actiwatch data collected from a cohort of 262 healthy infants at ages 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, with 159, 101, 111, and 141 participants at each time point, respectively. "
6117,1,Autocorrelation analysis and Fisher test in harmonic analysis with Bonferroni correction were applied for comparison with the PML. 
6118,1,"The association between activity rhythm features and early childhood motor development, assessed using the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-Second Edition (PDMS-2), was studied through linear regression analysis."
6119,2,"The PML results showed that 1-day periodicity was most dominant at 6 and 12 months, whereas one-day, one-third-day, and half-day periodicities were most dominant at 18 and 24 months. "
6120,2,"These periodicities were all significant in the Fisher test, with one-fourth-day periodicity also significant at 12 months. "
6121,2,Autocorrelation effectively detected 1-day periodicity but not the other periodicities. 
6122,2,"At 6 months, PDMS-2 was associated with the assessment seasons. "
6123,2,"At 12 months, PDMS-2 was associated with the assessment seasons and FFT signals at one-third-day periodicity (P<.001) and half-day periodicity (P=.04), respectively. "
6124,2,"In particular, the subcategories of stationary, locomotion, and gross motor were associated with the FFT signals at one-third-day periodicity (P<.001)."
6125,3,The proposed PML algorithm can effectively conduct circadian rhythm analysis using time-series wearable device data. 
6126,3,The application of the method effectively characterized sleep-wake rhythm development and identified the association between daily rhythm formation and motor development during early childhood.
6127,4,Effect of Digital Care Platforms on Quality of Care for Oncological Patients and Barriers and Facilitators for Their Implementation: Systematic Review
6128,0,"Oncological health care services are challenged by the increasing number of cancer survivors, long-term follow-up care, and fragmentation of care. "
6129,0,"Digital care platforms are potential tools to deliver affordable, patient-centered oncological care. "
6130,0,"Previous reviews evaluated only one feature of a digital care platform or did not evaluate the effect on enhancement of information, self-efficacy, continuity of care, or patient- and health care provider-reported experiences. "
6131,0,"Additionally, they have not focused on the barriers and facilitators for implementation of a digital care platform in oncological care."
6132,1,"The PubMed (Medline), Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for the period from January 2000 to May 2020 for studies assessing the effect of a digital care platform on the predefined outcome parameters in oncological patients and studies describing barriers and facilitators for implementation. "
6133,1,Synthesis of the results was performed qualitatively. 
6134,1,Barriers and facilitators were categorized according to the framework of Grol and Wensing. 
6135,1,The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used for critical appraisal of the studies.
6136,2,"Seventeen studies were included for final analysis, comprising 8 clinical studies on the effectiveness of the digital care platform and 13 studies describing barriers and facilitators. "
6137,2,Usage of a digital care platform appeared to enhance the availability of information and self-efficacy. 
6138,2,There were no data available on the effect of a digital care platform on the continuity of care. 
6139,2,"However, based on focus group interviews, digital care platforms could potentially improve continuity of care by optimizing the exchange of patient information across institutes. "
6140,2,Patient-reported experiences such as satisfaction with the platform were considerably positive. 
6141,2,"Most barriers for implementation were identified at the professional level, such as the concern for increased workload and unattended release of medical information to patients. "
6142,2,"Most facilitators were found at the patient and innovation levels, such as improved patient-doctor communication and patient empowerment. "
6143,2,There were few barriers and facilitators mentioned at the economic and political levels.
6144,3,The use of digital care platforms is associated with better quality of care through enhancement of availability of information and increased self-efficacy for oncological patients. 
6145,3,The numerous facilitators identified at the patient level illustrate that patients are positive toward a digital care platform. 
6146,3,"However, despite these favorable results, robust evidence concerning the effectiveness of digital care platforms, especially from high-quality studies, is still lacking. "
6147,3,"Future studies should therefore aim to further investigate the effectiveness of digital care platforms, and the barriers and facilitators to their implementation at the economic and political levels."
6148,4,Privacy Practices of Health Information Technologies: Privacy Policy Risk Assessment Study and Proposed Guidelines
6149,0,"Along with the proliferation of health information technologies (HITs), there is a growing need to understand the potential privacy risks associated with using such tools. "
6150,0,"Although privacy policies are designed to inform consumers, such policies have consistently been found to be confusing and lack transparency."
6151,1,"In phase 1, participatory design workshops were conducted with young people who were attending a participating headspace center, their supportive others, and health professionals and service providers from the centers. "
6152,1,The findings were knowledge translated to determine participant preferences for the presentation and availability of privacy information and the functionality required to support its delivery. 
6153,1,"Phase 2 included the development of the 23-item privacy policy risk assessment tool, which incorporated material from international privacy literature and standards. "
6154,1,This tool was then used to assess the privacy policies of 34 apps and e-tools. 
6155,1,"In phase 3, privacy guidelines, which were derived from learnings from a collaborative consultation process with key stakeholders, were developed to assist health professionals and service providers with understanding the privacy risks associated with incorporating HITs as a part of clinical care."
6156,2,"When considering the use of HITs, the participatory design workshop participants indicated that they wanted privacy information to be easily accessible, transparent, and user-friendly to enable them to clearly understand what personal and health information will be collected and how these data will be shared and stored. "
6157,2,"The privacy policy review revealed consistently poor readability and transparency, which limited the utility of these documents as a source of information. "
6158,2,"Therefore, to enable informed consent, the privacy guidelines provided ensure that health professionals and consumers are fully aware of the potential for privacy risks in using HITs to support health and well-being."
6159,3,"A lack of transparency in privacy policies has the potential to undermine consumers' ability to trust that the necessary measures are in place to secure and protect the privacy of their personal and health information, thus precluding their willingness to engage with HITs. "
6160,3,"The application of the privacy guidelines will improve the confidence of health professionals and service providers in the privacy of consumer data, thus enabling them to recommend HITs to provide or support care."
6161,4,Web-Based Behavioral Intervention Utilizing Narrative Persuasion for HIV Prevention Among Chinese Men Who Have Sex With Men (HeHe Talks Project): Intervention Development
6162,0,"In the era of potent antiretroviral therapy, a high level of condomless anal intercourse continues to drive increases in HIV incidence in recent years among men who have sex with men. "
6163,0,Effective behavior change strategies for promoting HIV-preventive behaviors are warranted. 
6164,0,Narrative persuasion is a novel health communication approach that has demonstrated its persuasive advantages in overcoming resistance to counterattitudinal messages. 
6165,0,"The efficacy of narrative persuasion in promoting health behavior changes has been well documented, but critical research gaps exist for its application to HIV prevention."
6166,1,Persuasive themes and subtopics related to reducing condomless anal intercourse were initially proposed based on epidemiological evidence. 
6167,1,The biographic narrative interview method was used to elicit firsthand experiential stories from a maximum variation sample of local men who have sex with men with diverse backgrounds and experiences related to HIV prevention; different types of role models were established accordingly. 
6168,1,Framework analysis was used to aggregate the original quotations from narrators into collective narratives under 6 intervention themes. 
6169,1,A dedicated website was finally developed for intervention delivery.
6170,2,A series of video-based intervention messages in biographic narrative format (firsthand experiential stories shared by men who have sex with men) combined with topic-equivalent argumentative messages were produced and programmed into 6 intervention sessions. 
6171,2,The 6-week intervention program can be automatically delivered and monitored online.
6172,3,We systematically created a web-based HIV prevention intervention derived from peer-generated stories. 
6173,3,Strategies used to enhance the efficacy of the narrative intervention have been discussed within basic communication components. 
6174,3,"This paper describes the methods and experiences of the rigorous development of a narrative communication intervention for HIV prevention, which enables replication of the intervention in the future."
6175,4,Predicting the Mortality and Readmission of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients With Electronic Health Records: A Machine Learning Approach
6176,0,In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is associated with high mortality and health care costs in the recovery phase. 
6177,0,"Predicting adverse outcome events, including readmission, improves the chance for appropriate interventions and reduces health care costs. "
6178,0,"However, studies related to the early prediction of adverse events of IHCA survivors are rare. "
6179,0,"Therefore, we used a deep learning model for prediction in this study."
6180,1,"National Health Insurance Research Database claims data, including 168,693 patients who had experienced IHCA at least once and 1,569,478 clinical records, were obtained to generate a data set for outcome prediction. "
6181,1,We predicted the 30-day mortality/readmission after each current record (ALL-mortality/ALL-readmission) and 30-day mortality/readmission after IHCA (cardiac arrest [CA]-mortality/CA-readmission). 
6182,1,We developed a hierarchical vectorizer (HVec) deep learning model to extract patients' information and predict mortality and readmission. 
6183,1,"To embed the textual medical concepts of the clinical records into our deep learning model, we used Text2Node to compute the distributed representations of all medical concept codes as a 128-dimensional vector. "
6184,1,"Along with the patient's demographic information, our novel HVec model generated embedding vectors to hierarchically describe the health status at the record-level and patient-level. "
6185,1,Multitask learning involving two main tasks and auxiliary tasks was proposed. 
6186,1,"As CA-mortality and CA-readmission were rare, person upsampling of patients with CA and weighting of CA records were used to improve prediction performance."
6187,2,"With the multitask learning setting in the model learning process, we achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.752 for CA-mortality, 0.711 for ALL-mortality, 0.852 for CA-readmission, and 0.889 for ALL-readmission. "
6188,2,The area under the receiver operating characteristic was improved to 0.808 for CA-mortality and 0.862 for CA-readmission after solving the extremely imbalanced issue for CA-mortality/CA-readmission by upsampling and weighting.
6189,3,This study demonstrated the potential of predicting future outcomes for IHCA survivors by machine learning. 
6190,3,The results showed that our proposed approach could effectively alleviate data imbalance problems and train a better model for outcome prediction.
6191,4,Using Telehealth to Deliver Primary Care to Adolescents During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic: National Survey Study of US Primary Care Professionals
6192,0,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented use of telehealth, including by primary care professionals (PCPs) who serve adolescents."
6193,1,"From February to March 2021, we conducted a web-based survey of 1047 PCPs in the United States. "
6194,1,"Our national sample included physicians (747/1047, 71%), advanced practice providers (177/1047, 17%), and nurses (123/1047, 12%) who provided primary care to adolescents aged 11-17 years."
6195,2,"Most PCPs reported using telehealth for a low, moderate, or high proportion of their adolescent patients in the three months prior to the survey (424/1047, 40%, 286/1047, 27%, and 219/1047, 21%, respectively); only 11% (118/1047) reported no use. "
6196,2,"A majority of respondents agreed that adolescent telehealth increases access to care (720/1047, 69%) and enables them to provide high-quality care (560/1047, 53%). "
6197,2,"Few believed that adolescent telehealth takes too much time (142/1047, 14%) or encourages health care overuse (157/1047, 15%). "
6198,2,"Most supported giving families the option of adolescent telehealth for primary care after the pandemic is over (683/1047, 65%) and believed that health insurance plans should continue to reimburse for telehealth visits (863/1047, 82%). "
6199,2,"Approximately two-thirds (702/1047, 67%) wanted to offer adolescent telehealth visits after the pandemic, with intentions being higher among those with recent telehealth experience (P<.001)."
6200,3,PCPs in our national sample reported widespread use of and predominantly positive attitudes toward adolescent telehealth. 
6201,3,Our findings also suggest broad support among PCPs for continuing to offer adolescent telehealth after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.
6202,4,"Presentation, Treatment, and Natural Course of Severe Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infections Measured by a Smartphone App: Observational and Feasibility Study"
6203,0,Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common conditions in women. 
6204,0,"Current information on the presentation, management, and natural course of the infection is based on paper diaries filled out and subsequently posted by patients."
6205,1,A smartphone app was developed to collect data from study participants presenting with symptoms of UTI in general practice. 
6206,1,"After initial demographic and treatment information, symptom severity was recorded by the patient after a reminder on their smartphone, which occurred twice daily for a period of 7 days or until symptom resolution."
6207,2,A total of 181 women aged 18-76 years downloaded the smartphone app. 
6208,2,The duration of symptoms was determined from the results of 178 participants. 
6209,2,"All patients submitted a urine sample, most patients were prescribed an antibiotic (163/181, 90.1%), and 38.7% (70/181) of the patients had a positive culture. "
6210,2,"Moderately bad or worse symptoms lasted a mean of 3.8 (SD 3.2; median 4) days, and 70.2% (125/178) of the patients indicated that they were cured on day 4 after consultation. "
6211,2,This compares with other research assessing symptom duration and management of UTIs using paper diaries. 
6212,2,Patients were very positive about the usability of the smartphone app and often found the reminders supportive. 
6213,2,"On the basis of the feedback and the analysis of the data, some suggestions for improvement were made."
6214,3,Smartphone diaries for symptom scores over the course of infections are an efficient and acceptable means of collecting data in research.
6215,4,Consumer Perspectives on Maternal and Infant Health Apps: Qualitative Content Analysis
6216,0,"Despite the popularity of maternal and infant health mobile apps, ongoing consumer engagement and sustained app use remain barriers. "
6217,0,Few studies have examined user experiences or perceived benefits of maternal and infant health app use from consumer perspectives.
6218,1,We conducted a qualitative assessment of publicly available user reviews (N=2422) sampled from 75 maternal and infant health apps designed to provide health education or decision-making support to pregnant women or parents and caregivers of infants. 
6219,1,The reviews were coded and analyzed using a general inductive qualitative content analysis approach.
6220,2,"The three major themes included the following: app functionality, where users discussed app features and functions; technical aspects, where users talked about technology-based aspects of an app; and app content, where users specifically focused on the app content and the information it provides. "
6221,2,"The six minor themes included the following: patterns of use, where users highlighted the frequency and type of use; social support, where users talked about receiving social support from friends, family and community of other users; app cost, where users talked about the cost of an app within the context of being cost-effective or a potential waste of money; app comparisons, where users compared one app with others available in app stores; assistance in health care, where users specifically highlighted the role of an app in offering clinical assistance; and customer care support, where users specifically talked about their interaction with the app customer care support team."
6222,3,"Users generally tend to value apps that are of low cost and preferably free, with high-quality content, superior features, enhanced technical aspects, and user-friendly interfaces. "
6223,3,"Users also find app developer responsiveness to be integral, as it offers them an opportunity to engage in the app development and delivery process. "
6224,3,"These findings may be beneficial for app developers in designing better apps, as no best practice guidelines currently exist for the app environment."
6225,4,"Variation of Daily Care Demand in Swiss General Hospitals: Longitudinal Study on Capacity Utilization, Patient Turnover and Clinical Complexity Levels"
6226,0,Variations in hospitals' care demand relies not only on the patient volume but also on the disease severity. 
6227,0,Understanding both daily severity and patient volume in hospitals could help to identify hospital pressure zones to improve hospital-capacity planning and policy-making.
6228,1,A retrospective population-based analysis was conducted with 1 year of routine data of 1.2 million inpatients from 102 Swiss general hospitals. 
6229,1,Capacity utilization was measured as a percentage of the daily maximum number of inpatients. 
6230,1,Patient turnover was measured as a percentage of the daily sum of admissions and discharges per hospital. 
6231,1,Patient clinical complexity level was measured as the average daily patient disease severity per hospital from the clinical complexity algorithm.
6232,2,There was a pronounced variability of care demand in Swiss general hospitals. 
6233,2,"Among hospitals, the average daily capacity utilization ranged from 57.8% (95% CI 57.3-58.4) to 87.7% (95% CI 87.3-88.0), patient turnover ranged from 22.5% (95% CI 22.1-22.8) to 34.5% (95% CI 34.3-34.7), and the mean patient clinical complexity level ranged from 1.26 (95% CI 1.25-1.27) to 2.06 (95% CI 2.05-2.07). "
6234,2,"Moreover, both within and between hospitals, all 3 measures varied distinctly between days of the year, between days of the week, between weekdays and weekends, and between seasons."
6235,3,"While admissions and discharges drive capacity utilization and patient turnover variation, disease severity of each patient drives patient clinical complexity level. "
6236,3,"Monitoring-and, if possible, anticipating-daily care demand fluctuations is key to managing hospital pressure zones. "
6237,3,This study provides a pathway for identifying patients' daily exposure to strained hospital systems for a time-varying causal model.
6238,4,Using Infodemiology Metrics to Assess Public Interest in Liver Transplantation: Google Trends Analysis
6239,0,Liver transplantation (LT) is the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease. 
6240,0,"Less than 10% of global transplantation needs are met worldwide, and the need for LT is still increasing. "
6241,0,The death rates on the waiting list remain too high.
6242,1,"We performed a Google Trends search using the search terms liver transplantation and liver transplant on October 15, 2020. "
6243,1,"On the basis of the resulting monthly data, the annual average Google Trends indices were calculated for the years 2004 to 2018. "
6244,1,"We not only investigated the trend worldwide but also used data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), Spain, and Eurotransplant. "
6245,1,"Using pairwise Spearman correlations, Google Trends indices were examined over time and compared with the total number of liver transplants retrieved from the respective official websites of UNOS, the Organizacion Nacional de Trasplantes, and Eurotransplant."
6246,2,"From 2004 to 2018, there was a significant decrease in the worldwide Google Trends index from 78.2 in 2004 to 20.5 in 2018 (-71.2%). "
6247,2,This trend was more evident in UNOS than in the Eurotransplant group. 
6248,2,"In the same period, the number of transplanted livers increased worldwide. "
6249,2,The waiting list mortality rate was 31% for Eurotransplant and 29% for UNOS. 
6250,2,"However, in Spain, where there are excellent awareness programs, the Google Trends index remained stable over the years with comparable, increasing LT numbers but a significantly lower waiting list mortality (15%)."
6251,3,Public awareness in LT has decreased significantly over the past two decades. 
6252,3,"Therefore, novel awareness programs should be initialized."
6253,4,Chinese Patients Intention to Use Different Types of Internet Hospitals: Cross-sectional Study on Virtual Visits
6254,0,The issuing of regulation schemes and the expanding health insurance coverage for virtual visits of internet hospitals would incentivize Chinese providers and patients to use virtual visits tremendously. 
6255,0,China's internet hospitals vary in sponsorship. 
6256,0,"However, little is known about patients' intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals."
6257,1,A cross-sectional survey of 1653 participants was conducted in 3-tier hospitals in 3 cities with different income levels in May and June 2019. 
6258,1,Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors that affect patients' intention to use virtual visits. 
6259,1,"Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the determinants of the intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals (ie, enterprise-sponsored, hospital-sponsored, and government-sponsored)."
6260,2,"A total of 76.64% (1145/1494) of adult participants were online medical information seekers, and 87.06% (969/1113) of online medical information seekers had intention to use virtual visits. "
6261,2,"Public hospital-sponsored internet hospitals were the most prevalent ones among Chinese patients (473/894, 52.9%), followed by the provincial government internet hospital platform (238/894, 26.6%), digital health companies (116/894, 13.0%), medical e-commerce companies (48/894, 5.4%), private hospitals (13/894, 1.5%), and other companies (6/894, 0.7%). "
6262,2,"Gender, education, monthly income, and consumer type were significantly associated with the intention to use virtual visits. "
6263,2,"Gender, age, education, city income level, consumer type, and trust in the sponsor of a health website were significantly associated with the patient's intention to use virtual visits delivered by 3 different sponsorship types of internet hospitals."
6264,3,Chinese patients who were online medical information seekers had high intention to use virtual visits and had different intentions to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. 
6265,3,"Public hospitals, the government, and digital health companies were the top 3 sponsorship types of internet hospitals that patients had intention to use. "
6266,3,Trust in a health website sponsor significantly influenced the patient's intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. 
6267,3,"Gender, education, and consumer type were the factors significantly associated with both the intention to use virtual visits and the intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals."
6268,4,A Digital Intervention for Primary Care Practitioners to Support Antidepressant Discontinuation (Advisor for Health Professionals): Development Study
6269,0,"The number of people receiving antidepressants has increased in the past 3 decades, mainly because of people staying on them longer. "
6270,0,"However, in many cases long-term treatment is not evidence based and risks increasing side effects. "
6271,0,"Additionally, prompting general practitioners (GPs) to review medication does not improve the rate of appropriate discontinuation. "
6272,0,"Therefore, GPs and other health professionals may need help to support patients discontinuing antidepressants in primary care."
6273,1,"A prototype digital intervention called Advisor for Health Professionals (ADvisor HP) was planned and developed using theory, evidence, and a person-based approach. "
6274,1,"The following elements informed development: a literature review and qualitative synthesis, an in-depth qualitative study, the development of guiding principles for design elements, and theoretical behavioral analyses. "
6275,1,The intervention was then optimized through think-aloud qualitative interviews with health professionals while they were using the prototype intervention.
6276,2,Think-aloud qualitative interviews with 19 health professionals suggested that the digital intervention contained useful information and was readily accessible to practitioners. 
6277,2,The development work highlighted a need for further guidance on drug tapering schedules for practitioners and clarity about who is responsible for broaching the subject of discontinuation. 
6278,2,Practitioners highlighted the need to have information in easily and quickly accessible formats because of time constraints in day-to-day practice. 
6279,2,Some GPs felt that some information was already known to them but understood why this was included. 
6280,2,"Practitioners differed in their ideas about how they would use ADvisor HP in practice, with some preferring to read the resource in its entirety and others wanting to dip in and out as needed. "
6281,2,Changes were made to the wording and structure of the intervention in response to the feedback provided.
6282,3,"ADvisor HP is a digital intervention that has been developed using theory, evidence, and a person-based approach. "
6283,3,The optimization work suggests that practitioners may find this tool to be useful in supporting the reduction of long-term antidepressant use. 
6284,3,"Further quantitative and qualitative evaluation through a randomized controlled trial is needed to examine the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention."
6285,4,The Effects of Immersive Virtual Reality in Reducing Public Stigma of Mental Illness in the University Population of Hong Kong: Randomized Controlled Trial
6286,0,Public stigma in mental health often brings various adverse effects on people with mental illness. 
6287,0,Researchers have been developing different interventions in combating public stigma.
6288,1,A pre-post experimental design with a 1-week follow-up was conducted. 
6289,1,"Participants (N=206) were recruited through the mass mail system of The Chinese University of Hong Kong and randomized into 3 conditions: immersive animation, text, and control. "
6290,1,"In the immersive animation condition (n=72), participants experienced the simulation of daily life and the stigma experienced as an animated story protagonist with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder with IVR. "
6291,1,"In the text condition (n=65), participants experienced an identical story to the immersive animation condition with first-person audio narration using the same virtual reality headset. "
6292,1,"In the control condition (n=69), participants watched a video about planets with IVR. "
6293,1,All participants received interventions with a researcher-assisted Oculus Go virtual reality headset. 
6294,1,Participants' public stigma was measured through self-administered online questionnaires and compared across conditions and at different time points using repeated measures analysis of variance. 
6295,1,"Simple and sequential mediation analyses on the relationship of condition (immersive animation vs text) and follow-up public stigma with possible mediators, including sense of embodiment and story transportation, were conducted using PROCESS."
6296,2,Public stigma did not differ significantly across conditions at pre-experiment (P>.99). 
6297,2,"In the immersive animation and text conditions, public stigma was significantly reduced at postexperiment and at the 1-week follow-up compared to pre-experiment (all with P<.001). "
6298,2,Public stigma in the control condition at postexperiment and follow-up remained unchanged compared with pre-experiment (P=.69). 
6299,2,Immersive animation had significantly lower public stigma than the control at postexperiment (P=.003) and follow-up (P=.02). 
6300,2,Text also had lower public stigma than the control at postexperiment (P=.007) and follow-up (P=.03). 
6301,2,"However, immersive animation did not significantly differ from text in public stigma at postexperiment and follow-up (both P>.99). "
6302,2,"In simple mediation models, both sense of embodiment (95% CI -0.22 to 0.46) and story transportation (95% CI -0.18 to 0.00) were not significant mediators. "
6303,2,"In the sequential mediation model, both sense of embodiment and story transportation were significant sequential mediators. "
6304,2,"Sense of embodiment was positively associated with story transportation (P<.001), while story transportation was negatively associated with public stigma (P<.001). "
6305,2,The indirect effect of the sequential mediation model was significant (95% CI -0.38 to -0.11).
6306,3,This study provides novel findings and a rigorous comparison in understanding the effects of IVR on public stigma. 
6307,3,The findings showed that IVR and text with audio narration performed similarly and significantly in stigma reduction. 
6308,3,Sense of embodiment and story transportation were found to be sequentially associated with public stigma reduction.
6309,4,Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Interventions for Adolescent Patients in Hospital Settings: Systematic Review
6310,0,"Given the high level of interest and increasing familiarity with virtual reality among adolescents, there is great potential to use virtual reality to address adolescents' unique health care delivery needs while in hospital. "
6311,0,"While there have been reviews on the use of virtual reality for specific health conditions and procedures, none to date have reviewed the full scope of virtual reality hospital interventions for adolescents who are often combined with children as a homogenous group, despite the fact that adolescents experience virtual environments different from children."
6312,1,"PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, and Scopus databases were searched using keywords and phrases. "
6313,1,"Retrieved abstracts (n=1525) were double screened, yielding 276 articles for full-text screening. "
6314,1,"Of these, 8 articles met inclusion criteria. "
6315,1,"Data were extracted to a standardized coding sheet, and a narrative synthesis was performed due to the heterogeneity of the studies."
6316,2,"Four RCTs and 4 single-case reports were identified for inclusion, all of which aimed to reduce pain or anxiety. "
6317,2,"The scenarios targeted were burn pain, venipuncture, chemotherapy, preoperative anxiety, and palliative care. "
6318,2,"Three out of 4 RCTs found significant reductions in pain or anxiety outcomes measures when using virtual reality compared to standard care or other distraction techniques; however, only 1 study combined self-reported experiences of pain or anxiety with any physiological measures. "
6319,2,"Single-case reports relied primarily upon qualitative feedback, with patients reporting reduced pain or anxiety and a preference for virtual reality to no virtual reality."
6320,3,"Virtual reality can provide a safe and engaging way to reduce pain and anxiety in adolescents while in hospital, particularly when virtual reality software is highly immersive and specifically designed for therapeutic purposes. "
6321,3,"As VR becomes more accessible and affordable for use in hospitals, larger and more diverse studies that capitalize on adolescents' interest in and aptitude for virtual reality, and on the full range of capabilities of this emerging technology, are needed to build on these promising results."
6322,4,Team Science in Precision Medicine: Study of Coleadership and Coauthorship Across Health Organizations
6323,0,"Interdisciplinary collaborations bring lots of benefits to researchers in multiple areas, including precision medicine."
6324,1,Publications of organizations on the eHealth Catalogue of Activities were collected in 2015 and 2017. 
6325,1,The significance of the correlation between coleadership and coauthorship among different organizations was calculated using the Pearson chi-square test of independence. 
6326,1,Other nonparametric tests examined whether organizations with coleaders publish more and better papers than organizations without coleaders.
6327,2,"A total of 374 publications from 69 organizations were analyzed in 2015, and 7064 papers from 87 organizations were analyzed in 2017. "
6328,2,"Organizations with coleadership published more papers (P<.001, 2015 and 2017), which received higher citations (Z=-13.547, p<.001, 2017), compared to those without coleadership. "
6329,2,"Organizations with coleaders tended to publish papers together (P<.001, 2015 and 2017)."
6330,3,Our findings suggest that organizations in the field of precision medicine could greatly benefit from institutional-level team science. 
6331,3,"As a result, stronger collaboration is recommended."
6332,4,Neighborhood Broadband and Use of Telehealth Among Older Adults: Cross-sectional Study of National Survey Data Linked With Census Data
6333,0,The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the role of telehealth in health care delivery. 
6334,0,"Regional variation in internet access and telehealth use are well-documented, but the effect of neighborhood factors, including the pervasiveness of broadband internet, on older adults' telehealth usage in the context of internet access is not known."
6335,1,"In this cross-sectional study, we included 5117 community-living older adults aged >= 65 years, who participated in the 2017 National Health and Aging Trends Study with census tract-level data for participants' places of residence from the American Community Survey."
6336,2,"Of an estimated 35.3 million community-living older adults, 21.1 million (59.7%) were internet users, and of this group, more than one-third (35.8%) engaged in telehealth. "
6337,2,"In a multivariable regression model adjusted for individual- and neighborhood-level factors, age, education, income, and the pervasiveness of neighborhood broadband internet subscription were associated with engagement in telehealth, while race, health, county metropolitan status, and neighborhood social deprivation were not. "
6338,2,"Among internet users, living in a neighborhood at the lowest (versus highest) tertile of broadband internet subscription was associated with being 40% less likely to engage in telehealth (adjusted odds ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-0.87), all else equal."
6339,3,Neighborhood broadband internet stands out as a mutable characteristic that is consequential to engagement in telehealth.
6340,4,A Web-Based Time-Use Application to Assess Diet and Movement Behavior in Asian Schoolchildren: Development and Usability Study of My E-Diary for Activities and Lifestyle (MEDAL)
6341,0,"Web-based time-use diaries for schoolchildren are limited, and existing studies focus mostly on capturing physical activities and sedentary behaviors but less comprehensively on dietary behaviors."
6342,1,"MEDAL was developed through formative research and an iterative user-centric design approach involving small groups of schoolchildren (ranging from n=5 to n=15, aged 7-13 years). "
6343,1,"To test the usability, children aged 10-11 years were recruited from 2 primary schools in Singapore to complete MEDAL for 2 weekdays and 2 weekend days and complete a 10-item usability questionnaire."
6344,2,The development process revealed that younger children (aged <9 years) were less able to complete MEDAL independently. 
6345,2,"Of the 204 participants (118/204, 57.8% boys, and 31/201, 15.4% overweight) in the usability study, 57.8% (118/204) completed 3 to 4 days of recording, whereas the rest recorded for 2 days or less. "
6346,2,The median time taken to complete MEDAL was 14.2 minutes per day. 
6347,2,"The majority of participants agreed that instructions were clear (193/203, 95.1%), that MEDAL was easy to use (173/203, 85.2%), that they liked the application (172/202, 85.1%), and that they preferred recording their activities on the web than on paper (167/202, 82.7%). "
6348,2,"Among all the factors evaluated, recording for 4 days was the least satisfactory component reported. "
6349,2,"Compared with boys, girls reported better recall ability and agreed that the time spent on completing 1-day entry was appropriate."
6350,3,"MEDAL appears to be a feasible application to capture diet and movement behaviors in children aged 10-12 years, particularly in the Asian context. "
6351,3,"Some gender differences in usability performance were observed, but the majority of the participants had a positive experience using MEDAL. "
6352,3,The validation of the data collected through the application is in progress.
6353,4,The Accuracy of Wrist Skin Temperature in Detecting Ovulation Compared to Basal Body Temperature: Prospective Comparative Diagnostic Accuracy Study
6354,0,"As a daily point measurement, basal body temperature (BBT) might not be able to capture the temperature shift in the menstrual cycle because a single temperature measurement is present on the sliding scale of the circadian rhythm. "
6355,0,Wrist skin temperature measured continuously during sleep has the potential to overcome this limitation.
6356,1,This prospective study included 193 cycles (170 ovulatory and 23 anovulatory) collected from 57 healthy women. 
6357,1,Participants wore a wearable device (Ava Fertility Tracker bracelet 2.0) that continuously measured the wrist skin temperature during sleep. 
6358,1,Daily BBT was measured orally and immediately upon waking up using a computerized fertility tracker with a digital thermometer (Lady-Comp). 
6359,1,An at-home luteinizing hormone test was used as the reference standard for ovulation. 
6360,1,The diagnostic accuracy of using at least one temperature shift detected by the two temperatures in detecting ovulation was evaluated. 
6361,1,"For ovulatory cycles, repeated measures correlation was used to examine the correlation between the two temperatures, and mixed effect models were used to determine the agreement between the two temperature curves at different menstrual phases."
6362,2,"Wrist skin temperature was more sensitive than BBT (sensitivity 0.62 vs 0.23; P<.001) and had a higher true-positive rate (54.9% vs 20.2%) for detecting ovulation; however, it also had a higher false-positive rate (8.8% vs 3.6%), resulting in lower specificity (0.26 vs 0.70; P=.002). "
6363,2,The probability that ovulation occurred when at least one temperature shift was detected was 86.2% for wrist skin temperature and 84.8% for BBT. 
6364,2,Both temperatures had low negative predictive values (8.8% for wrist skin temperature and 10.9% for BBT). 
6365,2,Significant positive correlation between the two temperatures was only found in the follicular phase (rmcorr correlation coefficient=0.294; P=.001). 
6366,2,Both temperatures increased during the postovulatory phase with a greater increase in the wrist skin temperature (range of increase: 0.50 degrees C vs 0.20 degrees C). 
6367,2,"During the menstrual phase, the wrist skin temperature exhibited a greater and more rapid decrease (from 36.13 degrees C to 35.80 degrees C) than BBT (from 36.31 degrees C to 36.27 degrees C). "
6368,2,"During the preovulatory phase, there were minimal changes in both temperatures and small variations in the estimated daily difference between the two temperatures, indicating an agreement between the two curves."
6369,3,"For women interested in maximizing the chances of pregnancy, wrist skin temperature continuously measured during sleep is more sensitive than BBT for detecting ovulation. "
6370,3,The difference in the diagnostic accuracy of these methods was likely attributed to the greater temperature increase in the postovulatory phase and greater temperature decrease during the menstrual phase for the wrist skin temperatures.
6371,4,Coping Styles for Mediating the Effect of Resilience on Depression Among Medical Students in Web-Based Classes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study
6372,0,"Due to strict, nationwide, comprehensive COVID-19 protective measures, including home quarantine, all Chinese medical students began taking web-based classes beginning in the spring semester of 2020. "
6373,0,"Home quarantine, web-based classes, and the stress surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may have triggered an increased incidence of mental health problems among medical students. "
6374,0,"Although there have been increasing amounts of literature on depression among medical students, studies focusing on positive psychological resources, such as resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, still need to be expanded."
6375,1,"A cross-sectional study of 666 medical students involving stratified sampling in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, was completed between March 20 and April 10, 2020. "
6376,1,"The participants responded to a self-administered, smartphone-based questionnaire, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and Ego Resilience 89 Scale. "
6377,1,Hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modeling were used in this study.
6378,2,The prevalence of depression among the participants was 9.6% (64/666) in this study. 
6379,2,"The regression analysis revealed that grade (the year in which the medical student was in training) (P=.013), how well students adapted to web-based classes (P<.001), their levels of resilience (P=.04), and their coping styles were independent predictors for depression (P<.001). "
6380,2,"Resilience and positive coping styles were negatively related to depression (resilience: P=.04; positive coping styles: P<.001), and negative coping styles were positively related to depression (P<.001). "
6381,2,The structural equation modeling analysis showed that the effect of resilience on depression was partially mediated by coping styles (P=.007).
6382,3,"In this study, it was found that the prevalence of depression was slightly low and coping styles mediated the association between resilience and depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. "
6383,3,These findings have significant implications for future studies. 
6384,3,Future studies and interventions should aim to improve resilience and promote positive coping styles.
6385,4,Emotional Reactions to Cybersecurity Breach Situations: Scenario-Based Survey Study
6386,0,"With the ever-expanding interconnectedness of the internet and especially with the recent development of the Internet of Things, people are increasingly at risk for cybersecurity breaches that can have far-reaching consequences for their personal and professional lives, with psychological and mental health ramifications."
6387,1,A total of 902 participants from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands reported their emotion processes triggered by a cybersecurity breach scenario. 
6388,1,"Moreover, they reported on their Big Five personality traits, as well as on key indicators for resilient, overcontrolling (internalizing problems), and undercontrolling (aggression) personality types."
6389,2,"Principal component analyses revealed a clear 3-dimensional structure of emotion processes: emotional intensity, proactive versus fight/flight reactions, and affective versus cognitive/motivational reactions. "
6390,2,"Regression analyses revealed that more internalizing problems (beta=.33, P<.001), resilience (beta=.22, P<.001), and agreeableness (beta=.12, P<.001) and less emotional stability (beta=-.25, P<.001) have significant predictive value for higher emotional intensity. "
6391,2,"More internalizing problems (beta=.26, P<.001), aggression (beta=.25, P<.001), and extraversion (beta=.07, P=.01) and less resilience (beta=-.19, P<.001), agreeableness (beta=-.34, P<.001), consciousness (beta=-.19, P<.001), and openness (beta=-.22, P<.001) have significant predictive value for comparatively more fight/flight than proactive reactions. "
6392,2,"Less internalizing problems (beta=-.32, P<.001) and more emotional stability (beta=.14, P<.001) and aggression (beta=.13, P<.001) have significant predictive value for a comparatively higher salience for cognitive/motivational than affective reactions."
6393,3,"To adequately describe the emotion processes triggered by a cybersecurity breach, two more dimensions are needed over and above the general negative affectivity dimension. "
6394,3,This multidimensional structure is further supported by the differential relationships of the emotion dimensions with personality characteristics. 
6395,3,The discovered emotion structure could be used for consistent predictions about who is at risk to develop long-term mental well-being issues due to a cybersecurity breach experience.
6396,4,Peoples Willingness to Vaccinate Against COVID-19 Despite Their Safety Concerns: Twitter Poll Analysis
6397,0,"On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization's Emergency Committee declared the rapid, worldwide spread of COVID-19 a global health emergency. "
6398,0,"Since then, tireless efforts have been made to mitigate the spread of the disease and its impact, and these efforts have mostly relied on nonpharmaceutical interventions. "
6399,0,"By December 2020, the safety and efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines were demonstrated. "
6400,0,"The large social media platform Twitter has been used by medical researchers for the analysis of important public health topics, such as the public's perception on antibiotic use and misuse and human papillomavirus vaccination. "
6401,0,"The analysis of Twitter-generated data can be further facilitated by using Twitter's built-in, anonymous polling tool to gain insight into public health issues and obtain rapid feedback on an international scale. "
6402,0,"During the fast-paced course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Twitter polling system has provided a viable method for gaining rapid, large-scale, international public health insights on highly relevant and timely SARS-CoV-2-related topics."
6403,1,We developed 2 Twitter polls to explore the public's views on available COVID-19 vaccines. 
6404,1,"The surveys were pinned to the Digital Health and Patient Safety Platform Twitter timeline for 1 week in mid-February 2021, and Twitter users and influencers were asked to participate in and retweet the polls to reach the largest possible audience."
6405,2,"The adequacy of COVID-19 vaccine safety (ie, the safety of currently available vaccines; poll 1) was agreed upon by 1579 out of 3439 (45.9%) Twitter users. "
6406,2,"In contrast, almost as many Twitter users (1434/3439, 41.7%) were unsure about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. "
6407,2,Only 5.2% (179/3439) of Twitter users rated the available COVID-19 vaccines as generally unsafe. 
6408,2,"Poll 2, which addressed the question of whether users would undergo vaccination, was answered affirmatively by 82.8% (2862/3457) of Twitter users, and only 8% (277/3457) categorically rejected vaccination at the time of polling."
6409,3,"In contrast to the perceived high level of uncertainty about the safety of the available COVID-19 vaccines, we observed an elevated willingness to undergo vaccination among our study sample. "
6410,3,"Since people's perceptions and views are strongly influenced by social media, the snapshots provided by these media platforms represent a static image of a moving target. "
6411,3,"Thus, the results of this study need to be followed up by long-term surveys to maintain their validity. "
6412,3,"This is especially relevant due to the circumstances of the fast-paced pandemic and the need to not miss sudden rises in the incidence of vaccine hesitancy, which may have detrimental effects on the pandemic's course."
6413,4,Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-Based Quality Information Exchange for Clinical Next-Generation Sequencing Genomic Testing: Implementation Study
6414,0,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been rapidly adopted in clinical practice, with the scope extended to early diagnosis, disease classification, and treatment planning. "
6415,0,"As the number of requests for NGS genomic testing increases, substantial efforts have been made to deliver the testing results clearly and unambiguously. "
6416,0,"For the legitimacy of clinical NGS genomic testing, quality information from the process of producing genomic data should be included within the results. "
6417,0,"However, most reports provide insufficient quality information to confirm the reliability of genomic testing owing to the complexity of the NGS process."
6418,1,"We defined data elements for the exchange of quality information from clinical NGS genomic tests, and profiled a FHIR genomic resource to enable information exchange in a standardized format. "
6419,1,"We then developed the FHIR-based web app and FHIR server to exchange quality information, along with statistical analysis tools implemented with the R Shiny server."
6420,2,Approximately 1000 experimental data entries collected from the targeted sequencing pipeline CancerSCAN designed by Samsung Medical Center were used to validate implementation of the NGS-QR app using real-world data. 
6421,2,The user can share the quality information of NGS genomic testing and verify the quality status of individual samples in the overall distribution.
6422,3,This study successfully demonstrated how quality information of clinical NGS genomic testing can be exchanged in a standardized format. 
6423,3,"As the demand for NGS genomic testing in clinical settings increases and genomic data accumulate, quality information can be used as reference material to improve the quality of testing. "
6424,3,This app could also motivate laboratories to perform diagnostic tests to provide high-quality genomic data.
6425,4,Navigating the Credibility of Web-Based Information During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Using Mnemonics to Empower the Public to Spot Red Flags in Health Information on the Internet
6426,0,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals have been directly confronted with the suffering of patients and their families. "
6427,0,"By making them main actors in the management of this health crisis, they have been exposed to various psychosocial risks (stress, trauma, fatigue, etc). "
6428,0,"Paradoxically, stress-related symptoms are often underreported in this vulnerable population but are potentially detectable through passive monitoring of changes in speech behavior."
6429,1,"Speech samples from 89 health care professionals were collected over the phone during positive, negative, and neutral storytelling tasks; various voice features were extracted and compared with classical stress measures via standard questionnaires. "
6430,1,"Additionally, a regression analysis was performed."
6431,2,"Certain speech characteristics correlated with stress levels in both genders; mainly, spectral (ie, formant) features, such as the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient, and prosodic characteristics, such as the fundamental frequency, appeared to be sensitive to stress. "
6432,2,"Overall, for both male and female participants, using vocal features from the positive tasks for regression yielded the most accurate prediction results of stress scores (mean absolute error 5.31)."
6433,3,Automatic speech analysis could help with early detection of subtle signs of stress in vulnerable populations over the phone. 
6434,3,"By combining the use of this technology with timely intervention strategies, it could contribute to the prevention of burnout and the development of comorbidities, such as depression or anxiety."
6435,4,Prediction Models for the Clinical Severity of Patients With COVID-19 in Korea: Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study
6436,0,Limited information is available about the present characteristics and dynamic clinical changes that occur in patients with COVID-19 during the early phase of the illness.
6437,1,"This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients with COVID-19 who were released from quarantine until April 30, 2020, in Korea. "
6438,1,"A total of 5628 patients were included in the training and testing cohorts to train and validate the models that predict clinical severity and the duration of hospitalization, and the clinical severity score was defined at four levels: mild, moderate, severe, and critical."
6439,2,"Out of a total of 5601 patients, 4455 (79.5%), 330 (5.9%), 512 (9.1%), and 301 (5.4%) were included in the mild, moderate, severe, and critical levels, respectively. "
6440,2,"As risk factors for predicting critical patients, we selected older age, shortness of breath, a high white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, a low lymphocyte count, and a low platelet count. "
6441,2,We developed 3 prediction models to classify clinical severity levels. 
6442,2,"For example, the prediction model with 6 variables yielded a predictive power of >0.93 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. "
6443,2,"We developed a web-based nomogram, using these models."
6444,3,"Our prediction models, along with the web-based nomogram, are expected to be useful for the assessment of the onset of severe and critical illness among patients with COVID-19 and triage patients upon hospital admission."
6445,4,Characteristics of Online Health Care Services From Chinas Largest Online Medical Platform: Cross-sectional Survey Study
6446,0,"Internet hospitals in China are in great demand due to limited and unevenly distributed health care resources, lack of family doctors, increased burdens of chronic diseases, and rapid growth of the aged population. "
6447,0,The COVID-19 epidemic catalyzed the expansion of online health care services. 
6448,0,"In recent years, internet hospitals have been rapidly developed. "
6449,0,"Ping An Good Doctor is the largest, national online medical entry point in China and is a widely used platform providing online health care services."
6450,1,"A total of 35.3 million consultations and inquisitions over the course of 1 year were analyzed with respect to the distributions of departments and diseases, user profiles, and consulting behaviors."
6451,2,"The geographical distribution of the usage of Ping An Good Doctor showed that Shandong (18.4%), Yunnan (15.6%), Shaanxi (7.2%), and Guangdong (5.5%) were the provinces that used it the most; they accounted for 46.6% of the total consultations and inquisitions. "
6452,2,"In terms of department distribution, we found that gynecology and obstetrics (19.2%), dermatology (17.0%), and pediatrics (14.4%) were the top three departments in Ping An Good Doctor. "
6453,2,"The disease distribution analysis showed that, except for nondisease-specific consultations, acute upper respiratory infection (AURI) (4.1%), pregnancy (2.8%), and dermatitis (2.4%) were the most frequently consulted diseases. "
6454,2,"In terms of user profiles, females (60.4%) from 19 to 35 years of age were most likely to seek consultations online, in general. "
6455,2,"The user behavior analyses showed that the peak times of day for online consultations occurred at 10 AM, 3 PM, and 9 PM. "
6456,2,"Regarding user experience, 93.0% of users gave full marks following their consultations. "
6457,2,"For some disease-related health problems, such as AURI, dermatitis, and eczema, the feedback scores were above average."
6458,3,"The prevalence of internet hospitals, such as Ping An Good Doctor, illustrated the great demand for online health care services that can go beyond geographical limitations. "
6459,3,Our analyses showed that nondisease-specific issues and moderate health problems were much more frequently consulted about than severe clinical conditions. 
6460,3,"This indicated that internet hospitals played the role of the family doctor, which helped to relieve the stress placed on offline hospitals and facilitated people's lives. "
6461,3,"In addition, good user experiences, especially regarding disease-related inquisitions, suggested that online health services can help solve health problems. "
6462,3,"With support from the government and acceptance by the public, online health care services could develop at a fast pace and greatly benefit people's daily lives."
6463,4,Applying A/B Testing to Clinical Decision Support: Rapid Randomized Controlled Trials
6464,0,Clinical decision support (CDS) is a valuable feature of electronic health records (EHRs) designed to improve quality and safety. 
6465,0,"However, due to the complexities of system design and inconsistent results, CDS tools may inadvertently increase alert fatigue and contribute to physician burnout. "
6466,0,"A/B testing, or rapid-cycle randomized tests, is a useful method that can be applied to the EHR in order to rapidly understand and iteratively improve design choices embedded within CDS tools."
6467,1,"A multistep process combining tools from user-centered design, A/B testing, and implementation science was used to understand, ideate, prototype, test, analyze, and improve each candidate CDS. "
6468,1,"CDS engagement metrics (alert views, acceptance rates) were used to evaluate which CDS version is superior."
6469,2,"To demonstrate the impact of the process, 2 experiments are highlighted. "
6470,2,"First, after multiple rounds of usability testing, a revised CDS influenza alert was tested against usual care CDS in a rapid (similar to 6 weeks) RCT. "
6471,2,"The new alert text resulted in minimal impact on reducing firings per patients per day, but this failure triggered another round of review that identified key technical improvements (ie, removal of dismissal button and firings in procedural areas) that led to a dramatic decrease in firings per patient per day (23.1 to 7.3). "
6472,2,"In the second experiment, the process was used to test 3 versions (financial, quality, regulatory) of text supporting tobacco cessation alerts as well as 3 supporting images. "
6473,2,"Based on 3 rounds of RCTs, there was no significant difference in acceptance rates based on the framing of the messages or addition of images."
6474,3,"These experiments support the potential for this new process to rapidly develop, deploy, and rigorously evaluate CDS within an EHR. "
6475,3,We also identified important considerations in applying these methods. 
6476,3,This approach may be an important tool for improving the impact of and experience with CDS.
6477,4,Mobile HIV Testing Through Social Networking Platforms: Comparative Study
6478,0,Improving HIV screening in key populations is a crucial strategy to achieve the goal of eliminating AIDS in 2030. 
6479,0,Social networking platforms can be used to recruit high risk-taking men who have sex with men (MSM) to promote the delivery of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) as mobile HIV testing. 
6480,0,"Therefore, client recruitment and availability of mobile HIV testing through social networking platforms requires further evaluation."
6481,1,A comparative study design and propensity score matching was applied. 
6482,1,"The traditional VCT model, that is, the control group, recruited MSM through a website, and a trained research assistant visited the walk-in testing station at a gay village on Friday and Saturday nights. "
6483,1,"The social networking VCT model, the experimental group, recruited MSM from social networking platforms by periodically reloading into and conducting web-based discussions on dating apps and Facebook. "
6484,1,The participants then referred to others in their social networks via a popular messenger app in Taiwan. 
6485,1,The test was conducted at a designated time and place during weekdays by a trained research assistant. 
6486,1,"Across both modes of contact, before the mobile HIV testing, participants needed to provide demographic characteristics and respond to a questionnaire about HIV risk-taking behaviors."
6487,2,"We recruited 831 MSM over 6 months, with a completion rate of 8.56% (616/7200) in the traditional VCT model and 20.71% (215/1038) in the social networking VCT model. "
6488,2,"After propensity score matching, there were 215 MSM in each group (mean age 29.97, SD 7.61 years). "
6489,2,"The social networking model was more likely to reach MSM with HIV risk-taking behaviors, that is, those seeking sexual activity through social media, having multiple sexual partners and unprotected anal intercourse, having experience of recreational drug use, and never having or not regularly having an HIV test, compared with the traditional model. "
6490,2,"HIV positive rates (incidence rate ratio 3.40, 95% CI 1.089-10.584; P=.03) and clinic referral rates (incidence rate ratio 0.03, 95% CI 0.001-0.585; P=.006) were significantly higher among those in the social networking VCT model than in the traditional VCT model."
6491,3,"Through effective recruitment strategies on social networking platforms, the social networking VCT mode can be smoothly promoted, as compared with the traditional VCT model, to target high risk-taking MSM and increase testing outcomes."
6492,4,Immersive Virtual Reality and Ocular Tracking for Brain Mapping During Awake Surgery: Prospective Evaluation Study
6493,0,Language mapping during awake brain surgery is currently a standard procedure. 
6494,0,"However, mapping is rarely performed for other cognitive functions that are important for social interaction, such as visuospatial cognition and nonverbal language, including facial expressions and eye gaze. "
6495,0,The main reason for this omission is the lack of tasks that are fully compatible with the restrictive environment of an operating room and awake brain surgery procedures.
6496,1,We recruited 15 patients with brain tumors near language and/or motor areas. 
6497,1,"Language mapping was performed with a naming task, DO 80, presented on a computer tablet and then in 2D and 3D via the VRH. "
6498,1,Patients were also immersed in a visuospatial and social VR experience.
6499,2,"None of the patients experienced VR sickness, whereas 2 patients had an intraoperative focal seizure without consequence; there was no reason to attribute these seizures to virtual reality headset use. "
6500,2,The patients were able to perform the VR tasks. 
6501,2,"Eye tracking was functional, enabling the medical team to analyze the patients' attention and exploration of the visual field of the virtual reality headset directly."
6502,3,"We found that it is possible and safe to immerse the patient in an interactive virtual environment during awake brain surgery, paving the way for new VR-based brain mapping procedures."
6503,4,Basic Medical Training for Refugees via Collaborative Blended Learning: Quasi-Experimental Design
6504,0,"Globally, there is an excess of 68.5 million people who have been forced to leave their homes and seek sanctuary elsewhere because of poverty, persecution, conflict, violence, and human rights violations. "
6505,0,"Although international humanitarian responses usually focus on ensuring that the basic needs of these people are being met, there is growing attention on the role that development-oriented interventions can play in the longer term. "
6506,0,Higher education in a refugee context is one such intervention that can equip refugees with the knowledge and skills they need to serve their communities and move forward.
6507,1,We used a quasi-experimental design to compare the posttest scores of both inequivalent student groups: control group (n=18) and intervention group (n=16). 
6508,1,"Factors that influenced refugee students' knowledge acquisition, the amount of knowledge they acquired, and their academic outcomes were assessed, and the pedagogical evolution of the project is presented."
6509,2,We found that the Kakuma intervention course yielded better outcomes and was more effective in terms of learning than the Dadaab control course. 
6510,2,"Of the 16 students who took part in the intervention course, 10 (63%) completed the program successfully and received accreditation from the University of Geneva. "
6511,2,We observed that they received new knowledge well and scored higher on all learning modalities than those in the control course. 
6512,2,"Comparison of written and oral examinations between the courses showed statistical significance for the intervention group in written and oral exams (two-tailed: P=.006 and P=.05; one-tailed: P=.003 and P=.03, respectively). "
6513,2,"The Kakuma course was not effective in addressing electricity and internet access problems, nor in reducing the challenge of tight deadlines in the syllabus. "
6514,2,"Pedagogical adjustments to the intervention course improved student involvement, with higher participation rates in quizzes (10/11, 91%), and overall satisfaction and learning."
6515,3,"The intervention group-with an improved mode of delivery, better contextualized content, and further interaction-reached a higher level of medical knowledge acquisition and developed more complex questions on medical topics than the control group. "
6516,3,"The positive outcome of this project shows that given the right resources and support, refugees can contribute to the improvement and development of health care in their communities. "
6517,3,"Nonetheless, a more focused effort is necessary to meet the educational needs of refugee learners and better understand their living conditions."
6518,4,"Short-Range Forecasting of COVID-19 During Early Onset at County, Health District, and State Geographic Levels Using Seven Methods: Comparative Forecasting Study"
6519,0,Forecasting methods rely on trends and averages of prior observations to forecast COVID-19 case counts. 
6520,0,"COVID-19 forecasts have received much media attention, and numerous platforms have been created to inform the public. "
6521,0,"However, forecasting effectiveness varies by geographic scope and is affected by changing assumptions in behaviors and preventative measures in response to the pandemic. "
6522,0,"Due to time requirements for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, evidence is needed to inform short-term forecasting method selection at county, health district, and state levels."
6523,1,"We created 1-, 3-, and 7-day forecasts at the county, health district, and state levels using (1) a naive approach, (2) Holt-Winters (HW) exponential smoothing, (3) a growth rate approach, (4) a moving average (MA) approach, (5) an autoregressive (AR) approach, (6) an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) approach, and (7) an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach. "
6524,1,"Forecasts relied on Virginia's 3464 historical county-level cumulative case counts from March 7 to April 22, 2020, as reported by The New York Times. "
6525,1,"Statistically significant results were identified using 95% CIs of median absolute error (MdAE) and median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) metrics of the resulting 216,698 forecasts."
6526,2,"The next-day MA forecast with 3-day look-back length obtained the lowest MdAE (median 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.84, P<.001) and statistically significantly differed from 39 out of 59 alternatives (66%) to 53 out of 59 alternatives (90%) at each geographic level at a significance level of .01. "
6527,2,"For short-range forecasting, methods assuming stationary means of prior days' counts outperformed methods with assumptions of weak stationarity or nonstationarity means. "
6528,2,MdAPE results revealed statistically significant differences across geographic levels.
6529,3,"For short-range COVID-19 cumulative case count forecasting at the county, health district, and state levels during early onset, the following were found: (1) the MA method was effective for forecasting 1-, 3-, and 7-day cumulative case counts; (2) exponential growth was not the best representation of case growth during early virus onset when the public was aware of the virus; and (3) geographic resolution was a factor in the selection of forecasting methods."
6530,4,"Implementation of the Operating Room Black Box Research Program at the Ottawa Hospital Through Patient, Clinical, and Organizational Engagement: Case Study"
6531,0,"A large proportion of surgical patient harm is preventable; yet, our ability to systematically learn from these incidents and improve clinical practice remains limited. "
6532,0,The Operating Room Black Box was developed to address the need for comprehensive assessments of clinical performance in the operating room. 
6533,0,"It captures synchronized audio, video, patient, and environmental clinical data in real time, which are subsequently analyzed by a combination of expert raters and software-based algorithms. "
6534,0,"Despite its significant potential to facilitate research and practice improvement, there are many potential implementation challenges at the institutional, clinician, and patient level. "
6535,0,This paper summarizes our approach to implementation of the Operating Room Black Box at a large academic Canadian center.
6536,1,"Our implementation approach included seeking support from hospital leadership; building frontline support and a team of champions among patients, nurses, anesthesiologists, and surgeons; accounting for stakeholder perceptions using theory-informed qualitative interviews; engaging patients; and documenting the implementation process, including barriers and facilitators, using the consolidated framework for implementation research."
6537,2,"During the 12-month implementation period, we conducted 23 stakeholder engagement activities with over 200 participants. "
6538,2,"We recruited 10 clinician champions representing nursing, anesthesia, and surgery. "
6539,2,We formally interviewed 15 patients and 17 perioperative clinicians and identified key themes to include in an information campaign run as part of the implementation process. 
6540,2,Two patient partners were engaged and advised on communications as well as grant and protocol development. 
6541,2,Many anticipated and unanticipated challenges were encountered at all levels. 
6542,2,"Implementation was ultimately successful, with the Operating Room Black Box installed in August 2018, and data collection beginning shortly thereafter."
6543,3,This paper represents the first step toward evidence-guided implementation of technologies for direct observation of performance for research and quality improvement in surgery. 
6544,3,"With technology increasingly being used in health care settings, the health care community should aim to optimize implementation processes in the best interest of health care professionals and patients."
6545,4,An 11-Item Measure of User- and Human-Centered Design for Personal Health Tools (UCD-11): Development and Validation
6546,0,Researchers developing personal health tools employ a range of approaches to involve prospective users in design and development.
6547,1,We conducted a psychometric analysis of data from a previous systematic review of the design and development processes of 348 personal health tools. 
6548,1,"Using a conceptual framework of user-centered design, our team of patients, caregivers, health professionals, tool developers, and researchers analyzed how specific practices in tool design and development might be combined and used as a measure. "
6549,1,"We prioritized variables according to their importance within the conceptual framework and validated the resultant measure using principal component analysis with Varimax rotation, classical item analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis."
6550,2,We retained 11 items in a 3-factor structure explaining 68% of the variance in the data. 
6551,2,The Cronbach alpha was .72. 
6552,2,Confirmatory factor analysis supported our hypothesis of a latent construct of user-centeredness. 
6553,2,"Items were whether or not: (1) patient, family, caregiver, or surrogate users were involved in the steps that help tool developers understand users or (2) develop a prototype, (3) asked their opinions, (4) observed using the tool or (5) involved in steps intended to evaluate the tool, (6) the process had 3 or more iterative cycles, (7) changes between cycles were explicitly reported, (8) health professionals were asked their opinion and (9) consulted before the first prototype was developed or (10) between initial and final prototypes, and (11) a panel of other experts was involved."
6554,3,The User-Centered Design 11-item measure (UCD-11) may be used to quantitatively document the user/human-centeredness of design and development processes of patient-centered tools. 
6555,3,"By building an evidence base about such processes, we can help ensure that tools are adapted to people who will use them, rather than requiring people to adapt to tools."
6556,4,"Understanding Concerns, Sentiments, and Disparities Among Population Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic Via Twitter Data Mining: Large-scale Cross-sectional Study"
6557,0,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, its far-reaching impacts have been witnessed globally across all aspects of human life, such as health, economy, politics, and education. "
6558,0,"Such widely penetrating impacts cast significant and profound burdens on all population groups, incurring varied concerns and sentiments among them."
6559,1,"This study consisted of three steps: first, tweets posted during the pandemic were collected and preprocessed on a large scale; second, the key population attributes, concerns, sentiments, and emotions were extracted via a collection of natural language processing procedures; third, multiple analyses were conducted to reveal concerns, sentiments, and disparities among population groups during the pandemic. "
6560,1,"Overall, this study implemented a quick, effective, and economical approach for analyzing population-level disparities during a public health event. "
6561,1,The source code developed in this study was released for free public use at GitHub.
6562,2,"A total of 1,015,655 original English tweets posted from August 7 to 12, 2020, were acquired and analyzed to obtain the following results. "
6563,2,"Organizations were significantly more concerned about COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 3.48, 95% CI 3.39-3.58) and expressed more fear and depression emotions than individuals. "
6564,2,"Females were less concerned about COVID-19 (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.71-0.75) and expressed less fear and depression emotions than males. "
6565,2,"Among all age groups (ie, <= 18, 19-29, 30-39, and >= 40 years of age), the attention ORs of COVID-19 fear and depression increased significantly with age. "
6566,2,It is worth noting that not all females paid less attention to COVID-19 than males. 
6567,2,"In the age group of 40 years or older, females were more concerned than males, especially regarding the economic and education topics. "
6568,2,"In addition, males 40 years or older and 18 years or younger were the least positive. "
6569,2,"Lastly, in all sentiment analyses, the sentiment polarities regarding political topics were always the lowest among the five topics of concern across all population groups."
6570,3,"Through large-scale Twitter data mining, this study revealed that meaningful differences regarding concerns and sentiments about COVID-19-related topics existed among population groups during the study period. "
6571,3,"Therefore, specialized and varied attention and support are needed for different population groups. "
6572,3,"In addition, the efficient analysis method implemented by our publicly released code can be utilized to dynamically track the evolution of each population group during the pandemic or any other major event for better informed public health research and interventions."
6573,4,Adaptation of Extended Reality Smart Glasses for Core Nursing Skill Training Among Undergraduate Nursing Students: Usability and Feasibility Study
6574,0,Skill training in nursing education has been highly dependent on self-training because of Korea's high student-faculty ratio. 
6575,0,"Students tend to have a passive attitude in self-practice, and it is hard to expect effective learning outcomes with traditional checklist-dependent self-practice. "
6576,0,"Smart glasses have a high potential to assist nursing students with timely information, and a hands-free device does not interrupt performance."
6577,1,"We conducted a usability and feasibility study with 30 undergraduate nursing students during a 2-hour open lab for self-practice of core nursing skills, wearing smart glasses for visualized guidance. "
6578,1,The usability test was conducted using a 16-item self-reporting questionnaire and 7 open-ended questions. 
6579,1,Learning satisfaction was assessed using a 7-item questionnaire. 
6580,1,"The number of practice sessions was recorded, and perceived competency in core nursing skills was measured before and after the intervention. "
6581,1,"At the final evaluation, performance accuracy and time consumed for completion were recorded."
6582,2,"Smart glass-assisted self-practice of nursing skills was perceived as helpful, convenient, and interesting. "
6583,2,"Participants reported improved recollection of sequences of skills, and perceived competency was significantly improved. "
6584,2,"Several issues were raised by participants regarding smart glasses, including small screen size, touch sensors, fogged lenses with masks, heaviness, and heat after a period of time."
6585,3,"Smart glasses have the potential to assist self-practice, providing timely information at students' own paces. "
6586,3,"Having both hands free from holding a device, participants reported the convenience of learning as they could practice and view the information simultaneously. "
6587,3,Further revision correcting reported issues would improve the applicability of smart glasses in other areas of nursing education.
6588,4,Using Automated Machine Learning to Predict the Mortality of Patients With COVID-19: Prediction Model Development Study
6589,0,"During a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. "
6590,0,Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. 
6591,0,Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. 
6592,0,"To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model."
6593,1,"Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. "
6594,1,"We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). "
6595,1,Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. 
6596,1,Patients' data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. 
6597,1,The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). 
6598,1,"Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. "
6599,1,"Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. "
6600,1,"AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables."
6601,2,Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. 
6602,2,The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). 
6603,2,"The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. "
6604,2,The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. 
6605,2,"The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. "
6606,2,"After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791)."
6607,3,We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. 
6608,3,"In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. "
6609,3,"This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning-based clinical decision support tools."
6610,4,Differences in the Gut Microbiome of Women With and Without Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder: Case Control Study
6611,0,The gut microbiome is receiving considerable attention as a potentially modifiable risk factor and therapeutic target for numerous mental and neurological diseases.
6612,1,"We employed an online recruitment method to enroll ""hard-to-reach"" HSDD populations. "
6613,1,"After a stringent diagnostic and exclusion process based on DSM-IV criteria, fecal samples collected from 24 women with HSDD and 22 age-matched, healthy controls underwent microbiome analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and metabolome analysis using untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry."
6614,2,We found a decreased abundance of Ruminococcaceae and increased abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus among women with HSDD. 
6615,2,Fecal samples from women with HSDD showed significantly altered metabolic signatures compared with healthy controls. 
6616,2,"The abundance of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and several fecal metabolites correlated negatively with the sexual desire score, while the number of Ruminococcaceae correlated positively with the sexual desire score in all subjects."
6617,3,Our analysis of fecal samples from women with HSDD and healthy controls identified significantly different gut microbes and metabolic signatures. 
6618,3,These preliminary findings could be useful for developing strategies to adjust the level of human sexual desire by modifying gut microbiota.
6619,4,Learning From Past Respiratory Infections to Predict COVID-19 Outcomes: Retrospective Study
6620,0,"For the clinical care of patients with well-established diseases, randomized trials, literature, and research are supplemented with clinical judgment to understand disease prognosis and inform treatment choices. "
6621,0,"In the void created by a lack of clinical experience with COVID-19, artificial intelligence (AI) may be an important tool to bolster clinical judgment and decision making However, a lack of clinical data restricts the design and development of such AI tools, particularly in preparation for an impending crisis or pandemic."
6622,1,Our framework used COVID-19-like cohorts to design and train AI models that were then validated on the COVID-19 population. 
6623,1,"The COVID-19-like cohorts included patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, unspecified pneumonia, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at an academic medical center from 2008 to 2019. "
6624,1,"In total, 15 training cohorts were created using different combinations of the COVID-19-like cohorts with the ARDS cohort for exploratory purposes. "
6625,1,"In this study, two machine learning models were developed: one to predict invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 hours for each hospitalized day, and one to predict all-cause mortality at the time of admission. "
6626,1,"Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. "
6627,1,We established model interpretability by calculating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scores to identify important features.
6628,2,"Compared to the COVID-19-like cohorts (n=16,509), the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n=159) were significantly younger, with a higher proportion of patients of Hispanic ethnicity, a lower proportion of patients with smoking history, and fewer patients with comorbidities (P<.001). "
6629,2,"Patients with COVID-19 had a lower IMV rate (15.1 versus 23.2, P=.02) and shorter time to IMV (2.9 versus 4.1 days, P<.001) compared to the COVID-19-like patients. "
6630,2,"In the COVID-19-like training data, the top models achieved excellent performance (AUROC>0.90). "
6631,2,"Validating in the COVID-19 cohort, the top-performing model for predicting IMV was the XGBoost model (AUROC=0.826) trained on the viral pneumonia cohort. "
6632,2,"Similarly, the XGBoost model trained on all 4 COVID-19-like cohorts without ARDS achieved the best performance (AUROC=0.928) in predicting mortality. "
6633,2,"Important predictors included demographic information (age), vital signs (oxygen saturation), and laboratory values (white blood cell count, cardiac troponin, albumin, etc). "
6634,2,"Our models had class imbalance, which resulted in high negative predictive values and low positive predictive values."
6635,3,"We provided a feasible framework for modeling patient deterioration using existing data and AI technology to address data limitations during the onset of a novel, rapidly changing pandemic."
6636,4,Using Tweets to Understand How COVID-19-Related Health Beliefs Are Affected in the Age of Social Media: Twitter Data Analysis Study
6637,0,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (ie, COVID-19) has given rise to a global pandemic affecting 215 countries and over 40 million people as of October 2020. "
6638,0,"Meanwhile, we are also experiencing an infodemic induced by the overabundance of information, some accurate and some inaccurate, spreading rapidly across social media platforms. "
6639,0,Social media has arguably shifted the information acquisition and dissemination of a considerably large population of internet users toward higher interactivities.
6640,1,We used COVID-19-related posts from the mainstream social media platform Twitter to monitor health beliefs. 
6641,1,"A total of 92,687,660 tweets corresponding to 8,967,986 unique users from January 6 to June 21, 2020, were retrieved. "
6642,1,"To quantify health beliefs, we employed the health belief model (HBM) with four core constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. "
6643,1,We utilized natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate the process of judging the conformity of each tweet with each of the four HBM constructs. 
6644,1,A total of 5000 tweets were manually annotated for training the machine learning architectures.
6645,2,The machine learning classifiers yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves over 0.86 for the classification of all four HBM constructs. 
6646,2,Our analyses revealed a basic reproduction number R(0 )of 7.62 for trends in the number of Twitter users posting health belief-related content over the study period. 
6647,2,"The fluctuations in the number of health belief-related tweets could reflect dynamics in case and death statistics, systematic interventions, and public events. "
6648,2,"Specifically, we observed that scientific events, such as scientific publications, and nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, were comparable in their ability to influence health belief trends on social media through a Kruskal-Wallis test (P=.78 and P=.92 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers, respectively)."
6649,3,"As an analogy of the classic epidemiology model where an infection is considered to be spreading in a population with an R-0 greater than 1, we found that the number of users tweeting about COVID-19 health beliefs was amplifying in an epidemic manner and could partially intensify the infodemic. "
6650,3,"It is ""unhealthy"" that both scientific and nonscientific events constitute no disparity in impacting the health belief trends on Twitter, since nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, might not be endorsed by substantial evidence and could sometimes be misleading."
6651,4,Telemedicine Use and Health-Related Concerns of Patients With Chronic Conditions During COVID-19: Survey of Members of Online Health Communities
6652,0,It has been widely communicated that individuals with underlying health conditions are at higher risk of severe disease due to COVID-19 than healthy peers. 
6653,0,"As social distancing measures continue during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts encourage individuals with underlying conditions to engage in telehealth appointments to maintain continuity of care while minimizing risk exposure. "
6654,0,"To date, however, little information has been provided regarding telehealth uptake among this high-risk population."
6655,1,"Data for this study were collected through an electronic survey distributed between May 12-14, 2020, to members of 26 online health communities for individuals with chronic disease. "
6656,1,"Descriptive statistics were run to explore telehealth use, support needs, and information sources, and z tests were run to assess differences in sociodemographic factors and information and support needs among those who did and did not use telehealth services."
6657,2,"Among the 2210 respondents, 1073 (49%) reported engaging in telehealth in the past 4 months. "
6658,2,"Higher proportions of women engaged in telehealth than men (890/1781, 50% vs 181/424, 43%; P=.007), and a higher proportion of those earning household incomes of more than US $100,000 engaged in telehealth than those earning less than US $30,000 (195/370, 53% vs 241/530 45%; P=.003). "
6659,2,"Although 59% (133/244) of those younger than 40 years and 54% (263/486) of those aged 40-55 years used telehealth, aging populations were less likely to do so, with only 45% (677/1500) of individuals 56 years or older reporting telehealth use (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively). "
6660,2,"Patients with cystic fibrosis, lupus, and ankylosing spondylitis recorded the highest proportions of individuals using telehealth when compared to those with other diagnoses. "
6661,2,"Of the 2210 participants, 1333 (60%) participants either looked up information about the virus online or planned to in the future, and when asked what information or support would be most helpful right now, over half (1151/2210, 52%) responded ""understanding how COVID-19 affects people with my health condition."""
6662,3,Nearly half of the study sample reported participating in telehealth in the past 4 months. 
6663,3,"Future efforts to engage individuals with underlying medical conditions in telehealth should focus on outreach to men, members of lower-income households, and aging populations. "
6664,3,These results may help inform and refine future health communications to further engage this at-risk population in telehealth as the pandemic continues.
6665,4,Efficiency and Quality of Data Collection Among Public Mental Health Surveys Conducted During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review
6666,0,The World Health Organization has recognized the importance of assessing population-level mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
6667,0,"During a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a timely surveillance method is urgently needed to track the impact on public mental health."
6668,1,We searched the PubMed database using the following search strings: ((COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2)) AND ((Mental health) OR (psychological) OR (psychiatry)). 
6669,1,"We screened the titles, abstracts, and texts of the published papers to exclude irrelevant studies. "
6670,1,We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of each research paper.
6671,2,"Our search yielded 37 relevant mental health surveys of the general public that were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, as of July 10, 2020. "
6672,2,"All these public mental health surveys were cross-sectional in design, and the journals efficiently made these articles available online in an average of 18.7 (range 1-64) days from the date they were received. "
6673,2,"The average duration of recruitment periods was 9.2 (range 2-35) days, and the average sample size was 5137 (range 100-56,679). "
6674,2,"However, 73% (27/37) of the selected studies had Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scores of <3 points, which suggests that these studies are of very low quality for inclusion in a meta-analysis."
6675,3,"The studies examined in this systematic review used an efficient data collection method, but there was a high risk of bias, in general, among the existing public mental health surveys. "
6676,3,"Therefore, following recommendations to avoid selection bias, or employing novel methodologies considering both a longitudinal design and high temporal resolution, would help provide a strong basis for the formation of national mental health policies."
6677,4,The Promise and Peril of Mobile Phones for Youth in Rural Uganda: Multimethod Study of Implications for Health and HIV
6678,0,"In East Africa, where landlines are used by 1% of the population and access to the internet is limited, owning a cell phone is rapidly becoming essential for acquiring information and resources. "
6679,0,Our analysis illuminates the perils and potential promise of mobile phones with implications for future interventions to promote the health of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) and to prevent HIV infection.
6680,1,"We identified 2 trading centers that were representative of southern Uganda in terms of key demographics, proportion of cell phone ownership, and community HIV prevalence. "
6681,1,"We stratified the sample of potential informants by age group (15-19 years and 20-24 years), gender, and phone ownership and randomly sampled 31 key informant interview participants within these categories. "
6682,1,"In addition, we conducted 24 ethnographic participant observations among AYAs in the communities of study."
6683,2,"AYA frequently reported barriers to using their phones, such as difficulty accessing electricity. "
6684,2,Nearly all AYAs used mobile phones to participate in the local economy and communicate with sexual partners. 
6685,2,"Phone use was frequently a point of contention between sexual partners, with many AYAs reporting that their sexual partners associated phone use with infidelity. "
6686,2,"Few AYAs reported using their phones for health-related purposes, with most getting health information in person from health workers. "
6687,2,"However, most AYAs reported an instance when they used their phone in an emergency, with childbirth-related emergencies being the most common. "
6688,2,"Finally, most AYAs reported that they would like to use their phones for health purposes and specifically stated that they would like to use their mobile phones to access current HIV prevention information."
6689,3,This study demonstrates how mobile phones are related to income-generating practices in the region and communication with sexual partners but not access to health and HIV information. 
6690,3,"Our analysis offers some explanation for our previous study, which suggested an association between mobile phone ownership, having multiple sexual partners, and HIV risk. "
6691,3,Mobile phones have untapped potential to serve as tools for health promotion and HIV prevention.
6692,4,Expanding Telemonitoring in a Virtual World: A Case Study of the Expansion of a Heart Failure Telemonitoring Program During the COVID-19 Pandemic
6693,0,"To minimize the spread and risk of a COVID-19 outbreak, societal norms have been challenged with respect to how essential services are delivered. "
6694,0,"With pressures to reduce the number of in-person ambulatory visits, innovative models of telemonitoring have been used during the pandemic as a necessary alternative to support access to care for patients with chronic conditions. "
6695,0,"The pandemic has led health care organizations to consider the adoption of telemonitoring interventions for the first time, while others have seen existing programs rapidly expand."
6696,1,A single-case qualitative study was conducted with 3 embedded units of analysis. 
6697,1,"Semistructured interviews probed the experiences of patients, clinicians, and program staff from the Medly telemonitoring program at a heart function clinic in Toronto, Canada. "
6698,1,Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis as well as Eakin and Gladstone's value-adding approach to enhance the analytic interpretation of the study findings.
6699,2,"A total of 29 participants were interviewed, including patients (n=16), clinicians (n=9), and operational staff (n=4). "
6700,2,Four themes were identified: (1) providing care continuity through telemonitoring; (2) adapting telemonitoring operations for a more virtual health care system; (3) confronting virtual workflow challenges; and (4) fostering a meaningful patient-provider relationship. 
6701,2,"Beyond supporting virtual visits, the program's ability to provide a more comprehensive picture of the patient's health was valued. "
6702,2,"However, issues relating to the lack of system integration and alert-driven interactions jeopardized the perceived sustainability of the program."
6703,3,"With the reduction of in-person visits during the pandemic, virtual services such as telemonitoring have demonstrated significant value. "
6704,3,"Based on our study findings, we offer recommendations to proactively adapt and scale telemonitoring programs under the changing conditions of an increasingly virtual health care system. "
6705,3,"These include revisiting the scope and expectations of telemedicine interventions, streamlining virtual patient onboarding processes, and personalizing the collection of patient information to build a stronger virtual relationship and a more holistic assessment of patient well-being."
6706,4,Gaining Insights Into the Estimation of the Circadian Rhythms of Social Activity in Older Adults From Their Telephone Call Activity With Statistical Learning: Observational Study
6707,0,Understanding the social mechanisms of the circadian rhythms of activity represents a major issue in better managing the mechanisms of age-related diseases occurring over time in the elderly population. 
6708,0,The automated analysis of call detail records (CDRs) provided by modern phone technologies can help meet such an objective. 
6709,0,"At this stage, however, whether and how the circadian rhythms of telephone call activity can be automatically and properly modeled in the elderly population remains to be established."
6710,1,We analyzed a 12-month data set of outgoing telephone CDRs of 26 adults older than 65 years of age. 
6711,1,We designed a statistical learning modeling approach adapted for exploratory analysis. 
6712,1,"First, Gaussian mixture models (GM Ms) were calculated to automatically model each participant's circadian rhythm of telephone call activity. "
6713,1,"Second, k-means clustering was used for grouping participants into distinct groups depending on the characteristics of their personal GMMs."
6714,2,The results showed the existence of specific structures of telephone call activity in the daily social activity of older adults. 
6715,2,"At the individual level, GM:Ms allowed the identification of personal habits, such as morningness-eveningness for making calls. "
6716,2,"At the population level, k-means clustering allowed the structuring of these individual habits into specific morningness or eveningness clusters."
6717,3,These findings support the potential of phone technologies and statistical learning approaches to automatically provide personalized and precise information on the social rhythms of telephone call activity of older individuals. 
6718,3,Futures studies could integrate such digital insights with other sources of data to complete assessments of the circadian rhythms of activity in elderly populations.
6719,4,Utilization of Self-Diagnosis Health Chatbots in Real-World Settings: Case Study
6720,0,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chatbots are increasingly being used in health care, but most chatbots are designed for a specific population and evaluated in controlled settings. "
6721,0,"There is little research documenting how health consumers (eg, patients and caregivers) use chatbots for self-diagnosis purposes in real-world scenarios."
6722,1,We employed a data-driven approach to analyze the system log of a widely deployed self-diagnosis chatbot in China. 
6723,1,"Our data set consisted of 47,684 consultation sessions initiated by 16,519 users over 6 months. "
6724,1,"The log data included a variety of information, including users' nonidentifiable demographic information, consultation details, diagnostic reports, and user feedback. "
6725,1,We conducted both statistical analysis and content analysis on this heterogeneous data set.
6726,2,"The chatbot users spanned all age groups, including middle-aged and older adults. "
6727,2,"Users consulted the chatbot on a wide range of medical conditions, including those that often entail considerable privacy and social stigma issues. "
6728,2,"Furthermore, we distilled 2 prominent issues in the use of the chatbot: (1) a considerable number of users dropped out in the middle of their consultation sessions, and (2) some users pretended to have health concerns and used the chatbot for nontherapeutic purposes. "
6729,2,"Finally, we identified a set of user concerns regarding the use of the chatbot, including insufficient actionable information and perceived inaccurate diagnostic suggestions."
6730,3,"Although health chatbots are considered to be convenient tools for enhancing patient-centered care, there are issues and barriers impeding the optimal use of this novel technology. "
6731,3,Designers and developers should employ user-centered approaches to address the issues and user concerns to achieve the best uptake and utilization. 
6732,3,"We conclude the paper by discussing several design implications, including making the chatbots more informative, easy-to-use, and trustworthy, as well as improving the onboarding experience to enhance user engagement."
6733,4,Internet-Based Support and Coaching With Complementary Clinic Visits for Young People With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism: Controlled Feasibility Study
6734,0,Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can experience obstacles in traditional health care situations due to difficulties associated with their impairment.
6735,1,"Individuals with ADHD and/or ASD aged 15-32 years were recruited in 2 clinical settings, where they received either IBSC (n=24) or treatment as usual (TAU; n=20). "
6736,1,"Outcome measures included self-report questionnaires assessing quality of life (Manchester Short Assessment for Quality of Life), sense of coherence (Sense Of Coherence 29), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale-Self-reported, respectively)."
6737,2,Significant between-group effects were observed in measures of anxiety (HADS) at postintervention (P=.02) as well as at the 6-month follow-up (P=.004). 
6738,2,Significant between-group effects were also noted for depressive symptoms (HADS) postintervention (P=.04). 
6739,2,The between-group effects were partially explained by a deterioration in the TAU group. 
6740,2,A significant increase in self-esteem (P=.04) as well as a decrease in anxiety (P=.003) at the 6-month follow-up was observed in the intervention group following IBSC. 
6741,2,Findings from a qualitative study of the intervention are consistent with the results.
6742,3,The findings from this study suggest that IBSC holds promise as a feasible complement or alternative to traditional face-to-face health care meetings.
6743,4,COVID-19 Symptom-Related Google Searches and Local COVID-19 Incidence in Spain: Correlational Study
6744,0,"COVID-19 is one of the biggest pandemics in human history, along with other disease pandemics, such as the H1N1 influenza A, bubonic plague, and smallpox pandemics. "
6745,0,This study is a small contribution that tries to find contrasted formulas to alleviate global suffering and guarantee a more manageable future.
6746,1,We assessed the linear correlation between Google Trends search data and the data provided by the National Center of Epidemiology in Spain-which is dependent on the Instituto de Salud Carlos III-regarding the number of COVID-19 cases reported with a certain time lag. 
6747,1,These data enabled the identification of anticipatory patterns.
6748,2,"In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrate that by using our correlation test, the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic can be predicted in Spain up to 11 days in advance."
6749,3,"During the epidemic, Google Trends offers the possibility to preempt health care decisions in real time by tracking people's concerns through their search patterns. "
6750,3,"This can be of great help given the critical, if not dramatic need for complementary monitoring approaches that work on a population level and inform public health decisions in real time. "
6751,3,"This study of Google search patterns, which was motivated by the fears of individuals in the face of a pandemic, can be useful in anticipating the development of the pandemic."
6752,4,Considerations for Community-Based mHealth Initiatives: Insights From Three Beacon Communities
6753,0,Emerging evidence suggests that people with arthritis are reporting increased physical pain and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
6754,0,"At the same time, Twitter's daily usage has surged by 23% throughout the pandemic period, presenting a unique opportunity to assess the content and sentiment of tweets. "
6755,0,"Individuals with arthritis use Twitter to communicate with peers, and to receive up-to-date information from health professionals and services about novel therapies and management techniques."
6756,1,"From March 20 to April 20, 2020, publicly available tweets posted in English and with hashtag combinations related to arthritis and COVID-19 were extracted retrospectively from Twitter. "
6757,1,"Content analysis was used to identify common themes within tweets, and sentiment analysis was used to examine positive and negative emotions in themes to understand the COVID-19 experiences of people with arthritis."
6758,2,"In total, 149 tweets were analyzed. "
6759,2,The majority of tweeters were female and were from the United States. 
6760,2,"Tweeters reported a range of arthritis conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and psoriatic arthritis. "
6761,2,"Seven themes were identified: health care experiences, personal stories, links to relevant blogs, discussion of arthritis-related symptoms, advice sharing, messages of positivity, and stay-at-home messaging. "
6762,2,"Sentiment analysis demonstrated marked anxiety around medication shortages, increased physical symptom burden, and strong desire for trustworthy information and emotional connection."
6763,3,Tweets by people with arthritis highlight the multitude of concurrent concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
6764,3,"Understanding these concerns, which include heightened physical and psychological symptoms in the context of treatment misinformation, may assist clinicians to provide person-centered care during this time of great health uncertainty."
6765,4,Dimensions of Misinformation About the HPV Vaccine on Instagram: Content and Network Analysis of Social Media Characteristics
6766,0,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is a major advancement in cancer prevention and this primary prevention tool has the potential to reduce and eliminate HPV-associated cancers; however, the safety and efficacy of vaccines in general and the HPV vaccine specifically have come under attack, particularly through the spread of misinformation on social media. "
6767,0,The popular social media platform Instagram represents a significant source of exposure to health (mis)information; 1 in 3 US adults use Instagram.
6768,1,"From April 2018 to December 2018, we collected publicly available English-language Instagram posts containing hashtags #HPV, #HPVVaccine, or #Gardasil using Netlytic software (n=16,607). "
6769,1,"We randomly selected 10% of the sample and content analyzed relevant posts (n=580) for text, image, and social media features as well as holistic attributes (eg, sentiments, personal stories). "
6770,1,"Among antivaccine posts, we organized elements of misinformation within four broad dimensions: 1) misinformation theoretical domains, 2) vaccine debate topics, 3) evidence base, and 4) health beliefs. "
6771,1,"We conducted univariate, bivariate, and network analyses on the subsample of posts to quantify the role and position of individual posts in the network."
6772,2,"Compared to provaccine posts (324/580, 55.9%), antivaccine posts (256/580, 44.1%) were more likely to originate from individuals (64.1% antivaccine vs 25.0% provaccine; P<.001) and include personal narratives (37.1% vs 25.6%; P=.003). "
6773,2,"In the antivaccine network, core misinformation characteristics included mentioning #Gardasil, purporting to reveal a lie (ie, concealment), conspiracy theories, unsubstantiated claims, and risk of vaccine injury. "
6774,2,"Information/resource posts clustered around misinformation domains including falsification, nanopublications, and vaccine-preventable disease, whereas personal narrative posts clustered around different domains of misinformation, including concealment, injury, and conspiracy theories. "
6775,2,"The most liked post (6634 likes) in our full subsample was a positive personal narrative post, created by a non-health individual; the most liked post (5604 likes) in our antivaccine subsample was an informational post created by a health individual."
6776,3,"Identifying characteristics of misinformation related to HPV vaccine on social media will inform targeted interventions (eg, network opinion leaders) and help sow corrective information and stories tailored to different falsehoods."
6777,4,"Mobile Apps to Reduce Tobacco, Alcohol, and Illicit Drug Use: Systematic Review of the First Decade"
6778,0,Mobile apps for problematic substance use have the potential to bypass common barriers to treatment seeking. 
6779,0,"Ten years following the release of the first app targeting problematic tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use, their effectiveness, use, and acceptability remains unclear."
6780,1,The review was conducted according to recommended guidelines. 
6781,1,"Relevant databases were searched, and articles were included if the mobile app study was a controlled intervention trial and reported alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug consumption as outcomes."
6782,2,"A total of 20 studies met eligibility criteria across a range of substances: alcohol (n=11), tobacco (n=6), alcohol and tobacco (n=1), illicit drugs (n=1), and illicit drugs and alcohol (n=1). "
6783,2,"Samples included the general community, university students, and clinical patients. "
6784,2,"The analyzed intervention sample sizes ranged from 22 to 14,228, and content was considerably diverse, from simple stand-alone apps delivering self-monitoring or psychoeducation to multicomponent apps with interactive features and audio content, or used as adjuncts alongside face-to-face treatment. "
6785,2,"Intervention duration ranged from 1 to 35 weeks, with notifications ranging from none to multiple times per day. "
6786,2,"A total of 6 of the 20 app interventions reported significant reductions in substance use at post or follow-up compared with a comparison condition, with small to moderate effect sizes. "
6787,2,"Furthermore, two other app interventions reported significant reductions during the intervention but not at post treatment, and a third reported a significant interaction of two app intervention components."
6788,3,"Although most app interventions were associated with reductions in problematic substance use, less than one-third were significantly better than the comparison conditions at post treatment. "
6789,3,"A total of 5 out of the 6 apps that reported intervention effects targeted alcohol (of those, one targeted alcohol and illicit drugs and another alcohol and tobacco) and 1 targeted tobacco. "
6790,3,"Moreover, 3 out of 6 apps included feedback (eg, personalized) and 2 had high risk of bias, 1 some risk, and 3 low risk. "
6791,3,All 6 apps included interventions of 6 weeks or longer. 
6792,3,"Common study limitations were small sample sizes; risk of bias; lack of relevant details; and, in some cases, poorly balanced comparison conditions. "
6793,3,"Appropriately powered trials are required to understand which app interventions are most effective, length of engagement required, and subgroups most likely to benefit. "
6794,3,"In sum, evidence to date for the effectiveness of apps targeting problematic substance use is not compelling, although the heterogeneous comparison conditions and trial designs across studies limit the ability to compare efficacy between apps. "
6795,3,We discuss potential approaches that can help ascertain whether the promise of mobile app interventions for problematic substance use can be fulfilled.
6796,4,Quantitative Methods for Analyzing Intimate Partner Violence in Microblogs: Observational Study
6797,0,"Social media is a rich, virtually untapped source of data on the dynamics of intimate partner violence, one that is both global in scale and intimate in detail."
6798,1,"Human annotation, part-of-speech tagging, and machine learning predictive models, including support vector machines, were used on a Twitter data set of 8767 #WhylStayed and #WhylLeft tweets each."
6799,2,"Our methods explored whether we can analyze micronarratives that include details about victims, abusers, and other stakeholders, the actions that constitute abuse, and how the stakeholders respond."
6800,3,"Our findings are consistent across various machine learning methods, which correspond to observations in the clinical literature, and affirm the relevance of natural language processing and machine learning for exploring issues of societal importance in social media."
6801,4,Acceptability of Using a Robotic Nursing Assistant in Health Care Environments: Experimental Pilot Study
6802,0,"According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, nurses will be the largest labor pool in the United States by 2022, and more than 1.1 million nursing positions have to be filled by then in order to avoid a nursing shortage. "
6803,0,"In addition, the incidence rate of musculoskeletal disorders in nurses is above average in comparison with other occupations. "
6804,0,Robot-assisted health care has the potential to alleviate the nursing shortage by automating mundane and routine nursing tasks. 
6805,0,"Furthermore, robots in health care environments may assist with safe patient mobility and handling and may thereby reduce the likelihood of musculoskeletal disorders."
6806,1,We conducted a trial with 24 participants to collect data and address the following research question: Is the use of ARNA as an ambulatory assistive device for patients acceptable to nurses? 
6807,1,The experiments were conducted in a simulated hospital environment. 
6808,1,"Nursing students (as proxies for nursing staff) were grouped in dyads, with one participant serving as a nurse and the other acting as a patient. "
6809,1,Two questionnaires were developed and administrated to the participants based on the Technology Acceptance Model with respect to the two subscales of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use metrics. 
6810,1,"In order to evaluate the internal consistency/reliability of the questionnaires, we calculated Cronbach alpha coefficients. "
6811,1,"Furthermore, statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the relation of each variable in the questionnaires with the overall perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use metrics."
6812,2,"Both Cronbach alpha values were acceptably high (.93 and .82 for perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use questionnaires, respectively), indicating high internal consistency of the questionnaires. "
6813,2,The correlation between the variables and the overall perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use metrics was moderate. 
6814,2,"The average perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use metrics among the participants were 4.13 and 5.42, respectively, out of possible score of 7, indicating a higher-than-average acceptability of this service robot."
6815,3,"The results served to identify factors that could affect nurses' acceptance of ARNA and aspects needing improvement (eg, flexibility, ease of operation, and autonomy level)."
6816,4,Machine Learning to Predict Mortality and Critical Events in a Cohort of Patients With COVID-19 in New York City: Model Development and Validation
6817,0,COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide and is responsible for several hundred thousand fatalities. 
6818,0,The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. 
6819,0,"However, effective methods to meet these needs are lacking."
6820,1,"We used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and baseline comparator models to predict in-hospital mortality and critical events at time windows of 3, 5, 7, and 10 days from admission. "
6821,1,"Our study population included harmonized EHR data from five hospitals in New York City for 4098 COVID-19-positive patients admitted from March 15 to May 22, 2020. "
6822,1,"The models were first trained on patients from a single hospital (n=1514) before or on May 1, externally validated on patients from four other hospitals (n=2201) before or on May 1, and prospectively validated on all patients after May 1 (n=383). "
6823,1,"Finally, we established model interpretability to identify and rank variables that drive model predictions."
6824,2,"Upon cross-validation, the XGBoost classifier outperformed baseline models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for mortality of 0.89 at 3 days, 0.85 at 5 and 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days. "
6825,2,"XGBoost also performed well for critical event prediction, with an AUC-ROC of 0.80 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days. "
6826,2,"In external validation, XGBoost achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.88 at 3 days, 0.86 at 5 days, 0.86 at 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days for mortality prediction. "
6827,2,"Similarly, the unimputed XGBoost model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.78 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days. "
6828,2,Trends in performance on prospective validation sets were similar. 
6829,2,"At 7 days, acute kidney injury on admission, elevated LDH, tachypnea, and hyperglycemia were the strongest drivers of critical event prediction, while higher age, anion gap, and C-reactive protein were the strongest drivers of mortality prediction."
6830,3,We externally and prospectively trained and validated machine learning models for mortality and critical events for patients with COVID-19 at different time horizons. 
6831,3,These models identified at-risk patients and uncovered underlying relationships that predicted outcomes.
6832,4,Understanding the Steps Toward Mobile Early Intervention for Mothers and Their Infants Exiting the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Descriptive Examination
6833,0,"Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) history, combined with systemic inequities for mothers of nondominant cultures and mothers who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, places infants at an extraordinary risk for poor developmental outcomes throughout life. "
6834,0,"Although receipt of early intervention (El) is the best single predictor of developmental outcomes among children with and at risk for early developmental delays, mothers and infants with the greatest needs are least likely to receive EI. "
6835,0,Mobile internet-based interventions afford substantial advantages for overcoming logistical challenges that often prevent mothers who are economically disadvantaged from accessing EI. 
6836,0,"However, the bridge from the NICU to a mobile internet intervention has been virtually unexplored."
6837,1,Three NICUs serving the urban poor in a Midwestern city were provided support in establishing an electronic NICU exit referral mechanism into a randomized controlled trial of a mobile internet intervention for mothers and their infants. 
6838,1,"Measurement domains to reflect the bridge to service included each crucial gateway required for navigating the path into Part C EI, including referral, screening, assessment, and intervention access. "
6839,1,An iterative process was used and documented to facilitate each NICU in establishing an individualized accountability plan for sharing referral materials with mothers before their NICU exit. 
6840,1,"Subsequent to the referral, progression flow was documented on the basis of a real-time electronic recording of service receipt and contact records. "
6841,1,Mother and infant risk characteristics were also assessed. 
6842,1,Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarize and characterize each measurement domain.
6843,2,NICU referral rates for EI were 3 to 4 times higher for open-shared versus closed-single gatekeeper referral processes. 
6844,2,"Of 86 referred dyads, 67 (78%) were screened, and of those screened, 51 (76%) were eligible for assessment. "
6845,2,"Of the 51 assessment-eligible mothers and infants, 35 dyads (69%) completed the assessment and 31 (89%) went on to complete at least one remote coaching intervention session. "
6846,2,The dyads who accessed and engaged in intervention were racially and ethnically diverse and experiencing substantial adversity.
6847,3,The transition from the NICU to home was fraught with missed opportunities for an EI referral. 
6848,3,"Beyond the referral, the most prominent reason for not participating in screening was that mothers could not be located after exiting the NICU. "
6849,3,Stronger NICU referral mechanisms for EI are needed. 
6850,3,It may be essential to initiate mobile interventions before exiting the NICU for maintaining post-NICU contact with some mothers. 
6851,3,"In contrast to a closed, single point of referral gatekeeper systems in NICUs, open, shared referral gating systems may be less stymied by individual service provider biases and disruptions."
6852,4,Quality of Care Perceived by Older Patients and Caregivers in Integrated Care Pathways With Interviewing Assistance From a Social Robot: Noninferiority Randomized Controlled Trial
6853,0,"Society is facing a global shortage of 17 million health care workers, along with increasing health care demands from a growing number of older adults. "
6854,0,Social robots are being considered as solutions to part of this problem.
6855,1,"A multicenter, two-parallel-group, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial was used to test for noninferiority of the quality of care delivered through robot-assisted care. "
6856,1,The randomization was performed using a computer-generated table. 
6857,1,"The setting consisted of two outpatient clinics, and the study took place from July to December 2019. "
6858,1,"Of 419 patients who visited the participating outpatient clinics, 110 older patients met the criteria for recruitment. "
6859,1,Inclusion criteria were the ability to speak and read Dutch and being assisted by a participating health care professional. 
6860,1,"Exclusion criteria were serious hearing or vision problems, serious cognitive problems, and paranoia or similar psychiatric problems. "
6861,1,The intervention consisted of a social robot conducting a 36-item PROM. 
6862,1,"As the main outcome measure, the customized Consumer Quality Index (CQI) was used, as reported by patients and caregivers for the outpatient pathway of care."
6863,2,"In total, 75 intermediately frail older patients were included in the study, randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups, and processed: 36 female (48%) and 39 male (52%); mean age 77.4 years (SD 7.3), range 60-91 years. "
6864,2,"There was no significant difference in the total patient CQI scores between the patients included in the robot-assisted care pathway (mean 9.27, SD 0.65, n=37) and those in the control group (mean 9.00, SD 0.70, n=38): P=.08, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.58. "
6865,2,"There was no significant difference in the total CQI scores between caregivers in the intervention group (mean 9.21, SD 0.76, n=30) and those in the control group (mean 9.09, SD 0.60, n=35): P=.47, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.46. "
6866,2,No harm or unintended effects occurred.
6867,3,Geriatric patients and their informal caregivers valued robot-assisted and nonrobot-assisted care pathways equally.
6868,4,Perinatal Distress During COVID-19: Thematic Analysis of an Online Parenting Forum
6869,0,"The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted the whole of society, requiring rapid implementation of individual-, population-, and system-level public health responses to contain and reduce the spread of infection. "
6870,0,"Women in the perinatal period (pregnant, birthing, and postpartum) have unique and timely needs for directives on health, safety, and risk aversion during periods of isolation and physical distancing for themselves, their child or children, and other family members. "
6871,0,"In addition, they are a vulnerable group at increased risk of psychological distress that may be exacerbated in the context of social support deprivation and a high-risk external environment."
6872,1,"A leading Australian online support forum for women pre- through to postbirth was used to interrogate all posts related to COVID-19 from January 27 to May 12, 2020, inclusive. "
6873,1,"Key search terms included ""COVID,"" ""corona,"" and ""pandemic."" A three-phase analysis was conducted, including thematic analysis, sentiment analysis, and word frequency calculations."
6874,2,"The search yielded 960 posts, of which 831 were included in our analysis. "
6875,2,"The qualitative thematic analysis demonstrated reasonable understanding, interpretation, and application of relevant restrictions in place, with five emerging themes identified. "
6876,2,"These were (1) heightened distress related to a high-risk external environment; (2) despair and anticipatory grief due to deprivation of social and family support, and bonding rituals; (3) altered family and support relationships; (4) guilt-tampered happiness; and (5) family future postponed. "
6877,2,Sentiment analysis revealed that the content was predominantly negative (very negative: n=537 and moderately negative: n=443 compared to very positive: n=236 and moderately positive: n=340). 
6878,2,"Negative words were frequently used in the 831 posts with associated derivatives including ""worried"" (n=165, 19.9%), ""risk"" (n=143, 17.2%), ""anxiety"" (n=98, 11.8%), ""concerns"" (n=74, 8.8%), and ""stress"" (n=69, 8.3%)."
6879,3,Women in the perinatal period are uniquely impacted by the current pandemic. 
6880,3,General information on COVID-19 safe behaviors did not meet the particular needs of this cohort. 
6881,3,"The lack of nuanced and timely information may exacerbate the risk of psychological and psychosocial distress in this vulnerable, high-risk group. "
6882,3,"State and federal public health departments need to provide a central repository of information that is targeted, consistent, accessible, timely, and reassuring. "
6883,3,"Compensatory social and emotional support should be considered, using alternative measures to mitigate the risk of mental health disorders in this cohort."
6884,4,Web-Based Interventions for Dietary Behavior in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
6885,0,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is among the most prevalent noncommunicable health conditions worldwide, affecting over 500 million people globally. "
6886,0,"Diet is a key aspect of T2DM management with dietary modification shown to elicit clinically meaningful outcomes such as improved glycemic control, and reductions in weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors. "
6887,0,"Web-based interventions provide a potentially convenient and accessible method for delivering dietary education, but its effects on dietary behavior in people with T2DM are unknown."
6888,1,"Per PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, systematic literature searches were performed using Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL to retrieve papers from January 2013 to May 2019. "
6889,1,Randomized controlled trials of web-based interventions in adults with T2DM with reported dietary assessment were included. 
6890,1,"Population and intervention characteristics, dietary guidelines and assessments, and significant clinical outcomes were extracted. "
6891,1,Differences between groups and within groups were assessed for dietary behavior and clinical outcomes.
6892,2,"There were 714 records screened, and five studies comprising 1056 adults were included. "
6893,2,"Studies measured dietary changes by assessing overall diet quality, changes in specific dietary components, or dietary knowledge scores. "
6894,2,"Significant improvements in dietary behavior were reported in four out of the five studies, representing healthier food choices, improvements in eating habits, reductions in carbohydrates, added sugar, sodium, saturated fat and overall fat intake, and/or increases in dietary knowledge. "
6895,2,"Three studies found significant mean reductions for hemoglobin A1c ranging from -0.3% to -0.8%, and/or weight ranging from -2.3 kg to -12.7 kg, fasting blood glucose (-1 mmol/L), waist circumference (-1 cm), and triglycerides (-60.1 mg/dL). "
6896,2,"These studies provided varied dietary recommendations from standard dietary guidelines, national health program guidelines, and a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet."
6897,3,"This review provided evidence that web-based interventions may be an effective way to support dietary behavior change in people with T2DM, potentially leading to changes in glycemic control and other clinical outcomes. "
6898,3,"However, the evidence should be viewed as preliminary as there were only five studies included with considerable heterogeneity in terms of the diets recommended, the dietary assessment measures used, the complexity of the interventions, and the modes and methods of delivery."
6899,4,Information and Communications Technology-Based Interventions Targeting Patient Empowerment: Framework Development
6900,0,"Empowerment of patients is often an explicit goal of various information and communications technology (ICT) (electronic, digital) interventions where the patients themselves use ICT tools via the internet. "
6901,0,"Although several models of empowerment exist, a comprehensive and pragmatic framework is lacking for the development of such interventions."
6902,1,This study is based on a literature review and iterated expert discussions including a focus group to formulate the proposed model. 
6903,1,Our model is based on a review of various models of empowerment and models of technology intervention.
6904,2,"Our framework includes the core characteristics of the empowerment concept (control, psychological coping, self-efficacy, understanding, legitimacy, and support) as well as a set of empowerment consequences: expressed patient perceptions, behavior, clinical outcomes, and health systems effects. "
6905,2,The framework for designing interventions includes strategies to achieve empowerment goals using different ICT services. 
6906,2,"Finally, the intervention model can be used to define project evaluations where the aim is to demonstrate empowerment. "
6907,2,The study also included example indicators and associated measurement instruments.
6908,3,"This framework, which includes definitions, can be useful for the design and evaluation of digital interventions targeting patient empowerment and assist in the development of methods to measure results in this dimension. "
6909,3,Further evaluation in the form of interventional studies will be needed to assess the generalizability of the model.
6910,4,Prognostic Modeling of COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence in the United Kingdom: Model Development and Validation
6911,0,The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a public health emergency and the case fatality rate in the United Kingdom is significant. 
6912,0,"Although there appear to be several early predictors of outcome, there are no currently validated prognostic models or scoring systems applicable specifically to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2."
6913,1,"We present an ANN that can provide a patient-specific, point-of-admission mortality risk prediction to inform clinical management decisions at the earliest opportunity. "
6914,1,"The ANN analyzes a set of patient features including demographics, commbidities, smoking history, and presenting symptoms and predicts patient-specific mortality risk during the current hospital admission. "
6915,1,The model was trained and validated on data extracted from 398 patients admitted to hospital with a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2.
6916,2,"Patient-specific mortality was predicted with 86.25% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 87.50% (95% CI 61.65%-98.45%) and specificity of 85.94% (95% CI 74.98%-93.36%). "
6917,2,"The positive predictive value was 60.87% (95% CI 45.23%-74.56%), and the negative predictive value was 96.49% (95% CI 88.23%-99.02%). "
6918,2,The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 90.12%.
6919,3,"This analysis demonstrates an adaptive ANN trained on data at a single site, which demonstrates the early utility of deep learning approaches in a rapidly evolving pandemic with no established or validated prognostic scoring systems."
6920,4,Features and Functionalities of Smartphone Apps Related to COVID-19: Systematic Search in App Stores and Content Analysis
6921,0,Knowledge of the quantity and quality of apps related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is lacking. 
6922,0,"In addition, no directory has been established listing all the apps developed to address the COVID-19 pandemic."
6923,1,"We performed an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study of all smartphone apps associated with COVID-19. "
6924,1,"Between April 27 and May 2, 2020, we searched the App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) for COVID-19 apps. "
6925,1,"The search terms used were coronavirus, COVID-19, and SARS-COV-2. "
6926,1,The apps were downloaded and evaluated. 
6927,1,"The variables analyzed were name, platform, country, language, category, cost, update date, size, version, number of downloads, developer, and purpose. "
6928,1,"Purpose was further classified into the following categories: news, general information, self-diagnosis, contact tracing, notices to contacts, notification of close cases, awareness, helplines, monitoring of clinical parameters, recording of symptoms and treatment, and messaging with health care professionals."
6929,2,We identified 114 apps on the investigated platforms. 
6930,2,"Of these, 62/114 (54.4%) were on Android and 52/114 (45.6%) were on iOS. "
6931,2,"Of the 114 apps, 37 (32.5%) were developed in Europe, 32 (28.1%) in Asia, and 30 (26.3%) in North America. "
6932,2,"The most frequent languages were English (65/114, 57.0%), Spanish (34/114, 29.8%), and Chinese (14/114, 12.3%). "
6933,2,"The most common categories were health and well-being/fitness apps (41/114, 41.2%) and medicine apps (43/114, 37.7%). "
6934,2,"Of the 114 apps, 113 (99.1%) were free. "
6935,2,The mean time between the date of the analysis and the date of the last update was 11.1 days (SD 11.0). 
6936,2,"Overall, 95 of the 114 apps (83.3%) were intended for the general population, 99 apps (7.9%) were intended for health professionals, and 3 apps (2.6%) were intended for both. "
6937,2,"Regarding the type of developer, 64/114 apps (56.1%) were developed by governments; 42/114 (64.1%) were developed by national governments, and 23/114 (35.9%) were developed by regional governments. "
6938,2,"The apps with the highest number of downloads (100,000+) were developed by governments (P=.13), except for the World Health Organization app (500,000+). "
6939,2,"The purposes of the apps available in Western languages (107/114, 93.9%) were determined; the most common purposes were general information about COVID-19 (66, 64.0%), COVID-19 news (53, 51.0%), recording of symptoms (53, 51.0%), and contact tracing (51, 47.7%). "
6940,2,More than one purpose was identified for 99/107 apps (92.5%).
6941,3,This paper offers a comprehensive and unique review of all available COVID -19 apps. 
6942,3,"Governments have adopted these tools during the pandemic, and more than half of the apps were developed by government agencies. "
6943,3,"The most common purposes of the apps are providing information on the numbers of infected, recovered, and deceased patients, recording of symptoms, and contact tracing."
6944,4,Evidence on Virtual Reality-Based Therapies for Psychiatric Disorders: Meta-Review of Meta-Analyses
6945,0,"Among all diseases globally, mental illnesses are one of the major causes of burden. "
6946,0,"As many people are resistant to conventional evidence-based treatments, there is an unmet need for the implementation of novel mental health treatments. "
6947,0,Efforts to increase the effectiveness and benefits of evidence-based psychotherapy in psychiatry have led to the emergence of virtual reality (VR)-based interventions. 
6948,0,These interventions have shown a wide range of advantages over conventional psychotherapies. 
6949,0,"Currently, VR-based interventions have been developed mainly for anxiety-related disorders; however, they are also used for developmental disorders, severe mental disorders, and neurocognitive disorders."
6950,1,"A systematic search was performed using the following electronic databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (any time until February 2020). "
6951,1,Meta-analyses were included as long as they quantitatively examined the efficacy of VR-based interventions for symptoms of a psychiatric disorder. 
6952,1,"To avoid overlap among meta-analyses, for each subanalysis included within this meta-review, only one analysis provided from one meta-analysis was selected based on the best quality of evidence."
6953,2,The search retrieved 11 eligible meta-analyses. 
6954,2,The quality of evidence varied from very low to moderate quality. 
6955,2,"Several reasons account for the lower quality evidence, such as a limited number of randomized controlled trials, lack of follow-up analysis or control group, and the presence of heterogeneity and publication bias. "
6956,2,"Nonetheless, evidence has shown that VR-based interventions for anxiety-related disorders display overall medium-to-large effects when compared with inactive controls but no significant difference when compared with standard evidence-based approaches. "
6957,2,"Preliminary data have highlighted that such effects appear to be sustained in time, and subjects may fare better than active controls. "
6958,2,"Neurocognitive disorders also appear to improve with VR-based approaches, with small effects being found for various clinical outcomes (eg, cognition, emotion). "
6959,2,"Finally, there are insufficient data to classify VR based interventions as an evidence-based practice for social skills training in neurodevelopmental disorders and compliance among patients with schizophrenia."
6960,3,VR provides unlimited opportunities by tailoring approaches to specific complex problems and individualizing the intervention. 
6961,3,"However, VR-based interventions have not shown superiority compared with usual evidence-based treatments. "
6962,3,Future VR-based interventions should focus on developing innovative approaches for complex and treatment-resistant symptoms that are difficult to address with traditional treatments. 
6963,3,Future research should also aim to gain a better understanding of the potential factors that may mediate VR outcomes to improve treatment.
6964,4,"Development and Feasibility of a Mobile Health-Supported Comprehensive Intervention Model (CIMmH) for Improving the Quality of Life of Patients With Esophageal Cancer After Esophagectomy: Prospective, Single-Arm, Nonrandomized Pilot Study"
6965,0,"Patients with esophageal cancer often experience clinically relevant deterioration of quality of life (QOL) after esophagectomy owing to malnutrition, lack of physical exercise, and psychological symptoms."
6966,1,Twenty patients with esophageal cancer undergoing the modified McKeown surgical procedure were invited to join the CIMmH program with both online and offline components for 12 weeks. 
6967,1,The participants were assessed before surgery and again at 1 and 3 months after esophagectomy. 
6968,1,"QOL, depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, nutrition, and physical fitness were measured."
6969,2,"Of the 20 patients, 16 (80%) completed the program. "
6970,2,"One month after esophagectomy, patients showed significant deterioration in overall QOL (P=.02), eating (P=.005), reflux (P=.04), and trouble with talking (P<.001). "
6971,2,"At the 3-month follow-up, except for pain (P=.02), difficulty with eating (P=.03), dry mouth (P=.04), and trouble with talking (P=.003), all other QOL dimensions returned to the preoperative level. "
6972,2,"There were significant reductions in weight (P<.001) and BMI (P=.02) throughout the study, and no significant changes were observed for physical fitness measured by change in the 6-minute walk distance between baseline and the 1-month follow-up (P=.22) or between baseline and the 3-month follow-up (P=.52). "
6973,2,"Depressive symptoms significantly increased 1 month after surgery (P<.001), while other psychological measures did not show relevant changes. "
6974,2,"Although there were declines in many measures 1 month after surgery, these were much improved at the 3-month follow-up, and the recovery was more profound and faster than with traditional rehabilitation programs."
6975,3,The CIMmH was feasible and safe and demonstrated encouraging efficacy testing with a control group for enhancing recovery after surgery among patients with esophageal cancer in China.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( ChiCTR- IPR-1800019900); http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=32811.
6976,4,Managing COVID-19 With a Clinical Decision Support Tool in a Community Health Network: Algorithm Development and Validation
6977,0,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to substantial public discussion. 
6978,0,"Understanding these discussions can help institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic."
6979,1,This study applied machine learning methods in the field of artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. 
6980,1,"Using tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the study examined COVID-19-related discussions. "
6981,1,"Social network and sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. "
6982,1,Geographic analysis of the tweets was also conducted.
6983,2,"There were a total of 14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies, 3,087,812 retweets, and 641,381 mentions in tweets during the study timeframe. "
6984,2,"Out of 902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified 434,254 (48.2%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7%) as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1%) as negative. "
6985,2,"The study identified 5 dominant themes among COVID-19-related tweets: health care environment, emotional support, business economy, social change, and psychological stress. "
6986,2,"Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the states expressing the most negative sentiment while Vermont, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most positive sentiment."
6987,3,This study identified 5 prevalent themes of COVID-19 discussion with sentiments ranging from positive to negative. 
6988,3,These themes and sentiments can clarify the public's response to COVID-19 and help officials navigate the pandemic.
6989,4,Characteristics of Twitter Use by State Medicaid Programs in the United States: Machine Learning Approach
6990,0,"Twitter is a potentially valuable tool for public health officials and state Medicaid programs in the United States, which provide public health insurance to 72 million Americans."
6991,1,"Using Twitter's public application programming interface, we collected 158,714 public posts (""tweets"") from active Twitter profiles of state Medicaid agencies and MCOs, spanning March 2014 through June 2019. "
6992,1,"Manual content analyses identified 5 broad categories of content, and these coded tweets were used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to classify all collected posts."
6993,2,We identified 15 state Medicaid agencies and 81 Medicaid MCOs on Twitter. 
6994,2,"The mean number of followers was 1784, the mean number of those followed was 542, and the mean number of posts was 2476. "
6995,2,Approximately 39% of tweets came from just 10 accounts. 
6996,2,"Of all posts, 39.8% (63,168/158,714) were classified as general public health education and outreach; 23.5% (n=37,298) were about specific Medicaid policies, programs, services, or events; 18.4% (n=29,203) were organizational promotion of staff and activities; and 11.6% (n=18,411) contained general news and news links Only 4.5% (n=7142) of posts were responses to specific questions, concerns, or complaints from the public."
6997,3,"Twitter has the potential to enhance community building, beneficiary engagement, and public health outreach, but appears to be underutilized by the Medicaid program."
6998,4,Factors Influencing the Smartphone Usage Behavior of Pedestrians: Observational Study on Spanish Smombies
6999,0,Smartphone addiction has become a reality accepted by all. 
7000,0,Some previous studies have shown that the use of smartphones on public roads while walking is very common among the young population. 
7001,0,"The term ""smombie"" or smartphone zombie has been coined for this behavior. "
7002,0,Such behavior causes a reduction in the attention given to other pedestrians and drivers and may result in accidents or collisions. 
7003,0,"However, there are no precise data about how many people use the phone while they are walking on the street. "
7004,0,"Smartphone usage habits are evolving rapidly, and more in-depth information is required, particularly about how users interact with their devices while walking: traditional phone conversations (phone close to the ear), voice chats (phone in front of the head), waiting for notifications (phone in hand), text chats (user touching the screen), etc. "
7005,0,This in-depth information may be useful for carrying out specific preventive actions in both the education field (raising awareness about the risks) and in the infrastructure field (redesigning the cities to increase safety).
7006,1,"An observational study of pedestrians in the street was carried out in Elche, a medium-sized Spanish city of 230,000 inhabitants. "
7007,1,"The following data were gathered: gender, age group, location, and type of smartphone interaction. "
7008,1,A specific smartphone app was developed to acquire data with high reliability. 
7009,1,"The statistical significance of each variable was evaluated using chi-squared tests, and Cramer's V statistic was used to measure the effect sizes. "
7010,1,Observer agreement was checked by the Cohen kappa analysis.
7011,2,"The behavior of 3301 pedestrians was analyzed, of which 1770 (53.6%) were females. "
7012,2,"As expected, the effect of the main variables studied was statistically significant, although with a small effect size: gender (P<.001, V=0.12), age (P<.001, V=0.18), and city area (P<.001, V=0.16). "
7013,2,"The phone in hand or ""holding"" behavior was particularly dependent on gender for all age groups (P<.001, V=0.09) and to a greater extent in young people (P<.001, V=0.16). "
7014,2,"Approximately 39.7% (222/559) of the young women observed showed ""holding"" or ""smombie"" behavior, and they comprised the highest proportion among all age and gender groups."
7015,3,An in-depth analysis of smartphone usage while walking revealed that certain population groups (especially young women) have a high risk of being involved in accidents due to smartphone usage. 
7016,3,Interventions aimed at reducing the risk of falls and collisions should be focused in these groups.
7017,4,Social Network Analysis of COVID-19 Sentiments: Application of Artificial Intelligence
7018,0,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. "
7019,0,"Wuhan had a much higher mortality rate than the rest of China However, a large number of asymptomatic infections in Wuhan may have never been diagnosed, contributing to an overestimated mortality rate."
7020,1,"In this study, we performed a combined analysis of the infection rate among evacuated foreign citizens to estimate the infection rate in Wuhan in late January and early February."
7021,2,"Based on our analysis, the combined infection rate of the foreign evacuees was 0.013 (95% CI 0.008-0.022). "
7022,2,"Therefore, we estimate the number of infected people in Wuhan to be 143,000 (range 88,000-242,000), which is significantly higher than previous estimates. "
7023,2,"Our study indicates that a large number of infections in Wuhan were not diagnosed, which has resulted in an overestimated case fatality rate."
7024,3,"Increased awareness of the original infection rate of Wuhan is critical for proper public health measures at all levels, as well as to eliminate panic caused by overestimated mortality rates that may bias health policy actions by the authorities."
7025,4,Conversational Agents in Health Care: Scoping Review and Conceptual Analysis
7026,0,"Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are computer programs designed to simulate human text or verbal conversations. "
7027,0,"They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. "
7028,0,"By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care."
7029,1,We performed a scoping review. 
7030,1,"A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms ""conversational agents,"" ""conversational AI,"" ""chatbots,"" and associated synonyms. "
7031,1,We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. 
7032,1,Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. 
7033,1,Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. 
7034,1,The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis.
7035,2,The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. 
7036,2,The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. 
7037,2,"Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. "
7038,2,"The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education."
7039,3,The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. 
7040,3,"It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence-driven, and smartphone app-delivered conversational agents. "
7041,3,"There is an urgent need for a robust evaluation of diverse health care conversational agents' formats, focusing on their acceptability, safety, and effectiveness."
7042,4,A Mobile Health Approach for Improving Outcomes in Suicide Prevention (SafePlan)
7043,0,"Suicide is a prominent cause of death worldwide, particularly among young people. "
7044,0,It was the second leading cause of death among those aged 15-29 years globally in 2016. 
7045,0,Treatment for patients with suicidal thoughts or behaviors often includes face-to-face psychological therapy with a mental health professional. 
7046,0,These forms of interventions may involve maintaining and updating paper-based reports or worksheets in between sessions. 
7047,0,Mobile technology can offer a way to support the implementation of evidence based psychological techniques and the acquisition of protective coping skills.
7048,1,A survey was distributed to targeted health care professionals to determine what features should be prioritized in a new mobile app relating to suicide prevention. 
7049,1,"On the basis of the survey results, a clinical design group, comprising 6 members with experience in fields such as mobile health (mHealth), clinical psychology, and suicide prevention, was established. "
7050,1,This group was supplemented with further input from additional clinicians who provided feedback over three focus group sessions. 
7051,1,The sessions were centered on refining existing app components and evaluating new feature requests. 
7052,1,This process was iterated through regular feedback until agreement was reached on the overall app design and functionality.
7053,2,"A fully functional mobile app, known as the SafePlan app, was developed and tested with the input of clinicians through an iterative design process. "
7054,2,The app's core function is to provide an interactive safety plan to support users with suicidal thoughts or behaviors as an adjunct to face-to-face therapy. 
7055,2,A diary component that facilitates the generalization of skills learned through dialectical behavior therapy was also implemented. 
7056,2,"Usability testing was carried out on the final prototype by students from a local secondary school, who are representative of the target user population in both age and technology experience. "
7057,2,The students were asked to complete a system usability survey (SUS) at the end of this session. 
7058,2,The mean overall SUS rating was 71.85 (SD 1.38).
7059,3,"The participatory process involving key stakeholders (clinicians, psychologists, and information technology specialists) has resulted in the creation of an mHealth intervention technology that has the potential to increase accessibility to this type of mental health service for the target population. "
7060,3,"The app has gone through the initial testing phase, and the relevant recommendations have been implemented, and it is now ready for trialing with both clinicians and their patients."
7061,4,"An Internet-Based Psychological Intervention With a Serious Game to Improve Vitality, Psychological and Physical Condition, and Immune Function in Healthy Male Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial"
7062,0,"Recently, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) and serious gaming interventions have been suggested to enhance accessibility to interventions and engagement in psychological interventions that aim to promote health outcomes. "
7063,0,"Few studies, however, have investigated their effectiveness in the context of simulated real-life challenges."
7064,1,"Sixty-nine healthy men were randomly assigned to the intervention condition, receiving ICBT combined with serious gaming for 6 weeks, or the control condition, receiving no intervention. "
7065,1,Self-reported vitality was the primary endpoint. 
7066,1,"Other self-reported psychophysiological and immunological endpoints were assessed following various challenges, including a bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination evoking pro-inflammatory responses, 1 and 4 weeks after the intervention period."
7067,2,"Although the intervention did not affect vitality-associated parameters, self-reported sleep problems (P=.027) and bodily sensations (P=.042) were lower directly after the intervention compared with controls. "
7068,2,"Furthermore, wellbeing (P=.024) was higher in the intervention group after the psychophysiological challenges. "
7069,2,"Although no significant group differences were found for the psychophysiological and immunological endpoints, the data provided preliminary support for increased immunoglobulin antibody responses at the follow-up time points (P<.05). "
7070,2,Differential chemokine endpoints between conditions were observed at the end of the test day.
7071,3,The present study provides some support for improving health endpoints with an innovative ICBT intervention. 
7072,3,Future research should replicate and further extend the present findings by consistently including challenges and a wide range of immune parameters into the study design.
7073,4,Racial and Ethnic Digital Divides in Posting COVID-19 Content on Social Media Among US Adults: Secondary Survey Analysis
7074,0,Public health surveillance experts are leveraging user-generated content on social media to track the spread and effects of COVID-19. 
7075,0,"However, racial and ethnic digital divides, which are disparities among people who have internet access and post on social media, can bias inferences. "
7076,0,"This bias is particularly problematic in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because due to structural inequalities, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately vulnerable to contracting the virus and to the deleterious economic and social effects from mitigation efforts. "
7077,0,"Further, important demographic intersections with race and ethnicity, such as gender and age, are rarely investigated in work characterizing social media users; however, they reflect additional axes of inequality shaping differential exposure to COVID-19 and its effects."
7078,1,"We performed a secondary analysis of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from March 19 to 24, 2020, using a national probability sample (N=10,510). "
7079,1,"Respondents were recruited from an online panel, where panelists without an internet-enabled device were given one to keep at no cost. "
7080,1,"The binary dependent variable was responses to an item asking whether respondents ""used social media to share or post information about the coronavims."" We used survey-weighted logistic regressions to estimate the odds of responding in the affirmative based on the race and ethnicity of respondents (white, black, Latino, other race/ethnicity), adjusted for covariates measuring sociodemographic background and COVID-19 experiences. "
7081,1,"We examined how gender (female, male) and age (18 to 30 years, 31 to 50 years, 51 to 64 years, and 65 years and older) intersected with race and ethnicity by estimating interactions."
7082,2,"Respondents who identified as black (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64; P=.03), Latino (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-2.04; P<.001), or other races/ethnicities (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.72; P=.03) had higher odds than respondents who identified as white of reporting that they posted COVID-19 content on social media. "
7083,2,"Women had higher odds of posting than men regardless of race and ethnicity (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.39-1.80; P<.001). "
7084,2,"Among men, respondents who identified as black, Latino, or members of other races/ethnicities were significantly more likely to post than respondents who identified as white. "
7085,2,"Older adults (65 years or older) had significantly lower odds (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.94; P=.01) of posting compared to younger adults (18-29 years), particularly among those identifying as other races/ethnicities. "
7086,2,Latino respondents were the most likely to report posting across all age groups.
7087,3,"In the United States, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are most likely to contribute to COVID-19 content on social media, particularly among groups traditionally less likely to use social media (older adults and men). "
7088,3,The next step is to ensure that data collection procedures capture this diversity by encompassing a breadth of search criteria and social media platforms.
7089,4,Therapeutic Alliance in Technology-Based Interventions for the Treatment of Depression: Systematic Review
7090,0,There is growing evidence that technology based interventions (TBIs) are effective for the treatment of depression. 
7091,0,"As TBIs are gaining acceptance, a question arises whether good therapeutic alliance, considered a key aspect of psychotherapy, can be established without or with minimal face-to-face contact or rather changes if blended concepts are applied. "
7092,0,"While therapeutic alliance has been studied extensively in the context of face-to-face therapy, only few studies have reviewed evidence on alliance ratings in TBIs."
7093,1,"We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, CINAHL, clinical trial registers, and sources of grey literature for randomized controlled trials on TBIs in the treatment of adults with unipolar depression. "
7094,1,All publications were selected according to pre specified criteria. 
7095,1,Data were extracted by two independent reviewers.
7096,2,A total of eight out of 98 studies (9.5%) included in the review on TBIs for depression considered therapeutic alliance as part of their evaluation. 
7097,2,"The available data covered eight different treatment conditions, including four stand-alone treatments (face-to-face psychotherapy, email, telephone, and internet program) and four combined treatments (face-to-face psychotherapy plus a smartphone app and an internet program combined with face-to-face psychotherapy, treatment as usual, or email/telephone). "
7098,2,"On average, patients rated the alliance positively across all groups. "
7099,2,"Importantly, no relevant group differences regarding therapeutic alliance sum scores were found in any of the studies. "
7100,2,"Five studies investigated the relationship between patients' alliance ratings and treatment outcome, revealing mixed results."
7101,3,"Our results suggest that it is possible to establish a positive therapeutic alliance across a variety of different TBIs for depression, but this is based on a small number of studies. "
7102,3,"Future research needs to determine on what basis therapeutic alliance is formed in settings that do not allow for additional nonverbal cues, perhaps with adapted instruments to measure therapeutic alliance."
7103,4,Physiotherapy With Telerehabilitation in Patients With Complicated Postoperative Recovery After Esophageal Cancer Surgery: Feasibility Study
7104,0,Improvement of functional status with physiotherapy is an important goal for patients with postoperative complications and an increased length of hospital stay (LoS) after esophagectomy. 
7105,0,"Supervised physiotherapy with telerehabilitation instead of conventional face-to-face care could be an alternative to treat these patients in their home environment after hospital discharge (T0), but its feasibility has not yet been investigated in detail."
7106,1,A prospective feasibility study with a matched historical comparison group was performed. 
7107,1,"Feasibility outcomes included willingness and adherence to participate, refusal rate, treatment duration, occurrence of adverse events, and patient satisfaction. "
7108,1,"Secondary outcome measures were measurements of musculoskeletal and cardiovascular functions and activities according to the domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health."
7109,2,A total of 22 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy and had postoperative complications or an increased LoS were included. 
7110,2,"The mean age at surgery was 64.55 (SD 6.72) years, and 77% (17/22) of patients were male. "
7111,2,"Moreover, 15 patients completed the intervention. "
7112,2,"Patient adherence was 99.8% in the first 6 weeks and dropped to 75.6% in the following 6 weeks, with a mean difference of -24.3% (95% CI 1.3 to 47.2; P=.04). "
7113,2,"At 3 months post operation, no differences in functional status were found between the intervention group and the matched historical comparison group."
7114,3,This study showed that a postoperative physiotherapeutic intervention with telerehabilitation is feasible for patients with postoperative complications or an increased LoS after esophageal cancer surgery up to 6 weeks after T0.
7115,4,The Role of Psychological Factors in Older Adults Readiness to Use eHealth Technology: Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study
7116,0,Information and communication technology (ICT) use among older adults has been on the rise in recent years. 
7117,0,"However, the predictors and mechanisms behind older adults' acceptance and use of ICT are not clear."
7118,1,The research utilized cross-sectional survey data from a quota-based sample of Czech older adults (>50 years) and persons close to them further referred to as close persons (N=250 dyads). 
7119,1,"A structural equation modeling framework was used to evaluate relationships between psychological factors, ICT use, and eHealth readiness."
7120,2,"Czech older adults' use of ICT is low with the exception of cell phone usage (cell phone usage by 173/250, 69.2%; other devices used by 50/250, 20.0% of older adults or less). "
7121,2,"Apart from age (beta=-.21; P<.001), eHealth readiness was predicted by ICT use (beta=.65; P<.001). "
7122,2,eHealth readiness was also indirectly affected by the need for cognitive closure (NFCC): individuals with a high need for closure perceived more barriers to ICT (beta=.23; P=.01) and more reported barriers were linked to lower ICT usage (beta=-.21; P=.001). 
7123,2,"The expected positive relationships between eHealth readiness of persons close to older adults and ICT use and eHealth readiness of older adults were not significant, but the total effect of eHealth readiness of persons close to older adults on eHealth readiness of older adults was positive and significant (beta=.18; P=.01), indicating some level of influence of persons close to them on older adults' attitudes and behaviors."
7124,3,This study provided the first systematic examination of Czech older adults' ICT usage and eHealth readiness. 
7125,3,Novel predictors (NFCC and close persons' variables) were evaluated and yielded actionable results. 
7126,3,More research is needed to clarify the role of persons close to older adults.
7127,4,Internet-Based Health Information-Seeking Behavior of Students Aged 12 to 14 Years: Mixed Methods Study
7128,0,"Many children and adolescents are surrounded by smartphones, tablets, and computers and know how to search the internet for almost any information. "
7129,0,"However, very few of them know how to select proper information from reliable sources. "
7130,0,"This can become a problem when health issues are concerned, where it is vital to identify incorrect or misleading information. "
7131,0,The competence to critically evaluate digital information on health issues is of increasing importance for adolescents.
7132,1,A workshop with a focus on health literacy was attended by 14 children and adolescents in an Austrian secondary school. 
7133,1,"After prior assessments (Culture Fair Intelligence Test, revised German version; Reading Speed and Reading Comprehension Test for Grades 6 to 12, German; electronic health literacy scale [eHEALS]; and General Self-Efficacy Scale, Reversed Version, German), the students were asked to perform an internet-based search on a health-related issue. "
7134,1,"Browser histories and screenshots of all internet searches were gathered, clustered, and analyzed. "
7135,1,"After the workshop, the health literacy of the students was assessed again by using the eHEALS."
7136,2,"The 14 students opened a total of 85 homepages, but only eight of these homepages were rated as good or fair by two experts (independent rating) based on specific criteria. "
7137,2,"The analysis showed that the students judged their own internet-based health literacy much higher than the actual value, and students who had rated themselves better did not visit websites of high quality. "
7138,2,"Internet-based health literacy correlated significantly with the self-efficacy of the students (r(s) =0.794, P=.002)."
7139,3,Our study showed that it is possible to draw the attention of students to critical aspects of internet search and to slightly improve their search competence in a workshop. 
7140,3,"Targeted improvement of health literacy is urgently required, and students need special instruction for this purpose. "
7141,3,"Further investigations in this area with larger sets of data, which could be feasible with the help of a computer program, are urgently needed."
7142,4,An Exploration Into the Use of a Chatbot for Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Retrospective Cohort Study
7143,0,The emergence of chatbots in health care is fast approaching. 
7144,0,Data on the feasibility of chatbots for chronic disease management are scarce.
7145,1,"Electronic dialog data collected between 2013 and 2018 from a care management platform (UCLA eIBD) at a tertiary referral center for IBD at the University of California, Los Angeles, were used. "
7146,1,"Part of the data was manually reviewed, and an algorithm for categorization was created. "
7147,1,The algorithm categorized all relevant dialogs into a set number of categories using NLP. 
7148,1,"In addition, 3 independent physicians evaluated the appropriateness of the categorization."
7149,2,"A total of 16,453 lines of dialog were collected and analyzed. "
7150,2,We categorized 8324 messages from 424 patients into seven categories. 
7151,2,"As there was an overlap in these categories, their frequencies were measured independently as symptoms (2033/6193, 32.83%), medications (2397/6193, 38.70%), appointments (1518/6193, 24.51%), laboratory investigations (2106/6193, 34.01%), finance or insurance (447/6193, 7.22%), communications (2161/6193, 34.89%), procedures (617/6193, 9.96%), and miscellaneous (624/6193, 10.08%). "
7152,2,"Furthermore, in 95.0% (285/300) of cases, there were minor or no differences in categorization between the algorithm and the three independent physicians."
7153,3,"With increased adaptation of electronic health technologies, chatbots could have great potential in interacting with patients, collecting data, and increasing efficiency. "
7154,3,Our categorization showcases the feasibility of using NLP in large amounts of electronic dialog for the development of a chatbot algorithm. 
7155,3,Chatbots could allow for the monitoring of patients beyond consultations and potentially empower and educate patients and improve clinical outcomes.
7156,4,A Cross-Cultural Comparison of an Extended Planned Risk Information Seeking Model on Mental Health Among College Students: Cross-Sectional Study
7157,0,"Approximately 42 5 million adults have been affected by mental illness in the United States in 2013, and 173 million people have been affected by a diagnosable psychiatric disorder in China An increasing number of people tend to seek health information on the Web, and it is important to understand the factors associated with individuals' mental health information seeking. "
7158,0,Identifying factors associated with mental health information seeking may influence the disease progression of potential patients. 
7159,0,The planned risk information seeking model (PRISM) was developed in 2010 by integrating multiple information seeking models including the theory of planned behavior. 
7160,0,Few studies have replicated PRISM outside the United States and no previous study has examined mental health as a personal risk in different cultures.
7161,1,Data were collected in both countries using the same online survey through a survey management program (Qualifies). 
7162,1,"In China, college instructors distributed the survey link among university students, and it was also posted on a leading social media site called Sina Weibo. "
7163,1,"In the United States, the data were collected in a college-wide survey pool in a large Northwestern university."
7164,2,The final sample size was 235 for the Chinese sample and 241 for the US sample. 
7165,2,"Media use was significantly associated with mental health information-seeking intentions in the Chinese sample (P<.001), and cultural identity was significantly associated with intentions in both samples (China: P=.02; United States: P<.001). "
7166,2,The extended PRISM had a better model fit than the original PRISM.
7167,3,Cultural identity and media use should be considered when evaluating the process of mental health information seeking or when designing interventions to address mental health information seeking.
7168,4,"Supporting Self-Management of Cardiovascular Diseases Through Remote Monitoring Technologies: Metaethnography Review of Frameworks, Models, and Theories Used in Research and Development"
7169,0,Electronic health (eHealth) is a rapidly evolving field informed by multiple scientific disciplines. 
7170,0,"Because of this, the use of different terms and concepts to explain the same phenomena and lack of standardization in reporting interventions often leaves a gap that hinders knowledge accumulation. "
7171,0,Interventions focused on self-management support of cardiovascular diseases through the use of remote monitoring technologies are a cross-disciplinary area potentially affected by this gap. 
7172,0,"A review of the underlying frameworks, models, and theories that have informed projects at this crossroad could advance future research and development efforts."
7173,1,"The metaethnography approach was used to review and synthesize researchers' reports on how they applied frameworks, models, and theories in their projects. "
7174,1,"Literature was systematically searched in 7 databases: Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and Cochrane Library. "
7175,1,Included studies were thoroughly read and coded to extract data for the synthesis. 
7176,1,Studies were mainly related by the key ingredients of the underlying approaches they applied. 
7177,1,The key ingredients were finally translated across studies and synthesized into thematic clusters.
7178,2,"Of 1224 initial results, 17 articles were included. "
7179,2,The articles described research and development of 10 different projects. 
7180,2,"Frameworks, models, and theories (n=43) applied by the projects were identified. "
7181,2,"Key ingredients (n=293) of the included articles were mapped to the following themes of eHealth development: (1) it is a participatory process; (2) it creates new infrastructures for improving health care, health, and well-being; (3) it is intertwined with implementation; (4) it integrates theory, evidence, and participatory approaches for persuasive design; (5) it requires continuous evaluation cycles; (6) it targets behavior change; (7) it targets technology adoption; and (8) it targets health-related outcomes."
7182,3,"The findings of this review support and exemplify the numerous possibilities in the use of frameworks, models, and theories to guide research and development of eHealth. "
7183,3,"Participatory, user-centered design, and integration with empirical evidence and theoretical modeling were widely identified principles in the literature. "
7184,3,"On the contrary, less attention has been given to the integration of implementation in the development process and supporting novel eHealth-based health care infrastructures. "
7185,3,"To better integrate theory and evidence, holistic approaches can combine patient-centered studies with consolidated knowledge from expert-based approaches."
7186,4,An Informatics Framework to Assess Consumer Health Language Complexity Differences: Proof-of-Concept Study
7187,0,The language gap between health consumers and health professionals has been long recognized as the main hindrance to effective health information comprehension. 
7188,0,"Although providing health information access in consumer health language (CHL) is widely accepted as the solution to the problem, health consumers are found to have varying health language preferences and proficiencies. "
7189,0,"To simplify health documents for heterogeneous consumer groups, it is important to quantify how CHLs are different in terms of complexity among various consumer groups."
7190,1,"We examined posts with more than 4 sentences of each user from 3 health forums to understand CHL complexity differences among these groups: 12,560 posts from 3756 users in Yahoo! "
7191,1,"Answers, 25,545 posts from 1623 users in AllDeaf, and 26,484 posts from 2751 users in Wrong Planet. "
7192,1,"We calculated CHELCS for each user and compared the scores of 3 user groups (ie, deaf and hearing-impaired people, people with ASD, and the public) through 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and analysis of covariance tests."
7193,2,"The results suggest that users in the public forum used more complex CHL, particularly more diverse semantics and more complex health terms compared with users in the ASD and deaf and hearing-impaired user forums. "
7194,2,"However, between the latter 2 groups, people with ASD used more complex words, and deaf and hearing-impaired users used more complex syntax."
7195,3,Our results show that the users in 3 online forums had significantly different CHL complexities in different facets. 
7196,3,The proposed framework and detailed measurements help to quantify these CHL complexity differences comprehensively. 
7197,3,The results emphasize the importance of tailoring health-related content for different consumer groups with varying CHL complexities.
7198,4,"Containing COVID-19 Among 627,386 Persons in Contact With the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship Passengers Who Disembarked in Taiwan: Big Data Analytics"
7199,0,Low infection and case-fatality rates have been thus far observed in Taiwan. 
7200,0,One of the reasons for this major success is better use of big data analytics in efficient contact tracing and management and surveillance of those who require quarantine and isolation.
7201,1,"The smart contact tracing-based mobile sensor data, cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data, were analyzed by the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis to identify 627,386 potential contact-persons. "
7202,1,"Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via SMS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were offered for symptomatic contacts. "
7203,1,"National Health Insurance claims big data were linked, to follow-up on the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to undergo screening for SARS-CoV-2."
7204,2,"As of February 29, a total of 67 contacts who were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 cases were found. "
7205,2,"Less cases of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia were found after the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until March 10, 2020."
7206,3,"Big data analytics with smart contact tracing, automated alert messaging for self-restriction, and follow-up of the outcome related to COVID-19 using health insurance data could curtail the resources required for conventional epidemiological contact tracing."
7207,4,A Facilitated Web-Based Self-Management Tool for People With Type 1 Diabetes Using an Insulin Pump: Intervention Development Using the Behavior Change Wheel and Theoretical Domains Framework
7208,0,Type 1 diabetes (T1D) requires intensive self-management (SM). 
7209,0,"An insulin pump is designed to better support personal T1D management, but at the same time, it exacerbates the complexity and requirements of SM. "
7210,0,"Research shows that people with diabetes are likely to benefit from navigating and connecting to local means of social support and resources through web-based interventions that offer flexible, innovative, and accessible SM. "
7211,0,"However, questions remain as to which behavior change mechanisms within such resources benefit patients most and how to foster engagement with and endorsement of SM interventions."
7212,1,Focus groups with insulin pump users (n=19) and specialist HCPs (n=20) in 6 National Health Service (NHS) trusts across the south of England examined the barriers and enablers to incorporating and self-managing an insulin pump. 
7213,1,"An analysis was undertaken using the Behavior Change Wheel and Theoretical Domains Framework, followed by a taxonomy of behavior change techniques (BCTs) to identify the contents of and strategies for the implementation of a complex health intervention."
7214,2,"A total of 4 themes represent the SM perspectives and experiences of stakeholders: (1) a desire for access to tailored and appropriate resources and information-the support and information required for successful SM are situational and contextual, and these vary according to time and life circumstances, and therefore, these need to be tailored and appropriate; (2) specific social support preferences-taking away isolation as well as providing shared learnings and practical tips, but limitations included the fear of judgment from others and self-pity from peers; (3) the environmental context, that is, capacity and knowledge of pump clinic HCPs-HCPs acknowledge the patient's need for holistic support but lack confidence in providing it; and (4) professional responsibility and associated risks and dangers, whereas HCPs are fearful of the consequences of promoting non-NHS SM support, and they question whether SM support fits into their role. "
7215,2,BCTs were identified to address these issues.
7216,3,The use of behavioral theory and a validated implementation framework provided a comprehensive approach for systematically identifying barriers and enablers of self-managing T1D with an insulin pump. 
7217,3,A web-based SN intervention appears to offer additional forms of SM support while complementing NHS services. 
7218,3,"However, for intervention implementation, HCPs' apprehensions about responsibility when signposting to non-NHS SM support would need to be addressed, and opportunistic features would need to be added, through which pump users could actively engage with other people living with T1D."
7219,4,"Cloud-Based System for Effective Surveillance and Control of COVID-19: Useful Experiences From Hubei, China"
7220,0,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been an unprecedented challenge to the global health care system. 
7221,0,Tools that can improve the focus of surveillance efforts and clinical decision support are of paramount importance.
7222,1,"The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization, and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social media on mobile devices."
7223,2,"HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients. "
7224,2,"The syndromic surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic emergencies. "
7225,2,The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources. 
7226,2,"However, the statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which warrants further investigation."
7227,3,The facilitating factors and challenges are discussed to provide useful insights to other cities to build suitable solutions based on cloud technologies. 
7228,3,"The HHS for COVID-19 was shown to be feasible and effective in this real-world field study, and has the potential to be migrated."
7229,4,How Behavior Change Strategies are Used to Design Digital Interventions to Improve Medication Adherence and Blood Pressure Among Patients With Hypertension: Systematic Review
7230,0,Information on how behavior change strategies have been used to design digital interventions (DIs) to improve blood pressure (BP) control or medication adherence (MA) for patients with hypertension is currently limited.
7231,1,We included all the studies regarding DI development to improve MA or BP control for patients with hypertension published in PubMed from 2008 to 2018. 
7232,1,All the DI components were mapped into a matrix of change objectives using the Intervention Mapping technique by eliciting the key determinant factors (from patient and health care team and system levels) and targeted patient behaviors.
7233,2,The analysis included 54 eligible studies. 
7234,2,The determinants were considered at two levels: patient and health care team and system. 
7235,2,"The most commonly described determinants at the patient level were lack of education, lack of self-awareness, lack of self-efficacy, and forgetfulness. "
7236,2,Clinical inertia and an inadequate health workforce were the most commonly targeted determinants at the health care team and system level. 
7237,2,"Taking medication, interactive patient-provider communication, self-measurement, and lifestyle management were the most cited patient behaviors at both levels. "
7238,2,"Most of the DIs did not include support from peers or family members, despite its reported effectiveness and the rate of social media penetration."
7239,3,"This review highlights the need to design a multifaceted DI that can be personalized according to patient behavior(s) that need to be changed to overcome the key determinant(s) of low adherence to medication or uncontrolled BP among patients with hypertension, considering different levels including patient and healthcare team and system involvement."
7240,4,Fibromyalgia Impact Reduction Using Online Personal Health Informatics: Longitudinal Observational Study
7241,0,Personal health informatics have the potential to help patients discover personalized health management strategies that influence outcomes. 
7242,0,Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex chronic illness requiring individualized strategies that may be informed by analysis of personal health informatics data. 
7243,0,"An online health diary program with dynamic feedback was developed to assist patients with FM in identifying symptom management strategies that predict their personal outcomes, and found reduced symptom levels associated with program use."
7244,1,Participants were self-identified as diagnosed with FM and recruited via online FM advocacy websites. 
7245,1,"Participants used an online health diary program (""SMARTLog"") to report symptom ratings, behaviors, and management strategies used. "
7246,1,"Based on single-subject analysis of the accumulated data over time, individualized recommendations (""SMARTProfile"") were then provided by the automated feedback program. "
7247,1,Indices of program use comprised of cumulative numbers of SMARTLogs completed and SMARTProfiles received. 
7248,1,"Participants included in this analysis met a priori criteria of sufficient program use to generate SMARTProfiles (ie, >= 22 SMARTLogs completed). "
7249,1,Users completed the FIQ at baseline and again each subsequent month of program use as follow-up data for analysis. 
7250,1,"Kendall tau-b, a nonparametric statistic that measures both the strength and direction of an ordinal association between two repeated measured variables, was computed between all included FIQ scores and both indices of program use for each subject at the time of each completed FIQ."
7251,2,A total of 76 users met the a priori use criteria. 
7252,2,The mean baseline FIQ score was 61.6 (SD 14.7). 
7253,2,There were 342 FIQ scores generated for longitudinal analysis via Kendall tau-b. 
7254,2,"Statistically significant inverse associations were found over time between FIQ scores and (1) the cumulative number of SMARTLogs completed (tau-b=-0.135, P<.001); and (2) the cumulative number of SMARTProfiles received (tau-b=-0.133, P<.001). "
7255,2,"Users who completed 61 or more SMARTLogs had mean follow-up scores of 49.9 (n=25, 33% of the sample), an 18.9% drop in FM impact. "
7256,2,"Users who generated 11 or more new SMARTProfiles had mean follow-up scores of 51.8 (n=23, 30% of the sample), a 15.9% drop."
7257,3,"Significant inverse associations were found between FIQ scores and both indices of program use, with FIQ scores declining as use increased. "
7258,3,"Based on established criteria for rating FM severity, the top one-third of users in terms of use had clinically significant reductions from ""severe"" to ""moderate"" FM impact. "
7259,3,"These findings underscore the value of self-management interventions with low burden, high usability, and high perceived relevance to the user."
7260,4,Exploring Abnormal Behavior Patterns of Online Users With Emotional Eating Behavior: Topic Modeling Study
7261,0,Emotional eating (EE) is one of the most significant symptoms of various eating disorders. 
7262,0,"It has been difficult to collect a large amount of behavioral data on EE; therefore, only partial studies of this symptom have been conducted. "
7263,0,"To provide adequate support for online social media users with symptoms of EE, we must understand their behavior patterns to design a sophisticated personalized support system (PSS)."
7264,1,The machine learning (ML) framework and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling tool were used to collect and analyze behavioral data on EE. 
7265,1,"Data from a subcommunity of Reddit, /r/loseit, were analyzed. "
7266,1,"This dataset included all posts and feedback from July 2014 to May 2018, comprising 185,950 posts and 3,528,107 comments. "
7267,1,"In addition, deleted and improperly collected data were eliminated. "
7268,1,Stochastic gradient descent-based ML classifier with an accuracy of 90.64% was developed to collect refined behavioral data of online users with EE behaviors. 
7269,1,The expert group that labeled the dataset to train the ML classifiers included a medical doctor specializing in EE diagnosis and a nutritionist with profound knowledge of EE behavior. 
7270,1,The experts labeled 5126 posts as EE (coded as 1) or others (coded as 0). 
7271,1,"Finally, the topic modeling process was conducted with LDA."
7272,2,"The following 4 macroperspective topics of online EE behaviors were identified through linguistic evidence regarding each topic: addressing feelings, sharing physical changes, sharing and asking for dietary information, and sharing dietary strategies. "
7273,2,"The 5 main topics of feedback were dietary information, compliments, consolation, automatic bot feedback, and health information. "
7274,2,The feedback topic distribution significantly differed depending on the type of EE behavior (overall P<.001).
7275,3,This study introduces a data-driven approach for analyzing behavior patterns of social website users with EE behaviors. 
7276,3,We discovered the possibility of the LDA topic model as an exploratory user study method for abnormal behaviors in medical research. 
7277,3,"We also investigated the possibilities of ML- and topic modeling-based classifiers to automatically categorize text-based behavioral data, which could be applied to personalized medicine in future research."
7278,4,Social Comparison Features in Physical Activity Promotion Apps: Scoping Meta-Review
7279,0,"Smartphone apps promoting physical activity (PA) are abundant, but few produce substantial and sustained behavior change. "
7280,0,"Although many PA apps purport to induce users to compare themselves with others (by invoking social comparison processes), improvements in PA and other health behaviors are inconsistent. "
7281,0,Existing literature suggests that social comparison may motivate PA for some people under some circumstances. 
7282,0,"However, 2 aspects of work that apply social comparison theory to PA apps remain unclear: (1) how comparison processes have been operationalized or harnessed in existing PA apps and (2) whether incorporating sources of variability in response to comparison have been used to tailor comparison features of apps, which could improve their effectiveness for promoting PA."
7283,1,"We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO for reviews of PA smartphone apps. "
7284,1,"Of the 3743 initial articles returned, 26 reviews met the inclusion criteria. "
7285,1,"Two independent raters extracted the data from these reviews, including the definition of social comparison used to categorize app features, the percentage of apps categorized as inducing comparison, specific features intended to induce comparison, and any mention of tailoring comparison features. "
7286,1,"For reference, these data were also extracted for related processes (such as behavioral modeling, norm referencing, and social networking)."
7287,2,"Of the included review articles, 31% (8/26) categorized app features as prompting social comparison. "
7288,2,"The majority of these employed Abraham and Michie's earliest definition of comparison, which differs from versions in later iterations of the same taxonomy. "
7289,2,"Very few reviews specified what dimension users were expected to compare (eg, steps, physical fitness) or which features of the apps were used to induce comparison (eg, leaderboards, message boards). "
7290,2,No review referenced tailoring of comparison features. 
7291,2,"In contrast, 54% (14/26) reviews categorized features for prompting behavioral modeling and 31% (8/26) referenced tailoring app features for users' personal goals or preferences."
7292,3,"The heterogeneity across reviews of PA apps and the absence of relevant information (eg, about dimensions or features relevant for comparison) create confusion about how to best harness social comparison to increase PA and its effectiveness in future research. "
7293,3,"No evidence was found that important findings from the broader social comparison literature (eg, that people have differing preferences for and responses to social comparison information) have been incorporated in the design of existing PA apps. "
7294,3,"Greater integration of the mobile health (mHealth) and social comparison literatures may improve the effectiveness of PA apps, thereby increasing the public health impact of these mHealth tools.International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): RR2-https://osf.io/nh4td/"
7295,4,Feasibility of an Electronic Health Tool to Promote Physical Activity in Primary Care: Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial
7296,0,Physical inactivity is associated with increased health risks. 
7297,0,Primary care providers (PCPs) are well positioned to support increased physical activity (PA) levels through screening and provision of PA prescriptions. 
7298,0,"However, PCP counseling on PA is not common."
7299,1,A pragmatic pilot study was conducted using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design. 
7300,1,"The study was conducted at a single primary care clinic, with 4 pre-existing PCP teams. "
7301,1,Adult patients who had a periodic health review (PHR) scheduled during the study period were invited to participate. 
7302,1,The eHealth tool involved an electronic survey sent to participants before their PHR via an email or a tablet; data were used to automatically produce tailored resources and a PA prescription in the electronic medical record of participants in the intervention arm. 
7303,1,Participants assigned to the control arm received usual care from their PCP. 
7304,1,Feasibility was assessed by the proportion of completed surveys and patient-reported acceptability and fidelity measures. 
7305,1,"The primary effectiveness outcome was patient-reported PA at 4 months post-PHR, measured as metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week. "
7306,1,"Secondary outcomes assessed determinants of PA, including self-efficacy and intention to change based on the Health Action Process Approach behavior change theory."
7307,2,A total of 1028 patients receiving care from 34 PCPs were invited to participate and 530 (51.55%) consented (intervention [n=296] and control [n=234]). 
7308,2,"Of the participants who completed a process evaluation, almost half (88/178, 49.4%) stated they received a PA prescription, with only 42 receiving the full intervention including tailored resources from their PCP. "
7309,2,A cluster-level linear regression analysis yielded a non-statistically significant positive difference in MET-minutes reported per week at follow-up between intervention and control conditions (mean difference 1027; 95% CI -155 to 2209; P=.09). 
7310,2,No statistically significant differences were observed for secondary outcomes.
7311,3,Our results suggest that it is feasible to build an eHealth tool that screens and provides tailored resources for PA in a primary care setting but suboptimal intervention fidelity suggests greater work must be done to address PCP barriers to resource distribution. 
7312,3,"Participant responses to the primary effectiveness outcome (MET-minutes) were highly variable, reflecting a need for more robust measures of PA in future trials to address limitations in patient-reported data."
7313,4,Efficacy of an Electronic Health Management Program for Patients With Cardiovascular Risk: Randomized Controlled Trial
7314,0,"In addition to medication, health behavior management is crucial in patients with multiple risks of cardiovascular mortality."
7315,1,"A 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of Smart Healthing in 106 patients with at least one indicator of poor disease control and who had hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia. "
7316,1,"The intervention group (n=53) took part in the electronic program, which was available in the form of a mobile app and a Web-based PC application. "
7317,1,"The program covered 4 areas: self-assessment, self-planning, self-learning, and self-monitoring by automatic feedback. "
7318,1,The control group (n=53) received basic educational material concerning disease control. 
7319,1,"The primary outcome was the percentage of participants who achieved their clinical indicator goal after 12 weeks into the program: glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) <7.0%, systolic blood pressure (SBP) <140 mmHg, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <130 mg/dL."
7320,2,The intervention group showed a significantly higher success rate (in comparison with the control group) for achieving each of 3 clinical indicators at the targeted goal levels (P<.05). 
7321,2,Only the patients with hypertension showed a significant improvement in SBP from the baseline as compared with the control group (72.7% vs 35.7%; P<.05). 
7322,2,"There was a significant reduction in HbA(1c), in the intervention group compared with the control group (difference=0.54%; p <= .05). "
7323,2,"In the intervention group, 20% of patients with diabetes exhibited a >= 1% decrease in HbA(1c )(vs 0% among controls; P <= .05)."
7324,3,A short-term self-management strategy-based electronic program intervention may improve clinical outcomes among patients with cardiovascular risks.
7325,4,Patient Recommendations to Improve the Implementation of and Engagement With Portals in Acute Care: Hospital-Based Qualitative Study
7326,0,The inclusion of patient portals into electronic health records in the inpatient setting lags behind progress in the outpatient setting.
7327,1,We utilized a mixed methods approach to explore patient experiences in using the portal during hospitalization. 
7328,1,"All patients received a tablet with a brief tutorial, pre- and postuse surveys, and completed in-person semistructured interviews. "
7329,1,Qualitative data were coded using thematic analysis to iteratively develop 18 codes that were integrated into 3 themes framed as patient recommendations to hospitals to improve engagement with the portal during acute care. 
7330,1,Themes from these qualitative data guided our approach to the analysis of quantitative data.
7331,2,"We enrolled 97 participants: 53 (53/97, 55%) women, 44 (44/97, 45%) nonwhite with an average age of 48 years (19-81 years), and the average length of hospitalization was 6.4 days. "
7332,2,"A total of 47 participants (47/97, 48%) had an active portal account, 59 participants (59/97, 61%) owned a smartphone, and 79 participants (79/97, 81%) accessed the internet daily. "
7333,2,"In total, 3 overarching themes emerged from the qualitative analysis of interviews with these patients during their hospital stay: (1) hospitals should provide both access to a device and bring-your-own-device platform to access the portal; (2) hospitals should provide an orientation both on how to use the device and how to use the portal; and (3) hospitals should ensure portal content is up to date and easy to understand."
7334,3,"Patients independently and consistently identified basic needs for device and portal access, education, and usability. "
7335,3,Hospitals should prioritize these areas to enable successful implementation of inpatient portals to promote greater patient engagement during acute care.
7336,4,An Online Pain Education Program for Working Adults: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
7337,0,"Pain is a common public health concern, and the pain situation among the general population is serious in mainland China Working adults commonly experience pain because of long sitting times, a lack of free time, and exercise. "
7338,0,A lack of pain-related knowledge is also a significant factor. 
7339,0,"Educational and therapeutic programs delivered online were used more often in Western countries, and accessible programs in China are limited, especially for pain management. "
7340,0,"Therefore, we carried out an online pain education program for working adults to self-manage pain. "
7341,0,"The program was delivered through WeChat, a popular and secure social media with a large population base in China."
7342,1,This was a randomized controlled trial. 
7343,1,"Chinese adults aged between 16 and 60 years with full-time employment, with pain in the past 6 months, and without any mental illness were recruited using snowball sampling through the internet and were randomly allocated to an experimental group and a control group in 1:1 ratio after the baseline assessment. "
7344,1,"The 4-week educational program that included basic knowledge of pain, pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, and related resources was provided only to the experimental group. "
7345,1,"Outcomes of pain, depression, anxiety, stress, and pain self-efficacy were measured at baseline (T0), posttreatment (T1), and 1-month follow-up (T2). "
7346,1,Participants' acceptability and satisfaction were explored after completing the educational program.
7347,2,"In total, 95 eligible participants joined in the program: 47 in the experimental group and 48 in the control group. "
7348,2,"Neck and shoulder, head, and back were most commonly reported pain sites with high pain scores. "
7349,2,Pain intensity and interference of the experimental group were significantly reduced after the educational program. 
7350,2,"Depression, anxiety, and stress clinically improved and pain self-efficacy improved after the educational program. "
7351,2,"The difference in depression, anxiety, stress, and pain self-efficacy within a group or between groups was not statistically significant; however, clinical improvements were demonstrated. "
7352,2,A significant correlation between dosage of the intervention and pain intensity and depression was demonstrated. 
7353,2,"After completing the educational program, more than half of the participants showed acceptance of and satisfaction with the program, and they were willing to recommend the program to others."
7354,3,Our findings highlight the significant potential of this online education program in the treatment of pain.
7355,4,Assessing the Psychometric Properties of the Digital Behavior Change Intervention Engagement Scale in Users of an App for Reducing Alcohol Consumption: Evaluation Study
7356,0,"The level and type of engagement with digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) are likely to influence their effectiveness, but validated self-report measures of engagement are lacking. "
7357,0,"The DBCI Engagement Scale was designed to assess behavioral (ie, amount, depth of use) and experiential (ie, attention, interest, enjoyment) dimensions of engagement."
7358,1,"Participants (N=147) were UK-based, adult, excessive drinkers recruited via an online research platform. "
7359,1,Participants downloaded the Drink Less app and completed the scale immediately after their first login in exchange for a financial reward. 
7360,1,"Criterion variables included the objectively recorded amount of use, depth of use, and subsequent login. "
7361,1,"Five types of validity (ie, construct, criterion, predictive, incremental, divergent) were examined in exploratory factor, correlational, and regression analyses. "
7362,1,The Cronbach alpha was calculated to assess the scale's internal reliability. 
7363,1,Covariates included motivation to reduce alcohol consumption.
7364,2,Responses on the DBCI Engagement Scale could be characterized in terms of two largely independent subscales related to experience and behavior. 
7365,2,"The experiential and behavioral subscales showed high (alpha=.78) and moderate (alpha=.45) internal reliability, respectively. "
7366,2,"Total scale scores predicted future behavioral engagement (ie, subsequent login) with and without adjusting for users' motivation to reduce alcohol consumption (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=1.14; 95% CI 1.03-1.27; P=.01), which was driven by the experiential (ORadj=1.19; 95% CI 1.05-1.34; P=.006) but not the behavioral subscale."
7367,3,The DBCI Engagement Scale assesses behavioral and experiential aspects of engagement. 
7368,3,The behavioral subscale may not be a valid indicator of behavioral engagement. 
7369,3,The experiential subscale can predict subsequent behavioral engagement with an app for reducing alcohol consumption. 
7370,3,Further refinements and validation of the scale in larger samples and across different DBCIs are needed.
7371,4,Attracting Users to Online Health Communities: Analysis of LungCancer.nets Facebook Advertisement Campaign Data
7372,0,"With growing numbers of adults turning to the internet to get answers for health-related questions, online communities provide platforms with participatory networks to deliver health information and social support. "
7373,0,"However, to optimize the benefits of these online communities, these platforms must market effectively to attract new members and promote community growth."
7374,1,"In the fall of 2017, a series of 5 weeklong Facebook advertisement campaigns were launched targeting adults over the age of 18 years with an interest in lung cancer to increase opt ins to the LungCancer.net community (ie, the number of people who provided their email to join the site)."
7375,2,"The advertisements released during this campaign had a sum reach of 91,835 people, and 863 new members opted into the LungCancer.net community by providing their email address. "
7376,2,"Females aged 55 to 64 years were the largest population reached by the campaign (31,401/91,835; 34.29%), whereas females aged 65 and older were the largest population who opted into the LungCancer.net community (307/863; 35.57%). "
7377,2,"A total of US $1742 was invested in the Facebook campaigns, and 863 people opted into LungCancer.net , resulting in a cost of US $2.02 per new member."
7378,3,This research demonstrates the feasibility of using Facebook advertising to promote and grow online health communities. 
7379,3,More research is needed to compare the effectiveness of various advertising approaches. 
7380,3,Public health professionals should consider Facebook campaigns to effectively connect intended audiences to health information and support.
7381,4,"Utilization, Safety, and Technical Performance of a Telemedicine System for Prehospital Emergency Care: Observational Study"
7382,0,"As a consequence of increasing emergency medical service (EMS) missions requiring an EMS physician on site, we had implemented a unique prehospital telemedical emergency service as a new structural component to the conventional physician-based EMS in Germany."
7383,1,"We conducted a retrospective analysis of all primary emergency missions with telemedical consultation of an EMS physician in the City of Aachen (250,000 inhabitants) during the first 3 operational years of our tele-EMS system. "
7384,1,"Main outcome measures were the number of teleconsultations, number of complications, and number of transmission malfunctions during teleconsultations."
7385,2,The data of 6265 patients were analyzed. 
7386,2,The number of teleconsultations increased during the run-in period of four quarters toward full routine operation from 152 to 420 missions per quarter. 
7387,2,"When fully operational, around the clock, and providing teleconsultations to 11 mobile ambulances, the number of teleconsultations further increased by 25.9 per quarter (95% CI 9.1-42.6; P=.009). "
7388,2,"Only 6 of 6265 patients (0.10%; 95% CI 0.04%-0.21%) experienced adverse events, all of them not inherent in the system of teleconsultations. "
7389,2,Technical malfunctions of single transmission components occurred from as low as 0.3% (95% CI 0.2%-0.5%) during two-way voice communications to as high as 1.9% (95% CI 1.6%-2.3%) during real-time vital data transmissions. 
7390,2,Complete system failures occurred in only 0.3% (95% CI 0.2%-0.6%) of all teleconsultations.
7391,3,"The Aachen prehospital EMS is a frequently used, safe, and technically reliable system to provide medical care for emergency patients without an EMS physician physically present. "
7392,3,Noninferiority of the tele-EMS physician compared with an on-site EMS physician needs to be demonstrated in a randomized trial.
7393,4,Use of a Web-Based Dietary Assessment Tool (RiksmatenFlex) in Swedish Adolescents: Comparison and Validation Study
7394,0,A Web-based dietary assessment tool-RiksmatenFlex-was developed for the national dietary survey of adolescents in Sweden.
7395,1,"Adolescents aged 11-12, 14-15, and 17-18 years were recruited through schools. "
7396,1,"In total, 78 students had complete dietary information and were included in the study. "
7397,1,"Diet was reported a few weeks apart with either RiksmatenFlexDiet (the day before and a random later day) or recall interviews (face-to-face, a random day later by phone) in a cross-over, randomized design. "
7398,1,"At a school visit, weight and height were measured and blood samples were drawn for biomarker analyses. "
7399,1,Students wore an accelerometer for 7 days for physical activity measurements. 
7400,1,"Dietary intake captured by both dietary methods was compared, and energy intake captured by both methods was compared with the accelerometer-estimated energy expenditure (EEest). "
7401,1,"Intake of whole grain wheat and rye and fruit and vegetables by both methods was compared with alkylresorcinol and carotenoid concentrations in plasma, respectively."
7402,2,"The mean of the reported energy intake was 8.92 (SD 2.77) MJ by RiksmatenFlexDiet and 8.04 (SD 2.67) MJ by the recall interviews (P=.01) Intake of fruit and vegetables was 224 (169) g and 227 (150) g, and whole grain wheat and rye intake was 12.4 (SD 13.2) g and 12.0 (SD 13.1) g, respectively; the intakes of fruit and vegetables as well as whole grain wheat and iye did not differ between methods. "
7403,2,Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.57 for protein and carbohydrates to 0.23 for vegetables. 
7404,2,Energy intake by RiksmatenFlexDiet was overreported by 8% (P=.03) but not by the recall interviews (P=.53) compared with EEest. 
7405,2,The Spearman correlation coefficient between reported energy intake and EEest was 0.34 (P=.008) for RiksmatenFlexDiet and 0.16 (P=.21) for the recall interviews. 
7406,2,Spearman correlation coefficient between whole grain wheat and rye and plasma total alkylresorcinol homologs was 0.36 (P=.002) for RiksmatenFlexDiet and 0.29 (P=.02) for the recall interviews. 
7407,2,Spearman correlations between intake of fruit and vegetables and plasma carotenoids were weak for both dietary tools. 
7408,2,The strongest correlations were observed between fruit and vegetable intake and lutein/zeaxanthin for RiksmatenFlexDiet (0.46; P<.001) and for recall interviews (0.28; P=.02).
7409,3,"RiksmatenFlexDiet provides information on energy, fruit, vegetables, and whole grain wheat and rye intake, which is comparable with intake obtained from recall interviews in Swedish adolescents. "
7410,3,The results are promising for cost-effective dietary data collection in upcoming national dietary surveys and other studies in Sweden. 
7411,3,"Future research should focus on how, and if, new technological solutions could reduce dietary reporting biases."
7412,4,Diminishing Effects After Recurrent Use of Self-Guided Internet-Based Interventions in Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial
7413,0,Self-guided internet-based interventions have several advantages over guided interventions and are generally effective in treating psychiatric symptoms.
7414,1,A total of 125 individuals were randomized to the intervention condition (MOOD) and received access to the intervention for a period of six weeks or a CAU group. 
7415,1,"After six weeks, all participants were invited to take part in the post assessment. "
7416,1,The Beck Depression Inventory-II served as the primary outcome.
7417,2,Both intention-to-treat as well as per-protocol analyses indicated that the depressive symptomatology decreased in both conditions but showed no advantage for those who had used MOOD. 
7418,2,Subsequent moderation analyses suggested that those individuals who had less experience with psychotherapy benefitted to a greater extent compared with those with more experience.
7419,3,Self-guided internet-based interventions are deemed a suitable first-step approach to the treatment of depression. 
7420,3,"However, our results indicate that they are more efficacious in those with less psychotherapy experience."
7421,4,"Multimodal Human and Environmental Sensing for Longitudinal Behavioral Studies in Naturalistic Settings: Framework for Sensor Selection, Deployment, and Management"
7422,0,"Recent advances in mobile technologies for sensing human biosignals are empowering researchers to collect real-world data outside of the laboratory, in natural settings where participants can perform their daily activities with minimal disruption. "
7423,0,These new sensing opportunities usher a host of challenges and constraints for both researchers and participants.
7424,1,"This paper presents a collection of challenges, consideration criteria, and potential solutions for enabling researchers to select and manage appropriate sensors for their research studies. "
7425,1,"It explains a general data collection framework suitable for use with modern consumer sensors, enabling researchers to address many of the described challenges. "
7426,1,"In addition, it provides a description of the criteria affecting sensor selection, management, and integration that researchers should consider before beginning human behavior studies involving sensors. "
7427,1,"On the basis of a survey conducted in mid-2018, this paper further illustrates an organized snapshot of consumer-grade human sensing technologies that can be used for human behavior research in natural settings."
7428,2,The research team applied the collection of methods and criteria to a case study aimed at predicting the well-being of nurses and other staff in a hospital. 
7429,2,"Average daily compliance for sensor usage measured by the presence of data exceeding half the total possible hours each day was about 65%, yielding over 355,000 hours of usable sensor data across 212 participants. "
7430,2,"A total of 6 notable unexpected events occurred during the data collection period, all of which had minimal impact on the research project."
7431,3,"The satisfactory compliance rates and minimal impact of unexpected events during the case study suggest that the challenges, criteria, methods, and mitigation strategies presented as a guide for researchers are helpful for sensor selection and management in longitudinal human behavior studies in the wild."
7432,4,"Tailored, Therapist-Guided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Compared to Care as Usual for Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis: Economic Evaluation of a Randomized Controlled Trial"
7433,0,Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is an effective treatment for patients with a chronic somatic illness to improve self-management skills and to learn to adjust to their chronic disease and its impact on daily life. 
7434,0,"However, the implementation of iCBT in clinical practice is challenging."
7435,1,"A Web-based survey, based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was distributed among psychologists in a medical setting. "
7436,1,"The survey included questions regarding the current use of iCBT, intention to use iCBT in the future, and operationalized concepts of the UTAUT constructs, that is, performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), and facilitating conditions (FC)."
7437,2,"In total, 107 (24.8%) psychologists completed the survey. "
7438,2,"Of them, 16.8% have access to iCBT, 15.9% currently use iCBT, and 21.5% are expected to use iCBT within the next year. "
7439,2,"The constructs PE, EE, and SI together significantly influenced behavioral intention (BI; mean 3.9 [SD=0.8]) among nonusers (R-2=0.490; F-4.85=20.405; P<.001)."
7440,3,"In spite of an average to high BI, the current implementation of iCBT is rather low among psychologists in a medical setting. "
7441,3,Further research should focus on reducing the gap between intention to use and actual use by focusing on influencing the predictive UTAUT constructs.
7442,4,Implementation of a Web-Based Work-Related Psychological Aftercare Program Into Clinical Routine: Results of a Longitudinal Observational Study
7443,0,"As inpatient medical rehabilitation serves to promote work ability, vocational reintegration is a crucial outcome. "
7444,0,"However, previous Web-based trials on coping with work-related stress have been limited to Web-based recruitment of study participants."
7445,1,GSA-Online plus was prescribed by physicians at termination of orthopedic psychosomatic inpatient rehabilitation. 
7446,1,"Participants' use of the program, work-related attitudes, distress, and quality of life were assessed on the Web."
7447,2,"In 2 rehabilitation centers, 4.4% (112/2562) of rehabilitants got a recommendation for GSA-Online plus during inpatient rehabilitation. "
7448,2,"Compared with usual person aftercare, the Web-based aftercare program was rarely recommended by physicians. "
7449,2,"Recommendations were made more frequently in psychosomatic (69/1172, 5.9%) than orthopedic (43/1389, 3.1%) rehabilitation (chi(2)(1) =11.845, P=.001, Cramer V=-0.068) and to younger patients (P=.004, d=0.28) with longer inpatient treatment duration (P<.001, r=-0.12) and extended sick leaves before inpatient medical rehabilitation (P=.004; Cramer V=0.072). "
7450,2,"Following recommendation, 77% (86/112) of rehabilitants participated in Web-based aftercare. "
7451,2,"Completers (50/86, 58%) reported statistically significant improvements between discharge of inpatient treatment and the end of the aftercare program for subjective work ability (P=.02, d=0.41), perceived stress (P=.01, d=-0.38), functioning (P=.002, d=-0.60), and life satisfaction (P=.008, d=0.42)."
7452,3,Physicians' recommendations of Web-based aftercare are well accepted by patients who derive considerable benefits from participation. 
7453,3,"However, a low rate of prescription compared with other usual aftercare options points to barriers among physicians to prescribing Web-based aftercare."
7454,4,Valuing Citizen Access to Digital Health Services: Applied Value-Based Outcomes in the Canadian Context and Tools for Modernizing Health Systems
7455,0,"In publicly funded health systems, digital health technologies are strategies that aim to improve the quality and safety of health care service delivery and enhance patient experiences and outcomes. "
7456,0,"In Canada, governments and health organizations have invested in digital health technologies such as personal health records (PHRs) and other electronic service functionalities and innovation across provincial and territorial health systems."
7457,1,"We first synthesized results from a variety of Canadian and international studies on the outcomes for patients and service providers associated with PHRs across a continuum of services, ranging from viewing information (eg, laboratory results) on the Web to electronic prescription renewal to email or video conferencing with care teams and providers. "
7458,1,"We then developed a quantitative model of estimated value, grounded in these demonstrated benefits and citizen use (2016-2017). "
7459,1,"In addition to estimating the costs saved from patient and system perspectives, we used a novel application of a compensating differential approach to assess the value (independent of costs) to society of improved health and well-being resulting from PHR use."
7460,2,"Patients' access to a range of digital PHR functions generated value for Canadians and health systems by increasing health system productivity, and improving access to and quality of health care provided. "
7461,2,"As opportunities increased to interact and engage with health care providers via PHR functions, the marginal value generated by utilization of PHR functionalities also increased. "
7462,2,Web-based prescription renewal generated the largest share of the total current value from the patient perspective. 
7463,2,"From the health systems perspective, Canadians' ability to view their information on the Web was the largest value share. "
7464,2,"If PHRs were to be implemented with more integrated virtual care services, the value generated from populations with chronic illnesses such as severe and persistent mental illness and diabetes could amount to between Can $800 million and Can $1 billion per year across Canadian health systems."
7465,3,"PHRs with higher interactivity could yield substantial potential value from wider implementation in Canada and increased adoption rates in certain target groups-namely, high-frequency health system users and their caregivers. "
7466,3,"Further research is needed to tie PHR use to health outcomes across PHR functions, care settings, and patient populations."
7467,4,The Deep Learning-Based Recommender System Pubmender for Choosing a Biomedical Publication Venue: Development and Validation Study
7468,0,It is of great importance for researchers to publish research results in high-quality journals. 
7469,0,"However, it is often challenging to choose the most suitable publication venue, given the exponential growth of journals and conferences. "
7470,0,"Although recommender systems have achieved success in promoting movies, music, and products, very few studies have explored recommendation of publication venues, especially for biomedical research. "
7471,0,"No recommender system exists that can specifically recommend journals in PubMed, the largest collection of biomedical literature."
7472,1,"In Pubmender, pretrained word2vec was first used to construct the start-up feature space. "
7473,1,"Subsequently, a deep convolutional neural network was constructed to achieve a high-level representation of abstracts, and a fully connected softmax model was adopted to recommend the best journals."
7474,2,"We collected 880,165 papers from 1130 journals in PubMed Central and extracted abstracts from these papers as an empirical dataset. "
7475,2,"We compared different recommendation models such as Cavnar-Trenkle on the Microsoft Academic Search (MAS) engine, a collaborative filtering-based recommender system for the digital library of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and CiteSeer. "
7476,2,"We found the accuracy of our system for the top 10 recommendations to be 87.0%, 22.9%, and 196.0% higher than that of MAS, ACM, and CiteSeer, respectively. "
7477,2,"In addition, we compared our system with Journal Finder and Journal Suggester, which are tools of Elsevier and Springer, respectively, that help authors find suitable journals in their series. "
7478,2,The results revealed that the accuracy of our system was 329% higher than that of Journal Finder and 406% higher than that of Journal Suggester for the top 10 recommendations. 
7479,2,Our web service is freely available at https://www.keaml.cn:8081/.
7480,3,Our deep learning-based recommender system can suggest an appropriate journal list to help biomedical scientists and clinicians choose suitable venues for their papers.
7481,4,Secure and Scalable mHealth Data Management Using Blockchain Combined With Client Hashchain: System Design and Validation
7482,0,"Blockchain is emerging as an innovative technology for secure data management in many areas, including medical practice. "
7483,0,"A distributed blockchain network is tolerant against network fault, and the registered data are resistant to tampering and revision. "
7484,0,The technology has a high affinity with digital medicine like mobile health (mHealth) and provides reliability to the medical data without labor-intensive third-party contributions. 
7485,0,"On the other hand, the reliability of the medical data is not insured before registration to the blockchain network. "
7486,0,"Furthermore, there are issues with regard to how the clients' mobile devices should be dealt with and authenticated in the blockchain network in order to avoid impersonation."
7487,1,We designed an mHealth system that sends medical data to the blockchain network via relay servers. 
7488,1,The architecture provides scalability and convenience of operation of the system. 
7489,1,"In order to ensure the reliability of the data from clients' mobile devices, hash values with chain structure (client hashchain) were calculated in the clients' devices and the results were registered on the blockchain network."
7490,2,The system was applied and deployed in mHealth for insomnia treatment. 
7491,2,Clinical trials for mHealth were conducted with insomnia patients. 
7492,2,Medical data of the recruited patients were successfully registered with the blockchain network via relay servers along with the hashchain calculated on the clients' mobile devices. 
7493,2,"The correctness of the data was validated by identifying illegal data, which were made by simulating fraudulent access."
7494,3,"Our proposed mHealth system, blockchain combined with client hashchain, ensures compatibility of security and scalability in the data management of mHealth medical practice."
7495,4,eHealth Literacy: Extending the Digital Divide to the Realm of Health Information
7496,0,"Internet use for health information is important, given the rise of electronic health (eHealth) that integrates technology into health care. "
7497,0,"Despite the perceived widespread use of the internet, a persistent ""digital divide"" exists in which many individuals have ready access to the internet and others do not. "
7498,0,"To date, most published reports have compared characteristics of internet users seeking health information vs nonusers. "
7499,0,"However, there is little understanding of the differences between internet users seeking health information online and users who do not seek such information online. "
7500,0,Understanding these differences could enable targeted outreach for health interventions and promotion of eHealth technologies.
7501,1,The 2015-2016 California Health Interview Survey datasets were used for this study. 
7502,1,"Internet use was classified as never used the internet (Never use), ever used the internet but not to search for health information in the last 12 months (Use not for health), and ever used the internet and have used it to search for health information in the last 12 months (Use for health). "
7503,1,Weighted multinomial logistic regression was used to assess sociodemographic and health characteristics associated with types of internet use. 
7504,1,Findings are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs.
7505,2,"Among 42,087 participants (weighted sample of 29,236,426), 19% reported Never Use of the internet, 27.9% reported Use not for health, and 53.1% reported Use for health. "
7506,2,"Compared to Never Use individuals, Use for health individuals were more likely to be younger (OR: 0.1, 95% CI 0.1-0.2 for >= 60 years vs <60 years), female (OR: 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-1.9 compared to males), and non-Hispanic white (OR: 0.54, 95% CI 0.4-0.7 for Latinos and OR: 0.2, 95% CI 0.2-0.4 for African Americans) and have a higher socioeconomic status (>400% of Federal Poverty Guidelines; OR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.4-2.4). "
7507,2,"Overall, characteristics for the Use not for health and Use for health groups were similar, except for those with lower levels of education and respondents not having visited a physician in the last year. "
7508,2,"For these two characteristics, the Use not for health group was more similar to the Never Use group."
7509,3,Our findings indicate that a digital divide characterized by sociodemographic and health information exists across three types of users. 
7510,3,"Our results are in line with those of previous studies on the divide, specifically with regard to disparities in use and access related to age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. "
7511,3,Disparities in online health-seeking behavior may reflect existing disparities in health care access extending into a new era of health technology. 
7512,3,These findings support the need for interventions to target internet access and health literacy among Never Use and Use not for health groups.
7513,4,OpenNotes After 7 Years: Patient Experiences With Ongoing Access to Their Clinicians Outpatient Visit Notes
7514,0,"Following a 2010-2011 pilot intervention in which a limited sample of primary care doctors offered their patients secure Web-based portal access to their office visit notes, the participating sites expanded OpenNotes to nearly all clinicians in primary care, medical, and surgical specialty practices."
7515,1,"A total of 3 large US health systems in Boston, Seattle, and rural Pennsylvania conducted a Web-based survey of adult patients who used portal accounts and had at least 1 visit note available in a recent 12-month period. "
7516,1,The main outcome measures included patient-reported behaviors and their perceptions concerning benefits versus risks.
7517,2,"Among 136,815 patients who received invitations, 21.68% (29,656/136,815) responded. "
7518,2,"Of the 28,782 patient respondents, 62.82% (18,081/28,782) were female, 72.90% (20,982/28,782) were aged 45 years or older, 76.94% (22,146/28,782) were white, and 14.30% (4115/28,782) reported fair or poor health. "
7519,2,"Among the 22,947 who reported reading 1 or more notes, 3 out of 4 reported reading them for 1 year or longer, half reported reading at least 4 notes, and 37.74% (8588/22,753) shared a note with someone else. "
7520,2,"Patients rated note reading as very important for helping take care of their health (16,354/22,520, 72.62%), feeling in control of their care (15,726/22,515, 69.85%), and remembering the plan of care (14,821/22,516, 65.82%). "
7521,2,"Few were very confused (737/22,304, 3.3%) or more worried (1078/22,303, 4.83%) after reading notes. "
7522,2,About a third reported being encouraged by their clinicians to read notes and a third told their clinicians they had read them. 
7523,2,"Less educated, nonwhite, older, and Hispanic patients, and individuals who usually did not speak English at home, were those most likely to report major benefits from note reading. "
7524,2,"Nearly all respondents (22,593/22,947, 98.46%) thought Web-based access to visit notes a good idea, and 62.38% (13,427/21,525) rated this practice as very important for choosing a future provider."
7525,3,"In this first large-scale survey of patient experiences with a broad range of clinicians working in practices in which shared notes are well established, patients find note reading very important for their health management and share their notes frequently with others. "
7526,3,"Patients are rarely troubled by what they read, and those traditionally underserved in the United States report particular benefit. "
7527,3,"However, fewer than half of clinicians and patients actively address their shared notes during visits. "
7528,3,"As the practice continues to spread rapidly in the United States and internationally, our findings indicate that OpenNotes brings benefits to patients that largely outweigh the risks."
7529,4,Efficacy of a Web-Based Self-Management Enhancing Program for Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: Explorative Randomized Controlled Trial
7530,0,"Web-based self-management enhancing programs have the potential to support patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in their self-management; for example, improve their health status by increasing their self-efficacy or taking their prescribed medication. "
7531,0,We developed a Web-based self-management enhancing program in collaboration with RA patients and professionals as co-designers on the basis of the intervention mapping framework. 
7532,0,"Although self-management programs are complex interventions, it is informative to perform an explorative randomized controlled trial (RCT) before embarking on a larger trial."
7533,1,A multicenter exploratory RCT was performed with an intervention group and a control group. 
7534,1,Both groups received care as usual. 
7535,1,"In addition, the intervention group received 12 months of access to a Web-based self-management program. "
7536,1,"Assessment occurred at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. "
7537,1,"Outcome measures included self-management behavior (Patient Activation Measurement, Self-Management Ability Scale), self-efficacy (Rheumatoid Arthritis task-specific Self-Efficacy, Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interaction), general health status (RAND-36), focus on fatigue (Modified Pain Coping Inventory for Fatigue), and perceived pain and fatigue (Numeric Rating Scales). "
7538,1,"A linear mixed model for repeated measures, using the intention-to-treat principle, was applied to study differences between the patients in the intervention (n=78) and control (n=79) groups. "
7539,1,A sensitivity analysis was performed in the intervention group to study the influence of patients with high (N=30) and low (N=40) use of the intervention.
7540,2,No positive effects were found regarding the outcome measurements. 
7541,2,Effect sizes were low.
7542,3,"Based on these results, it is not possible to conclude on the positive effects of the intervention or to select outcome measures to be regarded as the primary/main or secondary outcomes for a future trial. "
7543,3,A process evaluation should be performed to provide more insight into the low compliance with and effectiveness of the intervention. 
7544,3,This can determine for whom this sort of program will work and help to fine-tune the inclusion criteria.
7545,4,Effectiveness of Internet-Delivered Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Patients With Insomnia Who Remain Symptomatic Following Pharmacotherapy: Randomized Controlled Exploratory Trial
7546,0,"In reality, pharmacotherapy still remains the most common treatment for insomnia."
7547,1,"We recruited 23 patients with insomnia who remained symptomatic following pharmacologic treatment including benzodiazepines, and we conducted an exploratory randomized controlled trial. "
7548,1,The primary outcome was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at week 6 of the treatment. 
7549,1,"Secondary outcomes were sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, refreshment and soundness of sleep, anxiety by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, depression measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and quality of life (QOL) measured by the EuroQol-5D. "
7550,1,"All parameters were measured at weeks 0 (baseline), 6 (postintervention), and 12 (follow-up)."
7551,2,The adjusted mean reduction (-6.11) in PSQI at week 6 from baseline in the ICBT plus UC group was significantly (P<.001) larger than the adjusted mean reduction (0.40) in the UC alone group. 
7552,2,"Significant differences were also found in favor of ICBT plus UC for PSQI, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, and depression at all assessment points. "
7553,2,"Refreshment, soundness of sleep, anxiety, and QOL improved by week 6 in ICBT plus UC compared with UC alone. "
7554,2,There were no reports of adverse events in either group during the study.
7555,3,These results indicated that our 6-week ICBT program is an effective treatment adjunct to UC for improving insomnia and related symptoms even after unsuccessful pharmacotherapy.
7556,4,Crowdsourcing for Food Purchase Receipt Annotation via Amazon Mechanical Turk: A Feasibility Study
7557,0,The decisions that individuals make about the food and beverage products they purchase and consume directly influence their energy intake and dietary quality and may lead to excess weight gain and obesity. 
7558,0,"However, gathering and interpreting data on food and beverage purchase patterns can be difficult. "
7559,0,Leveraging novel sources of data on food and beverage purchase behavior can provide us with a more objective understanding of food consumption behaviors.
7560,1,"Between 2013 and 2014, receipts (N=12,165) from consumer purchases were collected at 60 different locations of five fast-food restaurant chains in New Jersey and New York City, USA (ie, Burger King, KFC, McDonald's, Subway, and Wendy's). "
7561,1,"Data containing the restaurant name, location, receipt ID, food items purchased, price, and other information were manually entered into an MS Access database and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer; this was considered the gold standard. "
7562,1,"To assess the feasibility of coding receipt data via MTurk, a prototype set of receipts (N=196) was selected. "
7563,1,"For each receipt, 5 turkers were asked to (1) identify the receipt identifier and the name of the restaurant and (2) indicate whether a beverage was listed in the receipt; if yes, they were to categorize the beverage as cold (eg, soda or energy drink) or hot (eg, coffee or tea). "
7564,1,"Interturker agreement for specific questions (eg, restaurant name and beverage inclusion) and agreement between turker consensus responses and the gold standard values in the manually entered dataset were calculated."
7565,2,"Among the 196 receipts completed by turkers, the interturker agreement was 100% (196/196) for restaurant names (eg, Burger King, McDonald's, and Subway), 98.5% (193/196) for beverage inclusion (ie, hot, cold, or none), 92.3% (181/196) for types of hot beverage (eg, hot coffee or hot tea), and 87.2% (171/196) for types of cold beverage (eg, Coke or bottled water). "
7566,2,"When compared with the gold standard data, the agreement level was 100% (196/196) for restaurant name, 99.5% (195/196) for beverage inclusion, and 99.5% (195/196) for beverage types."
7567,3,"Our findings indicated high interrater agreement for questions across difficulty levels (eg, single-vs binary-vs multiple-choice items). "
7568,3,"Compared with traditional methods for coding receipt data, MTurk can produce excellent-quality data in a lower-cost, more time-efficient manner."
7569,4,Designing Robust N-of-1 Studies for Precision Medicine
7570,0,"Recent advances in molecular biology, sensors, and digital medicine have led to an explosion of products and services for high-resolution monitoring of individual health. "
7571,0,"The N-of-1 study has emerged as an important methodological tool for harnessing these new data sources, enabling researchers to compare the effectiveness of health interventions at the level of a single individual."
7572,1,"Our stochastic time-series model simulates an N-of-1 study, incorporating all study-relevant effects, such as carryover and wash-in effects, as well as various sources of noise. "
7573,1,"The model can be used to produce realistic simulated data for a near-infinite number of N-of-1 study designs, treatment profiles, and patient characteristics."
7574,2,"Using simulation, we demonstrate how the number of treatment blocks, ordering of treatments within blocks, duration of each treatment, and sampling frequency affect our ability to detect true differences in treatment efficacy. "
7575,2,"We provide a set of recommendations for study designs on the basis of treatment, outcomes, and instrument parameters, and make our simulation software publicly available for use by the precision medicine community."
7576,3,Simulation can facilitate rapid optimization of N-of-1 study designs and increase the likelihood of study success while minimizing participant burden.
7577,4,Detecting the Interdisciplinary Nature and Topic Hotspots of Robotics in Surgery: Social Network Analysis and Bibliometric Study
7578,0,"With the widespread application of a robot to surgery, growing literature related to robotics in surgery (RS) documents widespread concerns from scientific researchers worldwide. "
7579,0,"Although such application is helpful to considerably improve the accuracy of surgery, we still lack the understanding of the multidiscipline-crossing status and topic distribution related to RS."
7580,1,"The authors collected publications related to RS in the last 21 years, indexed by the Web of Science Core Collection. "
7581,1,"Various bibliometric methods and tools were used, including literature distribution analysis at the country and institution level and interdisciplinary collaboration analysis in the different periods of time. "
7582,1,Co-word analysis was performed based on the keywords with high frequency. 
7583,1,The temporal visualization bar presented the evolution of topics over time.
7584,2,A total of 7732 bibliographic records related to RS were identified. 
7585,2,"The United States plays a leading role in the publication output related to RS, followed by Italy and Germany. "
7586,2,It should be noted that the Yonsei University in South Korea published the highest number of RS-related publications. 
7587,2,"Furthermore, the interdisciplinary collaboration is uneven; the number of disciplines involved in each paper dropped from the initial 1.60 to the current 1.31. "
7588,2,"Surgery; Engineering; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, and Medical Imaging; and Neurosciences and Neurology are the 4 core disciplines in the field of RS, all of which have extensive cooperation with other disciplines. "
7589,2,"The distribution of topic hotspots is in imbalanced status, which can be categorized into 7 clusters. "
7590,2,"Moreover, 3 areas about the evolution of topic were identified, namely (1) the exploration of techniques that make RS implemented, (2) rapid development of robotic systems and related applications in surgery, and (3) application of a robot to excision of tissues or organs targeted at various specific diseases."
7591,3,"This study provided important insights into the interdisciplinary nature related to RS, which indicates that the researchers with different disciplinary backgrounds should strengthen cooperation to publish a high-quality output. "
7592,3,"The research topic hotspots related to RS are relatively scattered, which has begun to turn to the application of RS targeted at specific diseases. "
7593,3,Our study is helpful to provide a potential guide to the direction of the field of RS for future research in the field of RS.
7594,4,The Effect of Online Effort and Reputation of Physicians on Patients Choice: 3-Wave Data Analysis of Chinas Good Doctor Website
7595,0,"Nowadays, patients are seeking physician information more frequently via the internet. "
7596,0,Physician-rating websites (PRWs) have been recognized as the most convenient way to gain insight and detailed information about specific physicians before receiving consultation. 
7597,0,"However, little is known about how the information provided on PRWs may affect patients' decisions to seek medical advice."
7598,1,"A model, based on social exchange theory, was developed to analyze the factors associated with the number of online patients. "
7599,1,"A 3-wave data collection exercise, covering 4037 physicians on China's Good Doctor website, was conducted during the months of February, April, and June 2017. "
7600,1,"Increases in consultation in a 60-day period were used as the dependent variable, whereas 2 series of data were analyzed using linear regression modeling. "
7601,1,The fixed-effect model was used to analyze the 3-wave data.
7602,2,"The adjusted R-2 value in the linear regression models were 0.28 and 0.27, whereas in the fixed-effect model, it was .30. "
7603,2,Both the linear regression and fixed-effect models yielded a good fit. 
7604,2,A positive effect of physicians' effort on the aggregated number of online patients was identified in all models (R-2=0.30 and R-2=0.37 in 2 regression models; R-2=0.23 in fixed effect model; P<.001). 
7605,2,"The proxies of physicians' reputations indicated different results, with total number of page views of physicians' homepages (R-2=0.43 and R-2=0.46; R-2=0.16; P<.001) and number of votes received (R-2=0.33 and R-2=0.27; R-2=0.43; P<.001) being seen as positive. "
7606,2,"Virtual gifts were not significant in all models, whereas thank-you messages were only significant in the fixed-effect model (R-2=0.11; P=.02). "
7607,2,"The effort made by physicians online is positively associated with their aggregated number of patients consulted, whereas the effect of a physician's reputation remains uncertain. "
7608,2,The control effect of a physician's title and hospital's level was not significant in all linear regressions.
7609,3,"Both the effort and reputation of physicians online contribute to the increased number of online patients' consultation; however, the influence of a physician's reputation varies. "
7610,3,This may imply that physicians' online effort and reputation are critical in attracting patients and that strategic manipulation of physician profiles is worthy of study. 
7611,3,Practical insights are also discussed.
7612,4,Elements of Trust in Digital Health Systems: Scoping Review
7613,0,Information and communication technologies have long become prominent components of health systems. 
7614,0,"Rapid advances in digital technologies and data science over the last few years are predicted to have a vast impact on health care services, configuring a paradigm shift into what is now commonly referred to as digital health. "
7615,0,"Forecasted to curb rising health costs as well as to improve health system efficiency and safety, digital health success heavily relies on trust from professional end users, administrators, and patients. "
7616,0,"Yet, what counts as the building blocks of trust in digital health systems has so far remained underexplored."
7617,1,We performed a scoping review to map out trust in digital health. 
7618,1,"To identify relevant digital health studies, we searched 5 electronic databases. "
7619,1,"Using keywords and Medical Subject Headings, we targeted all relevant studies and set no boundaries for publication year to allow a broad range of studies to be identified. "
7620,1,The studies were screened by 2 reviewers after which a predefined data extraction strategy was employed and relevant themes documented.
7621,2,"Overall, 278 qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, and intervention studies in English, published between 1998 and 2017 and conducted in 40 countries were included in this review. "
7622,2,Patients and health care professionals were the two most prominent stakeholders of trust in digital health; a third-health administrators-was substantially less prominent. 
7623,2,"Our analysis identified cross-cutting personal, institutional, and technological elements of trust that broadly cluster into 16 enablers (altruism, fair data access, ease of use, self-efficacy, sociodemographic factors, recommendation by other users, usefulness, customizable design features, interoperability, privacy, initial face-to-face contact, guidelines for standardized use, stakeholder engagement, improved communication, decreased workloads, and service provider reputation) and 10 impediments (excessive costs, limited accessibility, sociodemographic factors, fear of data exploitation, insufficient training, defective technology, poor information quality, inadequate publicity, time-consuming, and service provider reputation) to trust in digital health."
7624,3,Trust in digital health technologies and services depends on the interplay of a complex set of enablers and impediments. 
7625,3,This study is a contribution to ongoing efforts to understand what determines trust in digital health according to different stakeholders. 
7626,3,"Therefore, it offers valuable points of reference for the implementation of innovative digital health services. "
7627,3,"Building on insights from this study, actionable metrics can be developed to assess the trustworthiness of digital technologies in health care."
7628,4,Clinical Feasibility of a Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention App (iREST) as a Behavioral Sleep Treatment in a Military Population: Feasibility Comparative Effectiveness Study
7629,0,"Although evidence-based cognitive behavioral sleep treatments have been shown to be safe and effective, these treatments have limited scalability. "
7630,0,Mobile health tools can address this scalability challenge. 
7631,0,"iREST, or interactive Resilience Enhancing Sleep Tactics, is a mobile health platform designed to provide a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) in the assessment, monitoring, and delivery of evidence-based sleep recommendations in a scalable and personalized manner. "
7632,0,The platform includes a mobile phone-based patient app linked to a clinician portal.
7633,1,"In this pilot study, military service members and veterans between the ages of 18 and 60 years who reported clinically significant service-related sleep disturbances were enrolled as participants. "
7634,1,Participants were asked to use iREST for a period of 4 to 6 weeks during which time they completed a daily sleep/wake diary. 
7635,1,"Through the clinician portal, trained clinicians offered recommendations consistent with evidence-based behavioral sleep treatments on weeks 2 through 4. "
7636,1,"To explore potential effectiveness, self-report measures were used, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the PSQI Addendum for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder."
7637,0,"In resource-constrained settings, challenges with unique patient identification may limit continuity of care, monitoring and evaluation, and data integrity. "
7638,0,Biometrics offers an appealing but understudied potential solution.
7639,1,Digital fingerprinting was performed using multispectral fingerprint scanners. 
7640,1,"We tested associations between demographic, clinical, and temporal characteristics and failure to capture a digital fingerprint. "
7641,1,We used generalized estimating equations and a robust covariance estimator to account for clustering. 
7642,1,"In addition, we evaluated the clustering of outcomes by household and community health workers (CHWs) by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). "
7643,1,"To understand the determinants of intended and actual use of fingerprinting technology, we conducted 15 in-depth interviews with CHWs and applied a widely used conceptual framework, the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2)."
7644,2,"Digital fingerprints were captured for 75.5% (694/919) of participants, with extensive clustering by household (ICC=.99) arising from software (108/179, 60.3%) and hardware (65/179, 36.3%) failures. "
7645,2,Clinical and demographic characteristics were not markedly associated with fingerprint capture. 
7646,2,"CHWs successfully fingerprinted all contacts in 70.1% (213/304) of households, with modest clustering of outcomes by CHWs (ICC=.18). "
7647,2,"The proportion of households in which all members were successfully fingerprinted declined over time (rho=.30, P<.001). "
7648,2,"In interviews, CHWs reported that fingerprinting failures lowered their perceptions of the quality of the technology, threatened their social image as competent health workers, and made the technology more difficult to use."
7649,3,"We found that digital fingerprinting was feasible and acceptable for individual identification, but problems implementing the hardware and software lead to a high failure rate. "
7650,3,"Although CHWs found fingerprinting to be acceptable in principle, their intention to use the technology was tempered by perceptions that it was inconsistent and of questionable value. "
7651,3,TAM2 provided a valuable framework for understanding the motivations behind CHWs' intentions to use the technology. 
7652,3,We emphasize the need for routine process evaluation of biometrics and other digital technologies in resource-constrained settings to assess implementation effectiveness and guide improvement of delivery.
7653,4,"Assessing the Methods, Tools, and Statistical Approaches in Google Trends Research: Systematic Review"
7654,0,"In the era of information overload, are big data analytics the answer to access and better manage available knowledge? "
7655,0,"Over the last decade, the use of Web-based data in public health issues, that is, infodemiology, has been proven useful in assessing various aspects of human behavior. "
7656,0,"Google Trends is the most popular tool to gather such information, and it has been used in several topics up to this point, with health and medicine being the most focused subject. "
7657,0,"Web-based behavior is monitored and analyzed in order to examine actual human behavior so as to predict, better assess, and even prevent health-related issues that constantly arise in everyday life."
7658,1,"Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for selecting studies, we searched for the term ""Google Trends"" in the Scopus and PubMed databases from 2006 to 2016, applying specific criteria for types of publications and topics. "
7659,1,"A total of 109 published papers were extracted, excluding duplicates and those that did not fall inside the topics of health and medicine or the selected article types. "
7660,1,"We then further categorized the published papers according to their methodological approach, namely, visualization, seasonality, correlations, forecasting, and modeling."
7661,2,"All the examined papers comprised, by definition, time series analysis, and all but two included data visualization. "
7662,2,"A total of 23.1% (24/104) studies used Google Trends data for examining seasonality, while 39.4% (41/104) and 32.7% (34/104) of the studies used correlations and modeling, respectively. "
7663,2,"Only 8.7% (9/104) of the studies used Google Trends data for predictions and forecasting in health-related topics; therefore, it is evident that a gap exists in forecasting using Google Trends data."
7664,3,"The monitoring of online queries can provide insight into human behavior, as this field is significantly and continuously growing and will be proven more than valuable in the future for assessing behavioral changes and providing ground for research using data that could not have been accessed otherwise."
7665,4,Mobile App Use by Primary Care Patients to Manage Their Depressive Symptoms: Qualitative Study
7666,0,Mobile apps are emerging as tools with the potential to revolutionize the treatment of mental health conditions such as depression. 
7667,0,"At the forefront of the community health sector, general practitioners are in a unique position to guide the integration of technology and depression management; however, little is currently known about how primary care patients with depressive symptoms are currently using apps."
7668,1,"Semistructured phone interviews were conducted with primary care patients in Victoria, Australia, who reported symptoms of depression and were enrolled in a larger randomized controlled trial of depression care. "
7669,1,Interviews explored current depression management strategies and the use of mobile apps (if any). 
7670,1,Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. 
7671,1,Inductive thematic analysis was iteratively conducted using QSR NVivo 11 Pro to identify emergent themes.
7672,2,"A total of 16 participants, aged between 20 to 58 years, took part in the interviews with 11 reporting the use of at least one mobile app to manage depressive symptoms and 5 reporting no app use. "
7673,2,"A variety of apps were described including relaxation, mindfulness, cognitive, exercise, gaming, social media, and well-being apps to aid with depressive symptoms. "
7674,2,"Among users, there were the following 4 main patterns of app use: skill acquisition, social connectedness, inquisitive trial, and safety netting. "
7675,2,"Factors that influenced app use included accessibility, perceptions of technology, and personal compatibility. "
7676,2,Health care providers also had a role in initiating app use.
7677,3,Mobile apps are being utilized for self-management of depressive symptoms by primary care patients. 
7678,3,"This study provided insight into the natural patterns and perspectives of app use, which enhanced the understanding of how this technology may be integrated into the toolbox for the management of depression."
7679,4,Unsupervised Machine Learning to Identify High Likelihood of Dementia in Population-Based Surveys: Development and Validation Study
7680,0,"Dementia is increasing in prevalence worldwide, yet frequently remains undiagnosed, especially in low-and middle-income countries. "
7681,0,Population-based surveys represent an underinvestigated source to identify individuals at risk of dementia.
7682,1,"Unsupervised machine learning classification (hierarchical clustering on principal components) was developed in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; 2002-2003, N=18,165 individuals) and validated in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE; 2010-2012, N=58,202 individuals)."
7683,2,"Unsupervised machine learning classification identified three clusters in HRS: cluster 1 (n=12,231) without any functional or motor limitations, cluster 2 (N=4841) with walking/climbing limitations, and cluster 3 (N=1093) with both functional and walking/climbing limitations. "
7684,2,Comparison of cluster 3 with previously published predicted probabilities of dementia in HRS showed that it identified high likelihood of dementia (probability of dementia >0.95; area under the curve [AUC]=0.91). 
7685,2,"Removing either cognitive or both cognitive and behavioral measures did not impede accurate classification (AUC=0.91 and AUC=0.90, respectively). "
7686,2,"Three clusters with similar profiles were identified in SHARE (cluster 1: n=40,223; cluster 2: n=15,644; cluster 3: n=2335). "
7687,2,Survival rate of participants from cluster 3 reached 39.2% (n=665 deceased) in HRS and 62.2% (n=811 deceased) in SHARE after a 3.9-year follow-up. 
7688,2,Surviving participants from cluster 3 in both cohorts worsened their functional and mobility performance over the same period.
7689,3,"Unsupervised machine learning identifies high likelihood of dementia in population-based surveys, even without cognitive and behavioral measures and without the need of clinical diagnosis of dementia in a subsample of the population. "
7690,3,This method could be used to tackle the global challenge of dementia.
7691,4,Validation of a Novel Electronic Health Record Patient Portal Advance Care Planning Delivery System
7692,0,Advance care planning allows patients to articulate their future care preferences should they no longer be able to make decisions on their own. 
7693,0,"Early advance care planning in outpatient settings provides benefits such as less aggressive care and fewer hospitalizations, yet it is underutilized due to barriers such as provider time constraints and communication complexity. "
7694,0,"Novel methods, such as patient portals, provide a unique opportunity to conduct advance care planning previsit planning for outpatient care. "
7695,0,This follow-up to our pilot study aimed to conduct pragmatic testing of a novel electronic health record-tethered framework and its effects on advance care planning delivery in a real-world primary care setting.
7696,1,"We conducted a pragmatic trial including 2 sister clinical sites, one site implementing the intervention and the other continuing standard care. "
7697,1,A total of 419 patients aged between 50 and 93 years with active portal accounts received intervention (n=200) or standard care (n=219). 
7698,1,Chart review analyzed the presence of advance care planning and its quality and was graded with previously established scoring criteria based on advance care planning best practice guidelines from multiple nations.
7699,2,A total of 19.5% (39/200) of patients who received previsit planning responded to the framework. 
7700,2,We found that the intervention site had statistically significant improvement in new advance care planning documentation rates (P<.01) and quality (P<.01) among all eligible patients. 
7701,2,Advance care planning documentation rates increased by 105% (19/39 to 39/39) and quality improved among all patients who engaged in the previsit planning framework (n=39). 
7702,2,"Among eligible patients aged between 50 and 60 years at the intervention site, advance care planning documentation rates increased by 37% (27/96 to 37/96). "
7703,2,Advance care planning documentation rates increased 34% among high users (27/67 to 36/67).
7704,3,"Advance care planning previsit planning using a secure electronic health record-supported patient portal framework yielded improvement in the presence of advance care planning documentation, with highest improvement in active patient portal users and patients aged between 50 and 60 years. "
7705,3,Targeted previsit patient portal advance care planning delivery in these populations can potentially improve the quality of care in these populations.
7706,4,Web-Based Intervention for Family Carers of Persons with Dementia and Multiple Chronic Conditions (My Tools 4 Care): Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial
7707,0,My Tools 4 Care (MT4C) is a Web-based intervention that was developed based on the transitions theory. 
7708,0,"It is an interactive, self-administered, and portable toolkit containing six main sections intended to support carers of community-living persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia and multiple chronic conditions through their transition experiences."
7709,1,"A multisite, pragmatic, mixed methods, longitudinal, repeated-measures, randomized controlled trial was conducted between June 2015 and April 2017. "
7710,1,Eligible participants were randomized into either treatment (MT4C) or educational control groups. 
7711,1,"Following baseline measures, carers in the treatment group received 3 months of password-protected access to MT4C. "
7712,1,"Trained research assistants collected data from participants via phone on hope (Herth Hope Index [HHI]), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale), and health-related quality of life (Short Form-12 item [version 2] health survey; SF-12v2) at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. "
7713,1,"The use and cost of health and social services (Health and Social Services Utilization Inventory) among participants were measured at baseline, 3, and 6 months. "
7714,1,"Analysis of covariance was used to identify group differences at 3 months, and generalized estimating equations were used to identify group differences over time."
7715,2,"A total of 199 carers participated in this study, with 101 participants in the treatment group and 98 in the educational control group. "
7716,2,"Of all, 23% (45/199) participants withdrew during the study for various reasons, including institutionalization or death of the person with dementia and lack of time from the carer. "
7717,2,"In the treatment group, 73% (74/101) carers used MT4C at least once over the 3-month period. "
7718,2,"No significant differences in the primary outcome measure (mental component summary score from the SF-12v2) by group or time were noted at 3 months; however, significant differences were evident for HHI-factor 2 (P=.01), with higher hope scores in the treatment group than in the control group. "
7719,2,General estimating equations showed no statistically significant group differences in terms of mental component summary score at all time points. 
7720,2,Attrition and the fact that not all carers in the treatment group used MT4C may explain the absence of statistically significant results for the main outcome variable.
7721,3,"Despite no significant differences between groups in terms of the primary outcome variable (mental component score), the significant differences in terms of one of the hope factors suggest that MT4C had a positive influence on the lives of participants."
7722,4,Recruiting Hard-to-Reach Populations for Survey Research: Using Facebook and Instagram Advertisements and In-Person Intercept in LGBT Bars and Nightclubs to Recruit LGBT Young Adults
7723,0,"Tobacco public education campaigns focus increasingly on hard-to-reach populations at higher risk for smoking, prompting campaign creators and evaluators to develop strategies to reach hard-to-reach populations in virtual and physical spaces where they spend time."
7724,1,"We recruited LGBT adults aged 18-24 years in the United States via Facebook and Instagram ads (N=1709, mean age 20.94, SD 1.94) or intercept in LGBT social venues (N=2348, mean age 21.98, SD 1.69) for the baseline evaluation survey. "
7725,1,"Covariates related to recruitment strategy were age; race or ethnicity; LGBT identity; education; pride event attendance; and alcohol, cigarette, and social media use."
7726,2,"Lesbian or gay women (adjusted odds ratio, AOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.54-2.29, P<.001), bisexual men and women (AOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17-1.82, P=.001), gender minorities (AOR 1.68, 95% CI 1.26-2.25, P<.001), and other sexual minorities (AOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.62-3.80, P<.001) were more likely than gay men to be recruited via social media (than intercept). "
7727,2,"Hispanic (AOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.89, P=.001) and other or multiracial, non-Hispanic participants (AOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.90, P=.006) were less likely than white, non-Hispanic participants to be recruited via social media. "
7728,2,"As age increased, odds of recruitment via social media decreased (AOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.72-0.80, P<.001). "
7729,2,"Participants with some college education (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03-1.56, P=.03) were more likely than those with a college degree to be recruited via social media. "
7730,2,"Participants reporting past 30-day alcohol use were less likely to be recruited via social media (AOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.24-0.44, P<.001). "
7731,2,"Participants who reported past-year pride event attendance were more likely to be recruited via social media (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06-1.64, P=.02), as well as those who used Facebook at least once daily (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14-1.80, P=.002). "
7732,2,"Participants who reported using Instagram at least once daily were less likely to be recruited via social media (AOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.86, P<.001). "
7733,2,"Social media recruitment was faster (incidence rate ratio, IRR=3.31, 95% CI 3.11-3.52, P<.001) and less expensive (2.2% of combined social media and intercept recruitment cost) but had greater data quality issues-a larger percentage of social media respondents were lost because of duplicate and low-quality responses (374/4446, 8.41%) compared with intercept respondents lost to interviewer misrepresentation (15/4446, 0.34%; P<.001)."
7734,3,"Social media combined with intercept provided access to important LGBT subpopulations (eg, gender and other sexual minorities) and a more diverse sample. "
7735,3,Social media methods have more data quality issues but are faster and less expensive than intercept. 
7736,3,"Recruiting hard-to-reach populations via audience-tailored strategies enabled recruitment of one of the largest LGBT young adult samples, suggesting these methods' promise for accessing hard-to-reach populations."
7737,4,Online Lifestyle Modification Intervention: Survey of Primary Care Providers Attitudes and Views
7738,0,Online tools are a convenient and effective method of delivering lifestyle interventions to obese adult primary care patients. 
7739,0,A referral model allows physicians to efficiently direct their patients to the intervention during a primary care visit. 
7740,0,"However, little is known of physicians' perspectives and utilization of the referral model for an online lifestyle modification intervention."
7741,1,The PCPs at six primary care clinics were asked to refer adult obese patients to a year-long online lifestyle intervention providing self-management support for weight loss. 
7742,1,"Following the 1-year intervention, all providers at the participating practices were surveyed regarding their views of the program. "
7743,1,Respondents completed survey items assessing their attitudes regarding the 1-year intensive weight loss intervention and identifying resources they would find helpful for assisting patients with weight loss. 
7744,1,Referring physicians were asked about their level of satisfaction with implementing the counseling services using standard electronic health record referral processes. 
7745,1,Attitudes toward obesity counseling among referring and nonreferring providers were compared. 
7746,1,Impressions of how smoothly the referral model of obesity treatment integrated with the clinical workflow were also quantified.
7747,2,"Of the 67 providers who completed the surveys, nonreferring providers (n=17) were more likely to prefer counseling themselves (P=.04) and to report having sufficient time to do so (P=.03) than referring providers (n=50) were. "
7748,2,"Nonreferring providers were more likely to report that their patients lacked computer skills (76%, 13/17 vs 34%, 17/50) or had less access to the Internet (65%, 11/17 vs 32%, 16/50)."
7749,3,Understanding providers' views and barriers regarding the integration of online tools will facilitate widespread implementation of an online lifestyle modification intervention.
7750,4,Increasing the Availability of Psychological Treatments: A Multinational Study of a Scalable Method for Training Therapists
7751,0,One of the major barriers to the dissemination and implementation of psychological treatments is the scarcity of suitably trained therapists. 
7752,0,"A highly scalable form of Web-centered therapist training, undertaken without external support, has recently been shown to have promise in promoting therapist competence."
7753,1,"A cohort of eligible therapists was recruited internationally and offered access to Web-centered training in enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy, a multicomponent, evidence-based, psychological treatment for any form of eating disorder. "
7754,1,No external support was provided during training. 
7755,1,Therapist competence was assessed using a validated competence measure before training and after 20 weeks.
7756,2,"A total of 806 therapists from 33 different countries expressed interest in the study, and 765 (94.9%) completed a pretraining assessment. "
7757,2,"The median number of training modules completed was 15 out of a possible 18 (interquartile range, IQR: 4-18), and 87.9% (531/604) reported that they treated at least one patient during training as recommended. "
7758,2,"Median pretraining competence score was 7 (IQR: 5-10, range: 0-19; N=765), and following training, it was 12 (IQR: 9-15, range: 0-20; N=577). "
7759,2,The expected change in competence scores from pretraining to posttraining was 3.5 (95% CI 3.1-3.8; P<.001). 
7760,2,"After training, 52% (300/574) of therapists with complete competence data met or exceeded the competence threshold, and 45% (95% CI 41-50) of those who had not met this threshold before training did so after training. "
7761,2,Compliance with training predicted both an increase in competence scores and meeting or exceeding the competence threshold. 
7762,2,"Expected change in competence score increased for each extra training module completed (0.19, 95% CI 0.13-0.25), and those who treated a suitable patient during training had an expected change in competence score 1.2 (95% CI 0.4-2.1) points higher than those who did not. "
7763,2,"Similarly, there was an association between meeting the competence threshold after training and the number of modules completed (odds ratio, OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.15), and treating at least one patient during training was associated with competence after training (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1)."
7764,3,Independent Web-centered training can successfully train large numbers of therapists dispersed across a wide geographical area. 
7765,3,This finding is of importance because the availability of a highly scalable method of training potentially increases the number of people who might receive effective psychological treatments.
7766,4,Behind the Scenes of Online Therapeutic Feedback in Blended Therapy for Depression: Mixed-Methods Observational Study
7767,0,"In Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapies (iCBT), written feedback by therapists is a substantial part of therapy. "
7768,0,"However, it is not yet known how this feedback should be given best and which specific therapist behaviors and content are most beneficial for patients. "
7769,0,"General instructions for written feedback are available, but the uptake and effectiveness of these instructions in iCBT have not been studied yet."
7770,1,Adults receiving blended CBT (10 online sessions in combination with 5 face-to-face sessions) for depression in routine mental health care were recruited in the context of the European implementation project MasterMind. 
7771,1,"A qualitative content analysis was used to identify therapist behaviors in online written feedback messages, and a checklist for the feedback instruction adherence of the therapists was developed. "
7772,1,"Correlations were explored between the therapist behaviors, therapist instruction adherence, and patient outcomes (number of completed online sessions and symptom change scores)."
7773,2,"A total of 45 patients (73%, 33/45 female, mean age 35.9 years) received 219 feedback messages given by 19 therapists (84%, 16/19 female). "
7774,2,"The most frequently used therapist behaviors were informing, encouraging, and affirming. "
7775,2,"However, these were not related to patient outcomes. "
7776,2,"Although infrequently used, confronting was positively correlated with session completion (rho=.342, P=.02). "
7777,2,Therapists adhered to most of the feedback instructions. 
7778,2,"Only 2 feedback aspects were correlated with session completion: the more therapists adhere to instructions containing structure (limiting to 2 subjects and sending feedback within 3 working days) and readability (short sentences and short paragraphs), the less online sessions were completed (rho=-.340, P=.02 and rho=-.361, P=.02, respectively). "
7779,2,No associations were found with depression symptom change scores.
7780,3,The therapist behaviors found in this study are comparable to previous research. 
7781,3,The findings suggest that online feedback instructions for therapists provide sufficient guidance to communicate in a supportive and positive manner with patients. 
7782,3,"However, the instructions might be improved by adding more therapeutic techniques besides the focus on style and form."
7783,4,Integration of a Technology-Based Mental Health Screening Program Into Routine Practices of Primary Health Care Services in Peru (The Allillanchu Project): Development and Implementation
7784,0,"Despite their high prevalence and significant burden, mental disorders such as depression remain largely underdiagnosed and undertreated."
7785,1,"The project had a multiphase design: formative study, development of intervention components, and implementation. "
7786,1,"The intervention combined three strategies: training of PHC providers (PHCPs), task shifting the detection and referral of mental disorders, and a mobile health (mHealth) component comprising a screening app followed by motivational and reminder short message service (SMS) to identify at-risk patients. "
7787,1,"The intervention was implemented by 22 PHCPs from five health centers, working in antenatal care, tuberculosis, chronic diseases, and HIV or AIDS services."
7788,2,"Over a period of 9 weeks, from September 2015 to November 2015, 733 patients were screened by the 22 PHCPs during routine consultations, and 762 screening were completed in total. "
7789,2,"The chronic diseases (49.9%, 380/762) and antenatal care services (36.7%, 380/762) had the higher number of screenings. "
7790,2,"Time constraints and workload were the main barriers to implementing the screening, whereas the use of technology, training, and supervision of the PHCPs by the research team were identified as facilitators. "
7791,2,"Of the 733 patients, 21.7% (159/733) screened positively and were advised to seek specialized care. "
7792,2,"Out of the 159 patients with a positive screening result, 127 had a follow-up interview, 72.4% (92/127) reported seeking specialized care, and 55.1% (70/127) stated seeing a specialist. "
7793,2,Both patients and PHCPs recognized the utility of the screening and identified some key challenges to its wider implementation.
7794,3,The use of a screening app supported by training and supervision is feasible and uncovers a high prevalence of unidentified psychological symptoms in primary care. 
7795,3,"To increase its sustainability and utility, this procedure can be incorporated into the routine practices of existing health care services, following tailoring to the resources and features of each service. "
7796,3,"The early detection of psychological symptoms by a PHCP within a regular consultation, followed by adequate advice and support, can lead to a significant percentage of patients accessing specialized care and reducing the treatment gap of mental disorders."
7797,4,Technological Health Intervention in Population Aging to Assist People to Work Smarter not Harder: Qualitative Study
7798,0,Technology-based health care has been promoted as an effective tool to enable clinicians to work smarter. 
7799,0,"However, some health stakeholders believe technology will compel users to work harder by creating extra work."
7800,1,A qualitative methodology was adopted to obtain insightful inputs from deeper probing. 
7801,1,"Taiwan was selected as a typical case study, given its aging population, advanced technology, and comprehensive health care system. "
7802,1,"This study investigated 38 stakeholders in the health care ecosystem through in-depth interviews and focus groups, which provides an open, flexible, and enlightening way to study complex, dynamic, and interactive situations through informal conversation or a more structured, directed discussion."
7803,2,"First, respondents indicated that the use of technology can enable seamless patient care and clinical benefits such as flexibility in time management. "
7804,2,"Second, the results suggested that a leader's vision, authority, and management skills might influence success in health care innovation. "
7805,2,"Finally, the results implied that both internal and external organizational governance are highly relevant for implementing technology-based innovation in health care."
7806,3,This study provided Taiwanese perspectives on how to intelligently use technology to benefit health care and debated the perception that technology prevents human interaction between clinicians and patients.
7807,4,Effect of Contract Compliance Rate to a Fourth-Generation Telehealth Program on the Risk of Hospitalization in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease: Retrospective Cohort Study
7808,0,Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in Taiwan and it is associated with high all-cause mortality. 
7809,0,We have shown in a previous paper that a fourth-generation telehealth program is associated with lower all-cause mortality compared to usual care with a hazard ratio of 0.866 (95% CI 0.837-0.896).
7810,1,We retrospectively analyzed 715 patients receiving the telehealth care program. 
7811,1,Contract compliance rate was defined as the percentage of days covered by the telehealth service before hospitalization. 
7812,1,"Patients were stratified into three groups according to renal function status: (1) normal renal function, (2) CKD, or (3) end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and on maintenance dialysis. "
7813,1,The outcome measurements were first cardiovascular and all-cause hospitalizations. 
7814,1,"The association between contract compliance rate, renal function status, and hospitalization risk was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates."
7815,2,The median follow-up duration was 694 days (IQR 338-1163). 
7816,2,Contract compliance rate had a triphasic relationship with cardiovascular and all-cause hospitalizations. 
7817,2,Patients with low or very high contract compliance rates were associated with a higher risk of hospitalization. 
7818,2,Patients with CKD or ESRD were also associated with a higher risk of hospitalization. 
7819,2,"Moreover, we observed a significant interaction between the effects of renal function status and contract compliance rate on the risk of hospitalization: patients with ESRD, who were on dialysis, had an increased risk of hospitalization at a lower contract compliance rate, compared with patients with normal renal function or CKD."
7820,3,Our study showed that there was a triphasic relationship between contract compliance rate to the telehealth program and risk of hospitalization. 
7821,3,"Renal function status was associated with risk of hospitalization among these patients, and there was a significant interaction with contract compliance rate."
7822,4,Blended Interventions to Change Behavior in Patients With Chronic Somatic Disorders: Systematic Review
7823,0,Blended behavior change interventions combine therapeutic guidance with online care. 
7824,0,This new way of delivering health care is supposed to stimulate patients with chronic somatic disorders in taking an active role in their disease management. 
7825,0,"However, knowledge about the effectiveness of blended behavior change interventions and how they should be composed is scattered."
7826,1,"We searched for randomized controlled trials published from 2000 to April 2017 in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. "
7827,1,Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. 
7828,1,"Study characteristics, intervention characteristics, and outcome data were extracted. "
7829,1,Studies were sorted based on their comparison group. 
7830,1,A best-evidence synthesis was conducted to summarize the effectiveness.
7831,2,A total of 25 out of the 29 included studies were of high quality. 
7832,2,Most studies (n=21; 72%) compared a blended intervention with no intervention. 
7833,2,"The majority of interventions focused on changing pain behavior (n=17; 59%), and the other interventions focused on lifestyle change (n=12; 41%). "
7834,2,"In addition, 26 studies (90%) focused on one type of behavior, whereas 3 studies (10%) focused on multiple behaviors. "
7835,2,A total of 23 studies (79%) mentioned a theory as basis for the intervention. 
7836,2,"The therapeutic guidance in most studies (n=18; 62%) was non face-to-face by using email, phone, or videoconferencing, and in the other studies (partly), it was face-to-face (n=11; 38%). "
7837,2,"In 26 studies (90%), the online care was provided via a website, and in 3 studies (10%) via an app. "
7838,2,"In 22 studies (76%), the therapeutic guidance and online care were integrated instead of two separate aspects. "
7839,2,"A total of 26 outcome measures were included in the evidence synthesis comparing blended interventions with no intervention: for the coping strategy catastrophizing, we found strong evidence for a significant effect. "
7840,2,"In addition, 1 outcome measure was included in the evidence synthesis comparing blended interventions with face-to-face interventions, but no evidence for a significant effect was found. "
7841,2,"A total of 6 outcome measures were included in the evidence synthesis comparing blended interventions with online interventions, but no evidence for a significant effect was found."
7842,3,"Blended behavior change interventions for patients with chronic somatic disorders show variety in the type of therapeutic guidance, the type of online care, and how these two delivery modes are integrated. "
7843,3,The evidence of the effectiveness of blended interventions is inconsistent and nonsignificant for most outcome measures. 
7844,3,Future research should focus on which type of blended intervention works for whom.
7845,4,Raising Awareness About Cervical Cancer Using Twitter: Content Analysis of the 2015 #SmearForSmear Campaign
7846,0,Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women under 45 years of age. 
7847,0,"To deal with the decrease of smear test coverage in the United Kingdom, a Twitter campaign called #SmearForSmear has been launched in 2015 for the European Cervical Cancer Prevention Week. "
7848,0,Its aim was to encourage women to take a selfie showing their lipstick going over the edge and post it on Twitter with a raising awareness message promoting cervical cancer screening. 
7849,0,The estimated audience was 500 million people. 
7850,0,Other public health campaigns have been launched on social media such as Movember to encourage participation and self-engagement. 
7851,0,Their result was unsatisfactory as their aim had been diluted to become mainly a social buzz.
7852,1,We conducted a 3-step content analysis of the English tweets tagged #SmearForSmear posted on Twitter for the 2015 European Cervical Cancer Prevention Week. 
7853,1,Data were collected using the Twitter application programming interface. 
7854,1,"Their extraction was based on an analysis grid generated by 2 independent researchers using a thematic analysis, validated by a strong Cohen kappa coefficient. "
7855,1,A total of 7 themes were coded for sensitizing tweets and 14 for Twitter users' status. 
7856,1,Verbatims were thematically and then statistically analyzed.
7857,2,A total of 3019 tweets were collected and 1881 were analyzed. 
7858,2,"Moreover, 69.96% of tweets had been posted by people living in the United Kingdom. "
7859,2,"A total of 57.36% of users were women, and sex was unknown in 35.99% of cases. "
7860,2,"In addition, 54.44% of the users had posted at least one selfie with smeared lipstick. "
7861,2,"Furthermore, 32.32% of tweets were sensitizing. "
7862,2,"Independent factors associated with posting sensitizing tweets were women who experienced an abnormal smear test (OR [odds ratio] 13.456, 95% CI 3.101-58.378, P<.001), female gender (OR 3.752, 95% CI 2.133-6.598, P<.001), and people who live in the United Kingdom (OR 2.097, 95% CI 1.447-3.038, P<.001). "
7863,2,"Nonsensitizing tweets were statistically more posted by a nonhealth or nonmedia company (OR 0.558, 95% CI 0.383-0.814, P<.001)."
7864,3,This study demonstrates that the success of a public health campaign using a social media platform depends on its ability to get its targets involved. 
7865,3,It also suggests the need to use social marketing to help its dissemination. 
7866,3,The clinical impact of this Twitter campaign to increase cervical cancer screening is yet to be evaluated.
7867,4,Reliability and Validity of the Telephone-Based eHealth Literacy Scale Among Older Adults: Cross-Sectional Survey
7868,0,Only a handful of studies have examined reliability and validity evidence of scores produced by the 8-item eHealth literacy Scale (eHEALS) among older adults. 
7869,0,Older adults are generally more comfortable responding to survey items when asked by a real person rather than by completing self-administered paper-and-pencil or online questionnaires. 
7870,0,"However, no studies have explored the psychometrics of this scale when administered to older adults over the telephone."
7871,1,Respondents (N=283) completed eHEALS as part of a cross-sectional landline telephone survey. 
7872,1,"Exploratory structural equation modeling (E-SEM) analyses examined model fit of eHEALS scores with 1-, 2-, and 3-factor structures. "
7873,1,Subsequent analyses based on the partial credit model explored the internal structure of eHEALS data.
7874,0,China launched its second health reform in 2010 with considerable investments in medical informatics (MI). 
7875,0,"However, to the best of our knowledge, research on the outcomes of this ambitious undertaking has been limited."
7876,1,"We conducted a quantitative and qualitative analysis of four MI conferences in China and two in the United States: China Medical Information Association Annual Symposium (CMIAAS), China Hospital Information Network Annual Conference (CHINC), China Health Information Technology Exchange Annual Conference (CHITEC), China Annual Proceeding of Medical Informatics (CPMI) versus the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) and Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS). "
7877,1,"The scale, composition, and regional distribution of attendees, topics, and research fields for each conference were summarized and compared."
7878,2,"CMIAAS and CPMI are mainstream academic conferences, while CHINC and CHITEC are industry conferences in China. "
7879,2,"Compared to HIMSS 2016, the meeting duration of CHITEC was 3 versus 5 days, the number of conference sessions was 132 versus 950+, the number of attendees was 5000 versus 40,000+, the number of vendors was 152 versus 1400+, the number of subforums was 12 versus 230, the number of preconference education symposiums and workshops was 0 versus 12, and the duration of preconference educational symposiums and workshops was 0 versus 1 day. "
7880,2,"Compared to AMIA, the meeting duration of Chinese CMIAAS was 2 versus 5 days, the number of conference sessions was 42 versus 110, the number of attendees was 200 versus 2500+, the number of vendors was 5 versus 75+, and the number of subforums was 4 versus 10. "
7881,2,"The number of preconference tutorials and working groups was 0 versus 29, and the duration of tutorials and working group was 0 versus 1.5 days."
7882,3,"Given the size of the Chinese economy and the substantial investment in MI, the output in terms of conferences remains low. "
7883,3,The impact of conferences on continuing education to professionals is not significant. 
7884,3,"Chinese researchers and professionals should approach MI with greater rigor, including validated research methods, formal training, and effective continuing education, in order to utilize knowledge gained by other countries and to expand collaboration."
7885,4,Defining and Predicting Patterns of Early Response in a Web-Based Intervention for Depression
7886,0,Web-based interventions for individuals with depressive disorders have been a recent focus of research and may be an effective adjunct to face-to-face psychotherapy or pharmacological treatment.
7887,1,We applied piecewise growth mixture modeling (PGMM) to identify different latent classes of early change in individuals with mild-to-moderate depression (n=409) who underwent a CBT-based web intervention for depression.
7888,2,"Overall, three latent classes were identified (N409): Two early response classes (n=158, n=185) and one early deterioration class (n=66). "
7889,2,"Latent classes differed in terms of outcome (P<.001) and adherence (P=.03) in regard to the number of modules (number of modules with a duration of at least 10 minutes) and the number of assessments (P<.001), but not in regard to the overall amount of time using the system. "
7890,2,Class membership significantly improved outcome prediction by 24.8% over patient intake characteristics (P<.001) and significantly added to the prediction of adherence (P=.04).
7891,3,"These findings suggest that in Web-based interventions outcome and adherence can be predicted by patterns of early change, which can inform treatment decisions and potentially help optimize the allocation of scarce clinical resources."
7892,4,Integrated Detection and Prediction of Influenza Activity for Real-Time Surveillance: Algorithm Design
7893,0,Influenza is a viral respiratory disease capable of causing epidemics that represent a threat to communities worldwide. 
7894,0,"The rapidly growing availability of electronic ""big data"" from diagnostic and prediagnostic sources in health care and public health settings permits advance of a new generation of methods for local detection and prediction of winter influenza seasons and influenza pandemics."
7895,1,An integrated detection and prediction method was formally defined based on a design rationale for influenza detection and prediction methods adapted for local surveillance. 
7896,1,"The novel method was retrospectively applied on data from the winter influenza season 2008-09 in a Swedish county (population 445,000). "
7897,1,Outcome data represented individuals who met a clinical case definition for influenza (based on International Classification of Diseases version 10 [ICD-10] codes) from an electronic health data repository. 
7898,1,Information from calls to a telenursing service in the county was used as syndromic data source.
7899,2,The novel integrated detection and prediction method is based on nonmechanistic statistical models and is designed for integration in local health information systems. 
7900,2,The method is divided into separate modules for detection and prediction of local influenza virus activity. 
7901,2,"The function of the detection module is to alert for an upcoming period of increased load of influenza cases on local health care (using influenza-diagnosis data), whereas the function of the prediction module is to predict the timing of the activity peak (using syndromic data) and its intensity (using influenza-diagnosis data). "
7902,2,"For detection modeling, exponential regression was used based on the assumption that the beginning of a winter influenza season has an exponential growth of infected individuals. "
7903,2,"For prediction modeling, linear regression was applied on 7-day periods at the time in order to find the peak timing, whereas a derivate of a normal distribution density function was used to find the peak intensity. "
7904,2,"We found that the integrated detection and prediction method detected the 2008-09 winter influenza season on its starting day (optimal timeliness 0 days), whereas the predicted peak was estimated to occur 7 days ahead of the factual peak and the predicted peak intensity was estimated to be 26% lower than the factual intensity (6.3 compared with 8.5 influenza-diagnosis cases/100,000)."
7905,3,Our detection and prediction method is one of the first integrated methods specifically designed for local application on influenza data electronically available for surveillance. 
7906,3,The performance of the method in a retrospective study indicates that further prospective evaluations of the methods are justified.
7907,4,Health-Related Internet Use in People With Cancer: Results From a Cross-Sectional Study in Two Outpatient Clinics in Sweden
7908,0,The access to various forms of support during the disease trajectory is crucial for people with cancer. 
7909,0,"The provision and use of Internet health services is increasing, and it is important to further investigate the preferences and demographical characteristics of its users. "
7910,0,Investigating the uptake and perceived value of Internet health services is a prerequisite to be able to meet the needs in the targeted group.
7911,1,"The health online support questionnaire (HOSQ), examining the incentives for health-related Internet support use, was administered in two Swedish outpatient hospital clinics. "
7912,1,"Of the 350 copies of the questionnaire handed out, 285 (81.4%) were returned, answered by persons with cancer who had completed treatment or were under active surveillance or another medical treatment."
7913,2,"A total of 215 (76.2%, 215/282) participants reported Internet use since being diagnosed with cancer. "
7914,2,"Internet-users were younger (P<.001), more likely to have a partner (P=.03), and had a higher level of education than nonusers (P<.001). "
7915,2,"The most common health-related activity on the Internet was searching for information (77.2%, 166/215), and users searched significantly more immediately after diagnosis compared with later on (P<.001). "
7916,2,Use of My Healthcare Contacts was considered the most valuable Internet activity. 
7917,2,Having a university degree (P<.001) and being younger in age (P=.01) were associated with a significantly higher frequency of health-related Internet use.
7918,3,People with cancer turn to the Internet for informational support that enables them to influence their care and to stay in touch with friends and relatives. 
7919,3,Demographical differences regarding the uptake of Web-based support remains. 
7920,3,This indicates a need for research on how to bridge this digital gap. 
7921,3,"By learning more about the use of health-related support on the Web among people with cancer, adequate support can be offered and potential strain reduced."
7922,1,A new taxonomy of eHealth websites is proposed to organize the largest eHealth websites. 
7923,1,An online measurement framework is developed that provides a precise and detailed measurement system. 
7924,1,Online panel data are used to accurately track and analyze detailed search behavior across 100 of the largest eHealth websites in the US and UK health care markets.
7925,2,"The health, medical, and lifestyle categories account for approximately 90% of online activity, and e-pharmacies, social media, and professional categories account for the remaining 10% of online activity. "
7926,2,Overall search penetration of eHealth websites is significantly higher in the private (United States) than the public market (United Kingdom). 
7927,2,Almost twice the number of eHealth users in the private market have adopted online search in the health and lifestyle categories and also spend more time per website than those in the public market. 
7928,2,The use of medical websites for specific conditions is almost identical in both markets. 
7929,2,The allocation of search effort across categories is similar in both the markets. 
7930,2,"For all categories, the vast majority of eHealth users only access one website within each category. "
7931,2,Those that conduct a search of two or more websites display very narrow search patterns. 
7932,2,"All users spend relatively little time on eHealth, that is, 3-7 minutes per website."
7933,3,The proposed online measurement framework exploits online panel data to provide a powerful and objective method of analyzing and exploring eHealth behavior. 
7934,3,The private health care system does appear to have an influence on eHealth search behavior in terms of search penetration and time spent per website in the health and lifestyle categories. 
7935,3,Two explanations are offered: (1) the personal incentive of medical costs in the private market incentivizes users to conduct online search; and (2) health care information is more easily accessible through health care professionals in the United Kingdom compared with the United States. 
7936,3,"However, the use of medical websites is almost identical, suggesting that patients interested in a specific condition have a motivation to search and evaluate health information, irrespective of the health care market. "
7937,3,The relatively low level of search in terms of the number of websites accessed and the average time per website raise important questions about the actual level of patient informedness in both the markets. 
7938,3,Areas for future research are outlined.
7939,4,Drivers and Barriers to Acceptance of Web-Based Aftercare of Patients in Inpatient Routine Care: A Cross-Sectional Survey
7940,0,"Web-based aftercare can help to stabilize treatment effects and support transition after inpatient treatment, yet uptake by patients seems limited in routine care and little is known about the mechanisms of adoption and implementation."
7941,0,Diabetes self-management education has been shown to be effective in controlled trials. 
7942,0,"The 6-week Better Choices, Better Health-Diabetes (BCBH-D) self-management program was also associated with an improvement in health outcomes in a 6-month translation study."
7943,1,"Web-based programs were administered nationally, whereas face-to-face workshops took place in Atlanta, Indianapolis, and St Louis. "
7944,1,"Self-report questionnaires were either Web-based or administered by mail, at baseline and 1 year, and collected health and health-behavior measures. "
7945,1,HbA1c blood samples were collected via mailed kits. 
7946,1,"A previous 6-month study found statistically significant improvements in 13 of 14 outcome measures, including HbA1c. "
7947,1,"For this study, paired t test compared baseline with 1-year outcomes. "
7948,1,"Subgroup analyses determined whether participants with specific conditions improved (high HbA1c, depression, hypoglycemia, nonadherence to medication, no aerobic exercise). "
7949,1,The percentage of participants with improvements in effect size of at least 0.4 in at least 1 of the 5 measures was calculated.
7950,2,A total of 857 participants with 1-year data (69.7% of baseline participants) demonstrated statistically significant 1-year improvements in 13 of 15 outcome measures; 79.9% (685/ 857) of participants showed improvements in effect size of 0.4 or greater in at least 1 of the 5 criterial measures.
7951,3,Participants had small but significant benefits in multiple measures. 
7952,3,Improvements previously noted at 6 months were maintained or amplified at 1 year.
7953,4,Guidelines for Developing and Reporting Machine Learning Predictive Models in Biomedical Research: A Multidisciplinary View
7954,0,"As more and more researchers are turning to big data for new opportunities of biomedical discoveries, machine learning models, as the backbone of big data analysis, are mentioned more often in biomedical journals. "
7955,0,"However, owing to the inherent complexity of machine learning methods, they are prone to misuse. "
7956,0,"Because of the flexibility in specifying machine learning models, the results are often insufficiently reported in research articles, hindering reliable assessment of model validity and consistent interpretation of model outputs."
7957,1,"A multidisciplinary panel of machine learning experts, clinicians, and traditional statisticians were interviewed, using an iterative process in accordance with the Delphi method."
7958,2,The process produced a set of guidelines that consists of (1) a list of reporting items to be included in a research article and (2) a set of practical sequential steps for developing predictive models.
7959,3,A set of guidelines was generated to enable correct application of machine learning models and consistent reporting of model specifications and results in biomedical research. 
7960,3,"We believe that such guidelines will accelerate the adoption of big data analysis, particularly with machine learning methods, in the biomedical research community."
7961,4,Short-Term Effectiveness of a Mobile Phone App for Increasing Physical Activity and Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet in Primary Care: A Randomized Controlled Trial (EVIDENT II Study)
7962,0,"The use of mobile phone apps for improving lifestyles has become generalized in the population, although little is still known about their effectiveness in improving health."
7963,1,"A randomized, multicenter clinical trial was carried out. "
7964,1,A total of 833 participants were recruited in six primary care centers in Spain through random sampling: 415 in the app+counseling group and 418 in the counseling only group. 
7965,1,Counseling on PA and the Mediterranean diet was given to both groups. 
7966,1,The app+counseling participants additionally received training in the use of an app designed to promote PA and the Mediterranean diet over a 3-month period. 
7967,1,PA was measured with the 7-day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) questionnaire and an accelerometer; adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener questionnaire.
7968,2,"Participants were predominantly female in both the app+counseling (249/415, 60.0%) and counseling only (268/418, 64.1%) groups, with a mean age of 51.4 (SD 12.1) and 52.3 (SD 12.0) years, respectively. "
7969,2,"Leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) by 7-day PAR increased in the app+counseling (mean 29, 95% CI 5-53 min/week; P=.02) but not in the counseling only group (mean 17.4, 95% CI -18 to 53 min/week; P=.38). "
7970,2,No differences in increase of activity were found between the two groups. 
7971,2,The accelerometer recorded a decrease in PA after 3 months in both groups: MVPA mean -55.3 (95% CI -75.8 to -34.9) min/week in app+ counseling group and mean -30.1 (95% CI -51.8 to -8.4) min/week in counseling only group. 
7972,2,"Adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased in both groups (8.4% in app+ counseling and 10.4% in counseling only group), with an increase in score of 0.42 and 0.53 points, respectively (P<.001), but no difference between groups (P=.86)."
7973,3,"Leisure-time MVPA increased more in the app+ counseling than counseling only group, although no difference was found when comparing the increase between the two groups. "
7974,3,"Counseling accompanied by printed materials appears to be effective in improving adherence to the Mediterranean diet, although the app does not increase adherence."
7975,4,Adolescent Female Text Messaging Preferences to Prevent Pregnancy After an Emergency Department Visit: A Qualitative Analysis
7976,0,Over 15 million adolescents use the emergency department (ED) each year in the United States. 
7977,0,Adolescent females who use the ED for medical care have been found to be at high risk for unintended pregnancy. 
7978,0,"Given that adolescents represent the largest users of text messaging and are receptive to receiving text messages related to their sexual health, the ED visit represents an opportunity for intervention."
7979,1,"We conducted semistructured, open-ended interviews in one urban ED in the United States with adolescent females aged 14-19 years. "
7980,1,"Eligible subjects were adolescents who were sexually active in the past 3 months, presented to the ED for a reproductive health complaint, owned a mobile phone, and did not use effective contraception. "
7981,1,"Using an interview guide, enrollment continued until saturation of key themes. "
7982,1,The investigators designed sample text messages using the Health Beliefs Model and participants viewed these on a mobile phone. 
7983,1,"The team recorded, transcribed, and coded interviews based on thematic analysis using the qualitative analysis software NVivo and Excel."
7984,2,"Participants (n=14) were predominantly Hispanic (13/14; 93%), insured (13/14; 93%), ED users in the past year (12/14; 86%), and frequent text users (10/14; 71% had sent or received >30 texts per day). "
7985,2,"All were interested in receiving text messages from the ED about pregnancy prevention, favoring messages that were ""brief,"" ""professional,"" and ""nonaccusatory."" Respondents favored texts with links to websites, repeated information regarding places to receive ""confidential"" care, and focused information on contraception options and misconceptions. "
7986,2,"Preferences for text message frequency varied from daily to monthly, with random hours of delivery to maintain ""surprise."" No participant feared that text messages would violate her privacy."
7987,3,Adolescent female patients at high pregnancy risk are interested in ED-based pregnancy prevention provided by texting. 
7988,3,"Understanding preferences for the content, frequency, and timing of messages can guide in designing future interventions in the ED."
7989,4,The Inclusion of Ethnic Minority Patients and the Role of Language in Telehealth Trials for Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review
7990,0,"Type 2 diabetes is a serious, pervasive metabolic condition that disproportionately affects ethnic minority patients. "
7991,0,Telehealth interventions can facilitate type 2 diabetes monitoring and prevent secondary complications. 
7992,0,"However, trials designed to test the effectiveness of telehealth interventions may underrecruit or exclude ethnic minority patients, with language a potential barrier to recruitment. "
7993,0,The underrepresentation of minorities in trials limits the external validity of the findings for this key patient demographic.
7994,1,Telehealth RCTs published in refereed journals targeting type 2 diabetes as a primary condition for adults in Western majority English-speaking countries were included. 
7995,1,"Ethnically targeted RCTs were excluded from the main review, but were included in a post hoc subgroup analysis. "
7996,1,"Abstract and full-text screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction were independently conducted by two reviewers."
7997,2,"Of 3358 records identified in the search, 79 articles comprising 58 RCTs were included. "
7998,2,"Nearly two-thirds of the RCTs (38/58) reported on the ethnic composition of participants, with a median proportion of 23.5% patients (range 0%-97.7%). "
7999,2,"Fourteen studies (24%) that included at least 30% minority patients were all US-based, predominantly recruited from urban areas, and described the target population as underserved, financially deprived, or uninsured. "
8000,2,Eight of these 14 studies (57%) offered intervention materials in a language other than English or employed bilingual staff. 
8001,2,Half of all identified RCTs (29/58) included language proficiency as a participant-screening criterion. 
8002,2,"Language proficiency was operationalized using nonstandardized measures (eg, having sufficient ""verbal fluency""), with only three studies providing reasons for excluding patients on language grounds."
8003,3,"There was considerable variability across studies in the inclusion of ethnic minority patients in RCTs, with higher participation rates in countries with legislation to mandate their inclusion (eg, United States) than in those without such legislation (eg, United Kingdom). "
8004,3,"Less than 25% of the RCTs recruited a sizeable proportion of ethnic minorities, which raises concerns about external validity. "
8005,3,"The lack of objective measures or common procedures for assessing language proficiency across trials implies that language-related eligibility decisions are often based on trial recruiters' impressionistic judgments, which could be subject to bias. "
8006,3,The variability and inconsistent reporting on ethnicity and other socioeconomic factors in descriptions of research participants could be more specifically emphasized in trial reporting guidelines to promote best practice.
8007,4,Innovatively Supporting Teachers Implementation of School-Based Sex Education: Developing A Web-Based Coaching Intervention From Problem to Solution
8008,0,Full program implementation is crucial for effectiveness but is often overlooked or insufficiently considered during development of behavioral change interventions. 
8009,0,"For school-based health promotion programs, teachers are key players in program implementation, but teacher support in this phase is mostly limited to technical support and information. "
8010,0,"To ensure optimal implementation of the Dutch school-based sexual health program Long Live Love, a Web-based coaching website was developed to support teachers in completeness and fidelity of program implementation."
8011,1,The intervention mapping (IM) protocol was applied for the development of a theory-and evidence-based intervention. 
8012,1,"The IM process begins with (1) a needs assessment, followed by (2) the formulation of change objectives, (3) the selection of theory-based intervention methods and practical applications that take the parameters for effectiveness into consideration, (4) integration of practical applications into an organized program, (5) planning for adoption, implementation, and sustainability of the program, and finally, (6) generating an evaluation plan to measure program effectiveness."
8013,2,Teacher's implementation behavior was characterized by inconsistently selecting parts of the program and not delivering (all) lessons as intended by program developers. 
8014,2,"Teachers, however, did not perceive this behavior as problematic, revealing the discrepancy between teacher's actual and perceived need for support in delivering Long Live Love lessons with completeness and fidelity. "
8015,2,"Teachers did, however, acknowledge different difficulties they encountered which could potentially negatively influence the quality of implementation. "
8016,2,"With the IM protocol, this Web-based coaching intervention was developed based on a concept of unobtrusive coaching, by and for teachers, to bring about change in teachers' implementation behavior."
8017,3,This paper provides an example of a Web-based intervention to bring about behavioral change in a target group of intermediaries who lack intrinsic motivation for coaching and who's perceptions differ from their actual problematic behavior. 
8018,3,The IM protocol is a useful tool for guiding the scientific development of interventions and making them compatible with the needs and preferences of the target group.
8019,4,Follow #eHealth2011: Measuring the Role and Effectiveness of Online and Social Media in Increasing the Outreach of a Scientific Conference
8020,0,"Social media promotion is increasingly adopted by organizers of industry and academic events; however, the success of social media strategies is rarely questioned or the real impact scientifically analyzed."
8021,1,"Online communication channels Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and a Liveblog were trialed and their impact measured on outreach during five phases of an eHealth conference: the setup, active and last-minute promotion phases before the conference, the actual event, and after the conference."
8022,2,Planned outreach through online channels and social media before and during the event reached an audience several magnitudes larger in size than would have been possible using traditional means. 
8023,2,"In the particular case of eHealth 2011, the outreach using traditional means would have been 74 attendees plus 23 extra as sold proceedings and the number of downloaded articles from the online proceedings (4107 until October 2013). "
8024,2,The audience for the conference reached via online channels and social media was estimated at more than 5300 in total during the event. 
8025,2,The role of Twitter for promotion before the event was complemented by an increased usage of the website and Facebook during the event followed by a sharp increase of views of posters on Flickr after the event.
8026,3,"Although our case study is focused on a particular audience around eHealth 2011, our framework provides a template for redefining ""audience"" and outreach of events, merging traditional physical and virtual communities and providing an outline on how these could be successfully reached in clearly defined event phases."
8027,4,Trial Promoter: A Web-Based Tool for Boosting the Promotion of Clinical Research Through Social Media
8028,0,"Scarce information about clinical research, in particular clinical trials, is among the top reasons why potential participants do not take part in clinical studies. "
8029,0,"Without volunteers, on the other hand, clinical research and the development of novel approaches to preventing, diagnosing, and treating disease are impossible. "
8030,0,Promising digital options such as social media have the potential to work alongside traditional methods to boost the promotion of clinical research. 
8031,0,"However, investigators and research institutions are challenged to leverage these innovations while saving time and resources."
8032,1,"Trial Promoter is developed in Ruby on Rails, HTML, cascading style sheet (CSS), and JavaScript. "
8033,1,"In order to test the tool and the correctness of the generated messages, clinical trials (n= 46) were randomized into social media messages and distributed via the microblogging social media platform Twitter and the social network Facebook. "
8034,1,The percent correct was calculated to determine the probability with which Trial Promoter generates accurate messages.
8035,2,"During a 10-week testing phase, Trial Promoter automatically generated and published 525 user-friendly social media messages on Twitter and Facebook. "
8036,2,"On average, Trial Promoter correctly used the message templates and substituted the message parameters (text, URLs, and disease hashtags) 97.7% of the time (1563/1600)."
8037,3,Trial Promoter may serve as a promising tool to render clinical trial promotion more efficient while requiring limited resources. 
8038,3,It supports the distribution of any research or other types of content. 
8039,3,The Trial Promoter code and installation instructions are freely available online.
8040,4,Comparison Between a Self-Administered and Supervised Version of a Web-Based Cognitive Test Battery: Results From the NutriNet-Sante Cohort Study
8041,0,"Dementia is a major public health problem, and repeated cognitive data from large epidemiological studies could help to develop efficient measures of early prevention. "
8042,0,Data collection by self-administered online tools could drastically reduce the logistical and financial burden of such large-scale investigations. 
8043,0,"In this context, it is important to obtain data concerning the comparability of such new online tools with traditional, supervised modes of cognitive assessment."
8044,1,"The test battery included four tests, measuring, among others aspects, psychomotor speed, attention, executive function, episodic memory, working memory, and associative memory. "
8045,1,"Both versions of the cognitive battery were completed by 189 volunteers (either self-administered version first, n= 99, or supervised version first, n= 90). "
8046,1,Subjects also completed a satisfaction questionnaire. 
8047,1,Concordance was assessed by Spearman correlation.
8048,2,Agreement between both versions varied according to the investigated cognitive task and outcome variable. 
8049,2,Spearman correlations ranged between.42 and.73. 
8050,2,"Moreover, a majority of participants responded that they ""absolutely ""or ""rather ""agreed that the duration of the self-administered battery was acceptable (184/185, 99.5%), that the tasks were amusing (162/185, 87.6%), that the instructions were sufficiently detailed (168/185; 90.8%) and understandable (164/185, 88.7%), and that they had overall enjoyed the test battery (182/185, 98.4%)."
8051,3,The self-administered version of the Web-based NutriCog cognitive test battery provided similar information as the supervised version. 
8052,3,"Thus, integrating repeated cognitive evaluations into large cohorts via the implementation of self-administered online versions of traditional test batteries appears to be feasible."
8053,4,Crowdsourcing and the Accuracy of Online Information Regarding Weight Gain in Pregnancy: A Descriptive Study
8054,0,"Excess weight gain affects nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States and is a strong risk factor for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including long-term obesity. "
8055,0,"The Internet is a prominent source of information during pregnancy; however, the accuracy of this online information is unknown."
8056,1,A descriptive study was used to identify and search frequently used phrases related to weight gain during pregnancy on the Google search engine. 
8057,1,"The first 10 webpages of each query were characterized by type and then assessed for accuracy and completeness, as compared to Institute of Medicine guidelines, using crowdsourcing."
8058,2,"A total of 114 queries were searched, yielding 305 unique webpages. "
8059,2,"Of these webpages, 181 (59.3%) included information regarding weight gain during pregnancy. "
8060,2,"Out of 181 webpages, 62 (34.3%) contained no specific recommendations, 48 (26.5%) contained accurate but incomplete recommendations, 41 (22.7%) contained complete and accurate recommendations, and 22 (12.2%) were inaccurate. "
8061,2,"Webpages were most commonly from for-profit websites (112/181, 61.9%), followed by government (19/181, 10.5%), medical organizations or associations (13/181, 7.2%), and news sites (12/181, 6.6%). "
8062,2,"The largest proportion of for-profit sites contained no specific recommendations (44/112, 39.3%). "
8063,2,"Among pages that provided inaccurate information (22/181, 12.2%), 68% (15/22) were from for-profit sites."
8064,3,"For-profit websites dominate the online space with regard to weight gain during pregnancy and largely contain incomplete, inaccurate, or no specific recommendations. "
8065,3,This represents a significant information gap regarding an important risk factor for obesity among mothers and infants. 
8066,3,Our findings suggest that greater clinical and public health efforts to disseminate accurate information regarding healthy weight gain during pregnancy may help prevent significant morbidity and may support healthier pregnancies among at-risk women and children.
8067,4,Enhancement of Self-Monitoring in a Web-Based Weight Loss Program by Extra Individualized Feedback and Reminders: Randomized Trial
8068,0,Self-monitoring is an essential behavioral strategy for effective weight loss programs. 
8069,0,"Traditionally, self-monitoring has been achieved using paper-based records. "
8070,0,"However, technology is now more frequently used to deliver treatment programs to overweight and obese adults. "
8071,0,"Information technologies, such as the Internet and mobile phones, allow innovative intervention features to be incorporated into treatment that may facilitate greater adherence to self-monitoring processes, provide motivation for behavior change, and ultimately lead to greater weight loss success."
8072,1,"We randomly assigned a sample of 301 adults (mean age 42.3 years; body mass index 31.3 kg/m2; female 176/301, 58.5%) to the basic or enhanced group. "
8073,1,"The basic program included tools for self-monitoring (online food and exercise diary, and a weekly weigh-in log) with some feedback and reminders to weigh in (by text or email). "
8074,1,"The enhanced program included the basic components, as well as extra individualized feedback on self-monitoring entries and reminders (by text, email, or telephone) to engage with self-monitoring tools. "
8075,1,"We evaluated the level of self-monitoring by examining the consistency of self-monitoring of food, exercise, and weight during the 12 weeks. "
8076,1,"Consistency was defined as the number of weeks during which participants completed a criterion number of entries (ie, >= 3 days of online food or exercise diary records per week and >= 1 weigh-in per week)."
8077,2,"The enhanced group's consistency of use of self-monitoring tools was significantly greater than that of the basic group throughout the 12 weeks (median consistency for food 8 vs 3 weeks, respectively, P<. "
8078,2,"001; for exercise 2.5 vs 1 weeks, respectively, P=.003)."
8079,3,"Enhanced features, including additional individualized feedback and reminders, are effective in enhancing self-monitoring behaviors in a Web-based weight loss program."
8080,4,Effect of the Web-Based Intervention MyPlan 1.0 on Self-Reported Fruit and Vegetable Intake in Adults Who Visit General Practice: A Quasi-Experimental Trial
8081,0,"Web-based interventions typically have small intervention effects on adults' health behavior because they primarily target processes leading to an intention to change leaving individuals in an intention-behavior gap, they often occur without contact with health care providers, and a limited amount of feedback is provided only at the beginning of these interventions, but not further on in the behavior change process. "
8082,0,"Therefore, we developed a Web-based intervention (""MyPlan 1.0"") to promote healthy behavior in adults. "
8083,0,The intervention was based on a self-regulation perspective that also targets postintentional processes and guides individuals during all phases of behavior change.
8084,1,Adults (>= 18 years) were recruited in 19 Flemish general practices. 
8085,1,"In each general practice, patients were systematically allocated by a researcher either for the intervention group (researchers' intervention group) or the waiting-list control group that received general advice. "
8086,1,"In a third group, the GP recruited adults for the intervention (GPs intervention group). "
8087,1,"The two intervention groups filled in evaluation questionnaires and received MyPlan 1.0 for a behavior of choice (fruit, vegetable, or physical activity). "
8088,1,The waiting-list control group filled in the evaluation questionnaires and received only general information. 
8089,1,"Self-reported fruit and vegetable intake were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 week (T1), and 1 month (T2) postbaseline. "
8090,1,"Three-level (general practice, adults, time) linear regression models were conducted in MLwiN."
8091,2,A total of 426 adults initially agreed to participate (control group: n=149; GPs' intervention group: n=41; researchers' intervention group: n=236). 
8092,2,"A high attrition rate was observed in both intervention groups (71.8%, 199/277) and in the control group (59.1%, 88/149). "
8093,2,"In comparison to no change in the control group, both the GPs' intervention group (fruit: chi(2)(1)=10.9, P=.004; vegetable: chi(2)(1)=5.3, P=.02) and the researchers' intervention group (fruit: chi(2)(1)=18.0, P=.001; vegetable: chi(2)(1)=12.8, P<.001) increased their intake of fruit and vegetables."
8094,3,"A greater increase in fruit and vegetable intake was found when the Web-based intervention MyPlan 1.0 was used compared to usual care of health promotion in general practice (ie, flyers with general information). "
8095,3,"However, further investigation on which (or combinations of which) behavior change techniques are effective, how to increase response rates, and the influence of delivery mode in routine practice is required."
8096,4,Use of the Internet for Sexual Health Among Sexually Experienced Persons Aged 16 to 44 Years: Evidence from a Nationally Representative Survey of the British Population
8097,0,Those who go online regarding their sexual health are potential users of new Internet-based sexual health interventions. 
8098,0,Understanding the size and characteristics of this population is important in informing intervention design and delivery.
8099,1,Complex survey analysis of data from 8926 sexually experienced persons aged 16-44 years in a 2010-2012 probability survey of Britain's resident population. 
8100,1,Prevalence of recent (past year) use of Internet sources for key sexual health reasons was estimated. 
8101,1,Factors associated with use of information/support websites were identified using logistic regression to calculate age-adjusted odds ratios (AORs).
8102,2,"Recent Internet use for chlamydia/HIV testing or STI treatment (combined) was very low (men: 0.31%; women: 0.16%), whereas 2.35% of men and 0.51% of women reported obtaining condoms/contraceptives online. "
8103,2,"Additionally, 4.49% of men and 4.57% of women reported recent use of information/support websites for advice/help with their sex lives. "
8104,2,"Prevalence declined with age (men 16-24 years: 7.7%; 35-44 years: 1.84%, P<.001; women 16-24 years: 7.8%; 35-44 years: 1.84%, P<.001). "
8105,2,"Use of information/support websites was strongly associated with men's higher socioeconomic status (managerial/professional vs semiroutine/routine: AOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.27-2.93, P<.001). "
8106,2,"Despite no overall association with area-level deprivation, those in densely populated urban areas were more likely to report use of information/support websites than those living in rural areas (men: AOR 3.38, 95% CI 1.68-6.77, P<.001; women: AOR 2.51, 95% CI 1.34-4.70, P<.001). "
8107,2,"No statistically significant association was observed with number of sex partners reported after age adjustment, but use was more common among men reporting same-sex partners (last 5 years: AOR 2.44, 95% CI 1.27-4.70), women reporting sex with multiple partners without condoms (last year: AOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.11-3.26), and, among both sexes, reporting seeking sex online (last year, men: AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.16-2.79; women: AOR 3.00, 95% CI 1.76-5.13). "
8108,2,No association was observed with reporting STI diagnosis/es (last 5 years) or ( after age adjustment) recent use of any STI service or non-Internet sexual health seeking.
8109,3,A minority in Britain used the Internet for the sexual health reasons examined. 
8110,3,"Use of information/support websites was reported by those at greater STI risk, including younger people, indicating that demand for online STI services, and Internet-based sexual health interventions in general, may increase over time in this and subsequent cohorts. "
8111,3,"However, the impact on health inequalities needs addressing during design and evaluation of online sexual health interventions so that they maximize public health benefit."
8112,4,Establishing and Governing e-Mental Health Care in Australia: A Systematic Review of Challenges and A Call For Policy-Focussed Research
8113,0,Growing evidence attests to the efficacy of e-mental health services. 
8114,0,"There is less evidence on how to facilitate the safe, effective, and sustainable implementation of these services."
8115,1,"Following the PRISMA protocol, we identified research (1) conducted in Australia, (2) on e-mental health services, (3) for depressive or anxiety disorders, and (4) on e-mental health usage, such as barriers and facilitators to use. "
8116,1,"Databases searched included Cochrane, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest Social Science, and Google Scholar. "
8117,1,Sources were assessed according to area and level of policy relevance.
8118,2,The search yielded 1081 studies; 30 studies were included for analysis. 
8119,2,Most reported on self-selected samples and samples of online help-seekers. 
8120,2,"Studies indicate that e-mental health services are predominantly used by females, and those who are more educated and socioeconomically advantaged. "
8121,2,Ethnicity was infrequently reported on. 
8122,2,"Studies examining consumer preferences found a preference for face-to-face therapy over e-therapies, but not an aversion to e-therapy. "
8123,2,"Content relevant to governance was predominantly related to the organizational dimensions of e-mental health services, followed by implications for community education. "
8124,2,Financing and payment for e-services and governance of the information communication technology were least commonly discussed.
8125,3,Little research focuses explicitly on policy development and implementation planning; most research provides an e-services perspective. 
8126,3,Research is needed to provide community and policy-maker perspectives. 
8127,3,General population studies of prospective treatment seekers that include ethnicity and socioeconomic status and quantify relative preferences for all treatment modalities are necessary.
8128,4,Potential and Challenges in Collecting Social and Behavioral Data on Adolescent Alcohol Norms: Comparing Respondent-Driven Sampling and Web-Based Respondent-Driven Sampling
8129,0,Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a method successfully used to research hard-to-access populations. 
8130,0,"Few studies have explored the use of the Internet and social media with RDS, known as Web-based RDS (WebRDS). "
8131,0,"This study explored the use of combining both ""traditional"" RDS and WebRDS to examine the influences on adolescent alcohol use."
8132,1,Process evaluation data collected from research staff throughout the study were used to assess the challenges and solutions of RDS and WebRDS. 
8133,1,Pearson chi-square test (Fisher's exact test if applicable) was used to compare the differences in sociodemographics and drinking behavior between data collected by RDS and WebRDS.
8134,2,"Of the total sample (N = 1012), 232 adolescents were recruited by RDS and 780 by WebRDS. "
8135,2,"A significantly larger proportion of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (P<.001) participants who spoke English as their main language at home (P=.03), and of middle and lower socioeconomic status (P<.001) was found in the RDS sample. "
8136,2,The RDS sample was also found to have a higher occurrence of past 7-day drinking (P<.001) and past 7-day risky drinking (P=.004). 
8137,2,"No significant differences in gender, age, past month alcohol use, and lifetime alcohol use were observed between the RDS and WebRDS samples. "
8138,2,"This study revealed RDS and WebRDS used similar lengths of chains for recruiting participants; however, WebRDS conducted a faster rate of recruitment at a lower average cost per participant compared to RDS."
8139,3,Using WebRDS resulted in significant improvements in the recruitment rate and was a more effective and efficient use of resources than the traditional RDS method. 
8140,3,"However, WebRDS resulted in partially different sample characteristics to traditional RDS. "
8141,3,This potential effect should be considered when selecting the most appropriate data collection method.
8142,4,Heart Failure Telemonitoring in Japan and Sweden: A Cross-Sectional Survey
8143,0,Telemonitoring of heart failure (HF) patients is increasingly discussed at conferences and addressed in research. 
8144,0,"However, little is known about actual use in specific countries."
8145,1,This study used a cross-sectional survey of non-invasive HF telemonitoring. 
8146,1,"A total of 378 Japanese (120 cardiologists, 258 nurses) and 120 Swedish (39 cardiologists, 81 nurses) health care professionals from 165 Japanese and 61 Swedish hospitals/clinics nationwide participated in the study (210 in Japan and 98 in Sweden were approached). "
8147,1,Data were collected between November 2013 and May 2014 with a questionnaire that was adapted from a previous Dutch study on telemonitoring.
8148,2,"The mean age of the cardiologists and nurses was 47 years and 41 years, respectively. "
8149,2,Experience at the current position caring for HF patients was 19 years among the physicians and 15 years among the nurses. 
8150,2,"In total, 7 Japanese (4.2%) and none of the Swedish health care institutions used telemonitoring. "
8151,2,"One fourth (24.0%, 118/498) of the health care professionals were familiar with the technology (in Japan: 21.6%, 82/378; in Sweden: 30.0%, 36/120). "
8152,2,"The highest expectations of telemonitoring (rated on a scale from 0-10) were reduced hospitalizations (8.3 in Japan and 7.5 in Sweden), increased patient self-care (7.8 and 7.4), and offering high-quality care (7.8 and 7.0). "
8153,2,"The major goal for introducing telemonitoring was to monitor physical condition and recognize signs of worsening HF in Japan (94.1%, 352/374) and Sweden (88.7%, 102/115). "
8154,2,"The following reasons were also high in Sweden: to monitor effects of treatment and adjust it remotely (86.9%, 100/115) and to do remote drug titration (79.1%, 91/115). "
8155,2,"Just under a quarter of Japanese (22.4%, 85/378) and over a third of Swedish (38.1%, 45/118) health care professionals thought that telemonitoring was a good way to follow up stable HF patients. "
8156,2,"Three domains of barriers were identified by content analysis: organizational barriers ""how are we going to do it?"" (categories include structure and resource), health care professionals themselves ""what do we need to know and do"" (reservation), and barriers related to patients ""not everybody would benefit"" (internal and external shortcomings)."
8157,3,Telemonitoring for HF patients has not been implemented in Japan or Sweden. 
8158,3,"However, health care professionals have expectations of telemonitoring to reduce patients' hospitalizations and increase patient self-care. "
8159,3,There are still a wide range of barriers to the implementation of HF telemonitoring.
8160,4,Scientific Versus Experiential Evidence: Discourse Analysis of the Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency Debate in a Multiple Sclerosis Forum
8161,0,"The vascular hypothesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), and its treatment (known as liberation therapy) was immediately rejected by experts but enthusiastically gripped by patients who shared their experiences with other patients worldwide by use of social media, such as patient online forums. "
8162,0,"Contradictions between scientific information and lay experiences may be a source of distress for MS patients, but we do not know how patients perceive and deal with these contradictions."
8163,1,"By using critical discourse analysis, we studied CCSVI-related posts in the patient online forum of the German MS Society in a chronological order from the first post mentioning CCSVI to the time point when saturation was reached. "
8164,1,"For that time period, a total of 117 CCSVI-related threads containing 1907 posts were identified. "
8165,1,"We analyzed the interaction and communication practices of and between individuals, looked for the relation between concrete subtopics to identify more abstract discourse strands, and tried to reveal discourse positions explaining how users took part in the CCSVI discussion."
8166,2,"There was an emotionally charged debate about CCSVI which could be generalized to 2 discourse strands: (1) the ""downfall of the professional knowledge providers"" and (2) the ""rise of the nonprofessional treasure trove of experience."" The discourse strands indicated that the discussion moved away from the question whether scientific or experiential knowledge had more evidentiary value. "
8167,2,"Rather, the question whom to trust (ie, scientists, fellow sufferers, or no one at all) was of fundamental significance. "
8168,2,"Four discourse positions could be identified by arranging them into the dimensions ""trust in evidence-based knowledge,"" ""trust in experience-based knowledge,"" and ""subjectivity"" (ie, the emotional character of contributions manifested by the use of popular rhetoric that seemed to mask a deep personal involvement)."
8169,3,"By critical discourse analysis of the CCSVI discussion in a patient online forum, we reconstruct a lay discourse about the evidentiary value of knowledge. "
8170,3,We detected evidence criteria in this lay discourse that are different from those in the expert discourse. 
8171,3,But we should be cautious to interpret this dissociation as a sign of an intellectual incapability to understand scientific evidence or a naive trust in experiential knowledge. 
8172,3,"Instead, it might be an indication of cognitive dissonance reduction to protect oneself against contradictory information."
8173,4,Medical Student and Tutor Perceptions of Video Versus Text in an Interactive Online Virtual Patient for Problem-Based Learning: A Pilot Study
8174,0,The impact of the use of video resources in primarily paper-based problem-based learning (PBL) settings has been widely explored. 
8175,0,"Although it can provide many benefits, the use of video can also hamper the critical thinking of learners in contexts where learners are developing clinical reasoning. "
8176,0,"However, the use of video has not been explored in the context of interactive virtual patients for PBL."
8177,1,"An existing virtual patient for PBL was adapted for use in video and provided as an intervention to students in the transition year of the undergraduate medicine course at St George's, University of London. "
8178,1,"Survey instruments were used to capture student and PBL tutor experiences and perceptions of the intervention, and a formative review meeting was run with PBL tutors. "
8179,1,Descriptive statistics were generated for the structured responses and a thematic analysis was used to identify emergent themes in the unstructured responses.
8180,2,Analysis of student responses (n=119) and tutor comments (n=18) yielded 8 distinct themes relating to the perceived educational efficacy of information presented in video and text formats in a PBL context. 
8181,2,"Although some students found some characteristics of the videos beneficial, when asked to express a preference for video or text the majority of those that responded to the question (65%, 65/100) expressed a preference for text. "
8182,2,Student responses indicated that the use of video slowed the pace of PBL and impeded students' ability to review and critically appraise the presented information.
8183,3,Our findings suggest that text was perceived to be a better source of information than video in virtual patients for PBL. 
8184,3,"More specifically, the use of video was perceived as beneficial for providing details, visual information, and context where text was unable to do so. "
8185,3,"However, learner acceptance of text was higher in the context of PBL, particularly when targeting clinical reasoning skills. "
8186,3,This pilot study has provided the foundation for further research into the effectiveness of different virtual patient designs for PBL.
8187,4,A Scalable Framework to Detect Personal Health Mentions on Twitter
8188,0,Biomedical research has traditionally been conducted via surveys and the analysis of medical records. 
8189,0,"However, these resources are limited in their content, such that non-traditional domains (eg, online forums and social media) have an opportunity to supplement the view of an individual's health."
8190,1,We collected more than 250 million tweets via the Twitter streaming API over a 2-month period in 2014. 
8191,1,"The corpus was filtered down to approximately 250,000 tweets, stratified across 34 high-impact health issues, based on guidance from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. "
8192,1,"We created a labeled corpus of several thousand tweets via a survey, administered over Amazon Mechanical Turk, that documents when terms correspond to mentions of personal health issues or an alternative (eg, a metaphor). "
8193,1,We engineered a scalable classifier for personal health mentions via feature selection and assessed its potential over the health issues. 
8194,1,We further investigated the utility of the tweets by determining the extent to which Twitter users disclose personal health status.
8195,2,Our investigation yielded several notable findings. 
8196,2,"First, we find that tweets from a small subset of the health issues can train a scalable classifier to detect health mentions. "
8197,2,"Specifically, training on 2000 tweets from four health issues (cancer, depression, hypertension, and leukemia) yielded a classifier with precision of 0.77 on all 34 health issues. "
8198,2,"Second, Twitter users disclosed personal health status for all health issues. "
8199,2,"Notably, personal health status was disclosed over 50% of the time for 11 out of 34 (33%) investigated health issues. "
8200,2,"Third, the disclosure rate was dependent on the health issue in a statistically significant manner (P<.001). "
8201,2,"For instance, more than 80% of the tweets about migraines (83/100) and allergies (85/100) communicated personal health status, while only around 10% of the tweets about obesity (13/100) and heart attack (12/100) did so. "
8202,2,"Fourth, the likelihood that people disclose their own versus other people's health status was dependent on health issue in a statistically significant manner as well (P<.001). "
8203,2,"For example, 69% (69/100) of the insomnia tweets disclosed the author's status, while only 1%(1/100) disclosed another person's status. "
8204,2,"By contrast, 1% (1/100) of the Down syndrome tweets disclosed the author's status, while 21% (21/100) disclosed another person's status."
8205,3,It is possible to automatically detect personal health status mentions on Twitter in a scalable manner. 
8206,3,"These mentions correspond to the health issues of the Twitter users themselves, but also other individuals. "
8207,3,"Though this study did not investigate the veracity of such statements, we anticipate such information may be useful in supplementing traditional health-related sources for research purposes."
8208,4,Virtual Patients on the Semantic Web: A Proof-of-Application Study
8209,0,"Virtual patients are interactive computer simulations that are increasingly used as learning activities in modern health care education, especially in teaching clinical decision making. "
8210,0,A key challenge is how to retrieve and repurpose virtual patients as unique types of educational resources between different platforms because of the lack of standardized content-retrieving and repurposing mechanisms. 
8211,0,"Semantic Web technologies provide the capability, through structured information, for easy retrieval, reuse, repurposing, and exchange of virtual patients between different systems."
8212,1,"A standalone Web distribution and Web interface, which contains an extension for the OpenLabyrinth virtual patient authoring system, was implemented. "
8213,1,"This extension was designed to semantically annotate virtual patients to facilitate intelligent searches, complex queries, and easy exchange between institutions. "
8214,1,The OpenLabyrinth extension enables OpenLabyrinth authors to integrate and share virtual patient case metadata within the mEducator3.0 network. 
8215,1,"Evaluation included 3 successive steps: (1) expert reviews; (2) evaluation of the ability of health care professionals and medical students to create, share, and exchange virtual patients through specific scenarios in extended OpenLabyrinth (OLabX); and (3) evaluation of the repurposed learning objects that emerged from the procedure."
8216,2,We evaluated 30 repurposed virtual patient cases. 
8217,2,"The evaluation, with a total of 98 participants, demonstrated the system's main strength: the core repurposing capacity. "
8218,2,The extensive metadata schema presentation facilitated user exploration and filtering of resources. 
8219,2,Usability weaknesses were primarily related to standard computer applications' ease of use provisions. 
8220,2,Most evaluators provided positive feedback regarding educational experiences on both content and system usability. 
8221,2,Evaluation results replicated across several independent evaluation events.
8222,3,"The OpenLabyrinth extension, as part of the semantic mEducator3.0 approach, is a virtual patient sharing approach that builds on a collection of Semantic Web services and federates existing sources of clinical and educational data. "
8223,3,It is an effective sharing tool for virtual patients and has been merged into the next version of the app (OpenLabyrinth 3.3). 
8224,3,"Such tool extensions may enhance the medical education arsenal with capacities of creating simulation/game-based learning episodes, massive open online courses, curricular transformations, and a future robust infrastructure for enabling mobile learning."
8225,4,Dose-Response Effects of a Web-Based Physical Activity Program on Body Composition and Metabolic Health in Inactive Older Adults: Additional Analyses of a Randomized Controlled Trial
8226,0,Low physical activity is a major risk factor for several age-related diseases. 
8227,0,"Recently, we showed in a randomized controlled trial that a 12-week Web-based intervention (Philips DirectLife) to increase physical activity was effective in increasing physical activity levels and metabolic health in an inactive population aged 60-70 years."
8228,1,"Among the 235 participants in a randomized controlled trial of the Actief en Gezond Oud (AGO) study, we assessed the effects of the intervention on metabolic parameters in those who had successfully reached their personalized physical activity target compared with the entire intervention group. "
8229,1,"Furthermore, we studied the dose-response effect of increase in physical activity on metabolic outcome within the intervention group."
8230,2,"Of the intervention group, 50 of 119 (42.0%) participants successfully reached the physical activity target (corresponding to a 10% increased daily physical activity on average). "
8231,2,"This group showed markedly higher effects of the intervention compared to the entire intervention group, with greater decreases in body weight (2.74 vs 1.49 kg), waist circumference (3.74 vs 2.33 cm), insulin resistance (HOMA index: 0.23 vs 0.20), and in cholesterol/HDL ratio (0.39 vs 0.20) and Framingham risk score (0.90% vs 0.54%). "
8232,2,We found that men compared to women were more likely to be successful. 
8233,2,"The dose-response analysis showed that there was a significant association between increase in minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity and body weight loss, BMI reduction, waist circumference reduction, HDL cholesterol increasing, and cholesterol/HDL ratio lowering."
8234,3,"Of the intervention group, 42.0% (50/119) reached their daily physical activity end goal, which was associated with a markedly better effect on body composition and metabolic health compared to the effect in the entire intervention group. "
8235,3,"In this population, men are more likely to be successful in increasing physical activity. "
8236,3,Findings demonstrate that improving the effect of such physical activity interventions requires finding new ways to increase the proportion of the population reaching the targeted goal.
8237,4,A Medical Consultation Service on Facebook: Descriptive Analysis of Questions Answered
8238,0,Social media is used increasingly by the general public to access health information. 
8239,0,"However, a lack of models for health information distribution limits the presence of publicly funded services on social media sites."
8240,1,A Facebook site was launched for 11 months based on a question-and-answer service produced by a pediatrician and open to Facebook users over 18 years old. 
8241,1,"If the answer did not include a further referral to a health care service provider, the question was considered comprehensively answered. "
8242,1,"The site was funded by a pharmaceutical company, and it included an advertisement of a pharmaceutical product for children's fever and pain."
8243,2,"During the study, 768 questions were submitted: an average of 69.8 (SD 31.7) per month. "
8244,2,"There were 245,533 independent Facebook users on the site, with an average of 727.0 (SD 2280.6) per day. "
8245,2,"Infections were the most common theme in questions (355/768, 46.2%). "
8246,2,"Questions were more likely to be comprehensively answered if they were related to infections (279/355, 78.6%) than questions related to non-infectious symptoms (265/423, 64.2%, P=.003)."
8247,3,"On this site aimed at parents of small children, personalized answers were an effective way of delivering information. "
8248,3,The service is likely to have reduced the need for further contacts with a health care service provider in more than half of the cases. 
8249,3,The site could serve as a model for publicly funded health information distribution.
8250,4,The Management of Acute Adverse Effects of Breast Cancer Treatment in General Practice: A Video-Vignette Study
8251,0,There has been a focus recently on the use of the Internet and email to deliver education interventions to general practitioners (GPs). 
8252,0,"The treatment of breast cancer may include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormone treatment. "
8253,0,These treatments may have acute adverse effects. 
8254,0,GPs need more information on the diagnosis and management of specific adverse effects encountered immediately after cancer treatment.
8255,1,"During phase 1, participants viewed 6 video vignettes of actor-patients reporting 1 of 6 acute symptoms following surgery and chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment. "
8256,1,GPs indicated their diagnosis and proposed management through an online survey program. 
8257,1,"They received feedback about each scenario in the form of a specialist clinic letter, as if the patient had been seen at a specialist clinic after they had attended the GP. "
8258,1,This letter incorporated extracts from local guidelines on the management of the symptoms presented. 
8259,1,This feedback was sent to the GPs electronically on the same survey platform. 
8260,1,"In phase 2, all GPs were invited to manage similar cases as phase 1. "
8261,1,Their proposed management was compared to the guidelines. 
8262,1,"McNemar test was used to compare data from phases 1 and 2, and logistic regression was used to explore the GP characteristics that were associated with inappropriate case management."
8263,2,A total of 50 GPs participated. 
8264,2,Participants were younger and more likely to be female than other GPs in Australia. 
8265,2,"For 5 of 6 vignettes in phase 1, management was consistent with expert opinion in the minority of cases (6%-46%). "
8266,2,Participant demographic characteristics had a variable effect on different management decisions in phase 1. 
8267,2,The variables modeled explained 15%-28% of the differences observed. 
8268,2,"Diagnosis and management improved significantly in phase 2, especially for diarrhea, neutropenia, and seroma sample cases. "
8269,2,The proportion of incorrect management responses was reduced to a minimum (25.3%-49.3%) in phase 2.
8270,3,There was evidence that providing feedback by experts on specific cases had an impact on GPs' knowledge about how to appropriately manage acute treatment adverse effects. 
8271,3,This educational intervention could be targeted to support the implementation of shared care during cancer treatment.
8272,4,A Web-Based Sexual Violence Bystander Intervention for Male College Students: Randomized Controlled Trial
8273,0,Bystander intervention approaches offer promise for reducing rates of sexual violence on college campuses. 
8274,0,"Most interventions are in-person small-group formats, which limit their reach and reduce their overall public health impact."
8275,1,"A random probability sample of 743 male undergraduate students (aged 18 to 24 years) attending a large, urban university located in the southeastern United States was recruited online and randomized to either RealConsent (n=376) or a Web-based general health promotion program (n=367). "
8276,1,"Participants were surveyed online at baseline, postintervention, and 6-months postintervention. "
8277,1,"RealConsent was delivered via a password-protected Web portal that contained six 30-minute media-based and interactive modules covering knowledge of informed consent, communication skills regarding sex, the role of alcohol and male socialization in sexual violence, empathy for rape victims, and bystander education. "
8278,1,Primary outcomes were self-reported prosocial intervening behaviors and sexual violence perpetration. 
8279,1,"Secondary outcomes were theoretical mediators (eg, knowledge, attitudes)."
8280,2,At 6-month follow-up RealConsent participants intervened more often (P=.04) and engaged in less sexual violence perpetration (P=.04) compared to controls. 
8281,2,"In addition, RealConsent participants reported greater legal knowledge of sexual assault (P<.001), greater knowledge of effective consent (P<.001), less rape myths (P<.001), greater empathy for rape victims (P<.001), less negative date rape attitudes (P<.001), less hostility toward women (P=.01), greater intentions to intervene (P=.04), less hyper-gender ideology (P<.001), less positive outcome expectancies for nonconsensual sex (P=.03), more positive outcome expectancies for intervening (P<.001), and less comfort with other men's inappropriate behaviors (P<.001)."
8282,3,Our results support the efficacy of RealConsent. 
8283,3,"Due to its Web-based format, RealConsent has potential for broad-based dissemination thereby increasing its overall public health impact on sexual violence."
8284,4,Long-Term Results of a Web-Based Guided Self-Help Intervention for Employees With Depressive Symptoms: Randomized Controlled Trial
8285,0,Depressive disorders are highly prevalent in the working population and are associated with excessive costs. 
8286,0,The evidence for effective worker-directed interventions for employees with depressive symptoms is limited. 
8287,0,Treating employees with depressive symptoms via the Internet before they report sick from work could be beneficial and cost saving.
8288,1,"A two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a worker-directed, Web-based, guided self-help intervention to care as usual (CAU) was carried out. "
8289,1,We recruited employees from 6 companies via the company's Intranet and by putting up posters. 
8290,1,The inclusion criteria were elevated depressive symptoms as measured by a score >= 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) and not being on sick leave. 
8291,1,The intervention contained 6 lessons and consisted of problem-solving treatment and cognitive therapy. 
8292,1,Participants were asked to submit weekly assignments via the website after completion of a lesson and they received feedback from a coach via the website. 
8293,1,"Self-report questionnaires on depressive symptoms (CES-D; primary outcome), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI), work performance (Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, HPQ), duration of absenteeism, and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS; secondary outcomes), were completed at baseline, posttreatment, and at 6-, and 12-month follow-up. "
8294,1,Several subgroup and per-protocol analyses were performed.
8295,2,A total of 231 employees were randomized to either the intervention group (n=116) or to CAU (n=115). 
8296,2,Completion of assessments varied between 54%-74%. 
8297,2,Improvement in depressive symptoms between baseline and posttreatment was shown in all participants and these effects sustained over time. 
8298,2,"However, there were no differences between the 2 groups (adjusted regression coefficient=0.46, 95% CI -2.11 to 3.03, P=.72; Cohen's d=0.05). "
8299,2,Differences between groups were also not significant for the secondary outcomes. 
8300,2,"No subgroups were identified to show differences between the groups, nor did we find a between-group effect in the per-protocol analyses."
8301,3,"This study showed that a worker-directed, Web-based, guided self-help intervention was not more effective than CAU in reducing depressive symptoms among employees with depressive symptoms who were not on sick leave over the period of 1 year. "
8302,3,An intervention for this specific target group might not be necessary because the recovery in the CAU group was comparable to the intervention group and sustained over a 12-month period.
8303,4,Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of eHealth Interventions in Somatic Diseases: A Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
8304,0,eHealth potentially enhances quality of care and may reduce health care costs. 
8305,0,"However, a review of systematic reviews published in 2010 concluded that high-quality evidence on the benefits of eHealth interventions was still lacking."
8306,1,"Literature searches were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and Scopus for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on eHealth interventions published between August 2009 and December 2012. "
8307,1,Articles were screened for relevance based on preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
8308,1,Citations of residual articles were screened for additional literature. 
8309,1,Included papers were critically appraised using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement before data were extracted. 
8310,1,"Based on conclusions drawn by the authors of the included articles, reviews and meta-analyses were divided into 1 of 3 groups: suitable, promising, or limited evidence on effectiveness/cost-effectiveness. "
8311,1,Cases of uncertainty were resolved by consensus discussion. 
8312,1,Effect sizes were extracted from papers that included a meta-analysis. 
8313,1,"To compare our results with previous findings, a trend analysis was performed."
8314,2,"Our literature searches yielded 31 eligible reviews, of which 20 (65%) reported on costs. "
8315,2,"Seven papers (23%) concluded that eHealth is effective/cost-effective, 13 (42%) underlined that evidence is promising, and others found limited or inconsistent proof. "
8316,2,Methodological quality of the included reviews and meta-analyses was generally considered high. 
8317,2,Trend analysis showed a considerable accumulation of literature on eHealth. 
8318,2,"However, a similar percentage of papers concluded that eHealth is effective/cost-effective or evidence is at least promising (65% vs 62%). "
8319,2,Reviews focusing primarily on children or family caregivers still remained scarce. 
8320,2,"Although a pooled (subgroup) analysis of aggregate data from randomized studies was performed in a higher percentage of more recently published reviews (45% vs 27%), data on economic outcome measures were less frequently reported (65% vs 85%)."
8321,3,The number of reviews and meta-analyses on eHealth interventions in patients with somatic diseases has increased considerably in recent years. 
8322,3,"Most articles show eHealth is effective/cost-effective or at least suggest evidence is promising, which is consistent with previous findings. "
8323,3,"Although many researchers advocate larger, well-designed, controlled studies, we believe attention should be given to the development and evaluation of strategies to implement effective/cost-effective eHealth initiatives in daily practice, rather than to further strengthen current evidence."
8324,4,Economic Evaluation of a Web-Based Tailored Lifestyle Intervention for Adults: Findings Regarding Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Utility From a Randomized Controlled Trial
8325,0,"Different studies have reported the effectiveness of Web-based computer-tailored lifestyle interventions, but economic evaluations of these interventions are scarce."
8326,1,"The economic evaluation, conducted from a societal perspective, was part of a 2-year randomized controlled trial including 3 study groups. "
8327,1,"All groups received personalized health risk appraisals based on the guidelines for physical activity, fruit intake, vegetable intake, alcohol consumption, and smoking. "
8328,1,"Additionally, respondents in the sequential condition received personal advice about one lifestyle behavior in the first year and a second behavior in the second year; respondents in the simultaneous condition received personal advice about all unhealthy behaviors in both years. "
8329,1,"During a period of 24 months, health care use, medication use, absenteeism from work, and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed every 3 months using Web-based questionnaires. "
8330,1,"Demographics were assessed at baseline, and lifestyle behaviors were assessed at both baseline and after 24 months. "
8331,1,"Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed based on the outcome measures lifestyle factor (the number of guidelines respondents adhered to) and quality of life, respectively. "
8332,1,We accounted for uncertainty by using bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity analyses.
8333,2,A total of 1733 respondents were included in the analyses. 
8334,2,"From a willingness to pay of epsilon 4594 per additional guideline met, the sequential intervention (n=552) was likely to be the most cost-effective, whereas from a willingness to pay of _ 10,850, the simultaneous intervention (n=517) was likely to be most cost-effective. "
8335,2,The control condition (n=664) appeared to be preferred with regard to quality of life.
8336,3,"Both the sequential and the simultaneous lifestyle interventions were likely to be cost-effective when it concerned the lifestyle factor, whereas the control condition was when it concerned quality of life. "
8337,3,"However, there is no accepted cutoff point for the willingness to pay per gain in lifestyle behaviors, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions. "
8338,3,Further economic evaluations of lifestyle interventions are needed.
8339,4,Virtual Patients in Primary Care: Developing a Reusable Model That Fosters Reflective Practice and Clinical Reasoning
8340,0,"Primary care is an integral part of the medical curriculum at Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. "
8341,0,It is present at every stage of the students' education. 
8342,0,"Virtual patients (VPs) may support learning processes and be a valuable complement in teaching communication skills, patient-centeredness, clinical reasoning, and reflective thinking. "
8343,0,Current literature on virtual patients lacks reports on how to design and use virtual patients with a primary care perspective.
8344,1,The VP model was developed using the Open Tufts University Sciences Knowledgebase (OpenTUSK) virtual patient system as a prototyping tool. 
8345,1,Both the VP model and the case created using the developed model were validated by a group of 10 experienced primary care physicians and then further improved by a work group of faculty involved in the medical program. 
8346,1,The students' opinions on the VP were investigated through focus group interviews with 14 students and the results analyzed using content analysis.
8347,2,"The VP primary care model was based on a patient-centered model of consultation modified according to the Calgary-Cambridge Guides, and the learning outcomes of the study program in medicine were taken into account. "
8348,2,The VP primary care model is based on Kolb's learning theories and consists of several learning cycles. 
8349,2,"Each learning cycle includes a didactic inventory and then provides the student with a concrete experience (video, pictures, and other material) and preformulated feedback. "
8350,2,The students' learning process was visualized by requiring the students to expose their clinical reasoning and reflections in-action in every learning cycle. 
8351,2,Content analysis of the focus group interviews showed good acceptance of the model by students. 
8352,2,"The VP was regarded as an intermediate learning activity and a complement to both the theoretical and the clinical part of the education, filling out gaps in clinical knowledge. "
8353,2,The content of the VP case was regarded as authentic and the students appreciated the immediate feedback. 
8354,2,The students found the structure of the model interactive and easy to follow. 
8355,2,The students also reported that the VP case supported their self-directed learning and reflective ability.
8356,3,"We have built a new VP model for primary care with embedded communication training and iterated learning cycles that in pilot testing showed good acceptance by students, supporting their self-directed learning and reflective thinking."
8357,4,Can Anonymous Posters on Medical Forums be Reidentified?
8358,0,Participants in medical forums often reveal personal health information about themselves in their online postings. 
8359,0,"To feel comfortable revealing sensitive personal health information, some participants may hide their identity by posting anonymously. "
8360,0,"They can do this by using fake identities, nicknames, or pseudonyms that cannot readily be traced back to them. "
8361,0,"However, individual writing styles have unique features and it may be possible to determine the true identity of an anonymous user through author attribution analysis. "
8362,0,"Although there has been previous work on the authorship attribution problem, there has been a dearth of research on automated authorship attribution on medical forums. "
8363,0,The focus of the paper is to demonstrate that character-based author attribution works better than word-based methods in medical forums.
8364,1,The messages were labeled by nicknames of the forum participants. 
8365,1,We evaluated the system's performance through its accuracy on 6000 messages gathered from 2 medical forums on an in vitro fertilization (IVF) support website.
8366,2,"Given 2 lists of candidate authors (30 and 50 candidates, respectively), we obtained an F score accuracy in detecting authors of 75% to 80% on messages containing 100 to 150 words on average, and 97.9% on longer messages containing at least 300 words."
8367,3,Authorship can be successfully detected in short free-form messages posted on medical forums. 
8368,3,This raises a concern about the meaningfulness of anonymous posting on such medical forums. 
8369,3,Authorship attribution tools can be used to warn consumers wishing to post anonymously about the likelihood of their identity being determined.
8370,4,Use of a Web 2.0 Portal to Improve Education and Communication in Young Patients With Families: Randomized Controlled Trial
8371,0,"Diabetes requires extensive self-care and comprehensive knowledge, making patient education central to diabetes self-management. "
8372,0,Web 2.0 systems have great potential to enhance health information and open new ways for patients and practitioners to communicate.
8373,1,"A Web 2.0 portal was developed in collaboration with patients, parents, and practitioners. "
8374,1,"It offered communication with local practitioners, interaction with peers, and access to relevant information and services. "
8375,1,Children and adolescents with diabetes in a geographic population of two pediatric clinics in Sweden were randomized to a group receiving passwords for access to the portal or a control group with no access (n=230) for 1 year. 
8376,1,All subjects had access during a second study year. 
8377,1,Users' activity was logged by site and page visits. 
8378,1,"Health-related quality of life (HRQOL), empowerment (DES), and quality of information (QPP) questionnaires were given at baseline and after 1 and 2 study years. "
8379,1,Clinical data came from the Swedish pediatric diabetes quality registry SWEDIABKIDS.
8380,2,"There was a continuous flow of site visits, decreasing in summer and Christmas periods. "
8381,2,"In 119/233 families (51%), someone visited the portal the first study year and 169/484 (35%) the second study year. "
8382,2,The outcome variables did not differ between intervention and control group. 
8383,2,No adverse treatment or self-care effects were identified. 
8384,2,A higher proportion of mothers compared to fathers visited once or more the first year (P<.001) and the second year (P<.001). 
8385,2,"The patients who had someone in the family visiting the portal 5 times or more, had shorter diabetes duration (P=.006), were younger (P=.008), had lower HbA1c after 1 year of access (P=.010), and were more often girls (P<.001). "
8386,2,Peer interaction seems to be a valued aspect.
8387,3,The Web 2.0 portal may be useful as a complement to traditional care for this target group. 
8388,3,Widespread use of a portal would need integration in routine care and promotion by diabetes team members.
8389,4,"Use of Twitter Among Local Health Departments: An Analysis of Information Sharing, Engagement, and Action"
8390,0,Social media offers unprecedented opportunities for public health to engage audiences in conversations and collaboration that could potentially lead to improved health conditions. 
8391,0,"While there is some evidence that local health departments (LHDs) are using social media and Twitter in particular, little is known about how Twitter is used by LHDs and how they use it to engage followers versus disseminating one-way information."
8392,1,"The Twitter accounts for 210 LHDs were stratified into three groups based on size of population served (n=69 for less than 100,000; n=89 for 100,000-499,999; n=52 for 500,000 or greater). "
8393,1,A sample of 1000 tweets was obtained for each stratum and coded as being either about the organization or about personal-health topics. 
8394,1,"Subcategories for organization included information, engagement, and action. "
8395,1,Subcategories for personal health included information and action.
8396,2,"Of all LHD tweets (n=3000), 56.1% (1682/3000) related to personal health compared with 39.5% (1186/3000) that were about the organization. "
8397,2,"Of the personal-health tweets, 58.5% (984/1682) involved factual information and 41.4% (697/1682) encouraged action. "
8398,2,"Of the organization-related tweets, 51.9% (615/1186) represented one-way communication about the organization and its events and services, 35.0% (416/1186) tried to engage followers in conversation, and 13.3% (158/1186) encouraged action to benefit the organization (eg, attend events). "
8399,2,"Compared with large LHDs, small LHDs were more likely to post tweets about their organization (Cramer's V=0.06) but were less likely to acknowledge events and accomplishments of other organizations (chi(2)=12.83, P=.02, Cramer's V=0.18). "
8400,2,Small LHDs were also less likely to post personal health-related tweets (Cramer's V=0.08) and were less likely to post tweets containing suggestions to take action to modify their lifestyle. 
8401,2,"While large LHDs were more likely to post engagement-related tweets about the organization (Cramer's V=0.12), they were less likely to ask followers to take action that would benefit the organization (chi(2)=7.59, P=.02. "
8402,2,Cramer's V=0.08). 
8403,2,"While certain associations were statistically significant, the Cramer's V statistic revealed weak associations."
8404,3,"Twitter is being adopted by LHDs, but its primary use involves one-way communication on personal-health topics as well as organization-related information. "
8405,3,There is also evidence that LHDs are starting to use Twitter to engage their audiences in conversations. 
8406,3,"As public health transitions to more dialogic conversation and engagement, Twitter's potential to help form partnerships with audiences and involve them as program participants may lead to action for improved health."
8407,4,Two Fully Automated Web-Based Interventions for Risky Alcohol Use: Randomized Controlled Trial
8408,0,"Excessive alcohol use is a widespread problem in many countries, especially among young people. "
8409,0,"To reach more people engaging in high-risk drinking behaviors, a number of online programs have been developed in recent years. "
8410,0,"Change Your Drinking is a German, diary-based, fully automated alcohol intervention. "
8411,0,"In 2010, a revised version of the program was developed. "
8412,0,"It is more strongly oriented to concepts of relapse prevention than the previous version, includes more feedback, and offers more possibilities to interact with the program. "
8413,0,"Moreover, the program duration was extended from 10 to 14 days."
8414,1,"The effectiveness of both program versions was compared in a Web-based, open, randomized controlled trial with follow-up surveys 6 weeks and 3 months after registration. "
8415,1,Participants were recruited online and were randomly assigned to either the original or the revised version of Change Your Drinking. 
8416,1,"The following self-assessed outcomes were used: alcohol use days, alcohol intake in grams, the occurrence of binge drinking and risky drinking (all referring to the past 7 days prior to each survey), and the number of alcohol-related problems."
8417,2,A total of 595 participants were included in the trial. 
8418,2,Follow-up rates were 58.0% after 6 weeks and 49.6% after 3 months. 
8419,2,No significant group differences were found in any of the outcomes. 
8420,2,"However, the revised version was used by more participants (80.7%) than the original version (55.7%). "
8421,2,A significant time effect was detected in all outcomes (alcohol use days: P=.002; alcohol intake in grams: P<.001; binge drinking: P<.001; alcohol-related problems: P=.004; risky drinking: P<.001).
8422,3,The duration and complexity of the program played a minor role in reducing alcohol consumption. 
8423,3,"However, differences in program usage between the versions suggest the revised version was more attractive to participants."
8424,4,Accessing Suicide-Related Information on the Internet: A Retrospective Observational Study of Search Behavior
8425,0,The Internet's potential impact on suicide is of major public health interest as easy online access to pro-suicide information or specific suicide methods may increase suicide risk among vulnerable Internet users. 
8426,0,"Little is known, however, about users' actual searching and browsing behaviors of online suicide-related information."
8427,1,A retrospective observational study was done. 
8428,1,We used a web search dataset released by America Online (AOL). 
8429,1,"The dataset was randomly sampled from all AOL subscribers' web queries between March and May 2006 and generated by 657,000 service subscribers."
8430,2,"We found 5526 search queries (0.026%, 5526/21,000,000) that included the keyword ""suicide"". "
8431,2,"The 5526 search queries included 1586 different search terms and were generated by 1625 unique subscribers (0.25%, 1625/657,000). "
8432,2,"Of these queries, 61.38% (3392/5526) were followed by users clicking on a search result. "
8433,2,"Of these 3392 queries, 1344 (39.62%) webpages were clicked on by 930 unique users but only 1314 of those webpages were accessible during the study period. "
8434,2,Each clicked-through webpage was classified into 11 categories. 
8435,2,"The categories of the most visited webpages were: entertainment (30.13%; 396/1314), scientific information (18.31%; 240/1314), and community resources (14.53%; 191/1314). "
8436,2,"Among the 1314 accessed webpages, we could identify only two pro-suicide websites. "
8437,2,"We found that the search terms used to access these sites included ""commiting suicide with a gas oven"", ""hairless goat"", ""pictures of murder by strangulation"", and ""photo of a severe burn"". "
8438,2,A limitation of our study is that the database may be dated and confined to mainly English webpages.
8439,3,"Searching or browsing suicide-related or pro-suicide webpages was uncommon, although a small group of users did access websites that contain detailed suicide method information. "
8440,4,Acceptance of Internet-Based Health Care Services Among Households in Poland: Secondary Analysis of a Population-Based Survey
8441,0,"Polish society is benefiting from growing access to the Internet, but the use of advanced e-services is still limited. "
8442,0,"The provision of Internet-based health services depends not only on the penetration of the Internet into society, but also on the acceptance of this technology by potential users."
8443,1,The study was based on a secondary analysis of the dataset from the 2011 Social Diagnosis survey (a biannual survey conducted since 2001 about economic and non-economic aspects of household and individual living conditions in Poland). 
8444,1,Analysis of the questionnaire results focused on the situations of the households included in the study. 
8445,1,"The predictors for 2 outcome variables describing the acceptance of households for Internet use for provision of a full health care service, or at least access to information and download of required forms, were assessed using multivariate logistic regression."
8446,2,"After excluding those households that would not consider the use of health care services or for which predictor variables assumed missing values, the final analyses were conducted on data from 8915 households. "
8447,2,"Acceptance of the use of the Internet for provision of full health care services in Polish households was significantly higher among households in urban locations with >= 200,000 inhabitants than among households in rural areas; it was also higher with salaried employment as the source of income than with self-employment in agriculture (odds ratio [OR] = 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 - 0.70), retirement pension (OR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.39 - 0.54), disability pension (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 - 0.68), or with several simultaneous income sources (OR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.57 - 0.79). "
8448,2,"Furthermore, acceptance of Internet-based health care was higher in households with a higher monthly net income per capita (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.75 - 2.53 for households from the lowest and the highest income interval), among households with > 1 child aged < 15 years (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.20 - 1.59), among households with at least some books (with OR = 3.33, 95% CI 2.39 - 4.64 for household with no books and those with over 500 books). "
8449,2,"Acceptance was also higher in households with a computer (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.35 - 2.56), Internet access (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.37 - 2.76), and Internet access for a longer duration (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.75 and OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.40 - 2.33 for households with access < 1 year versus those with access for 1-5 years and > 5 years, respectively). "
8450,2,"Greater self-declared confidence in using technology was also associated with higher acceptance of the Internet for health care services (OR = 2.94, 95% CI 2.21 - 3.91 for the least confident households versus those with the highest confidence). "
8451,2,"Furthermore, recent use of health care services increased acceptance of using the Internet for at least some health-related services (OR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.16 - 1.91), but not for full provision of online health care services (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.92 - 1.55). "
8452,2,Neither the hospitalization of a member of a household nor the opinion about satisfying health care needs of a household affected the degree of acceptance.
8453,3,"The acceptance of health care services through the Internet is higher in households from larger cities, with stable income from an employee salary, as well as with higher income levels per capita. "
8454,3,"Furthermore, general computer and Internet use in the household influenced the perception of eHealth. "
8455,3,"Paradoxically, the use of health care services or the level of satisfaction with the coverage of the household's health needs has a limited influence on acceptance of Internet-based health care services. "
8456,4,To Use or Not to Use - Practitioners Perceptions of an Open Web Portal for Young Patients With Diabetes
8457,0,"Health care professionals' attitudes can be a significant factor in their acceptance and efficient use of information technology, so they need to have more knowledge about this resource to enhance their participation."
8458,1,Eighteen professionals who were on pediatric diabetes care teams each wrote an essay on their experience using the portal. 
8459,1,"For their essays, they were asked to describe two situations, focusing on positive and negative user experiences. "
8460,1,The essays were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
8461,2,"Based on our analysis of the respondents essays, we identified three categories that describe perceptions of the Web portal. "
8462,2,The first category - to use or not to use -included the different perspectives of the practioners; those who questioned the benefits of using the Web portal or showed some resistance to using it. 
8463,2,The frequency of use among the practitioners varied greatly. 
8464,2,"Some practitioners never used it, while others used it on a daily basis and regularly promoted it to their patients. "
8465,2,Some respondents in this category reflected on the benefits of contributing actively to online dialogues. 
8466,2,In the second category information center for everyone -practitioners embraced the site as a resource for scientifically sound information and advice. 
8467,2,"As part of their practice, and as a complement to traditional care, practitioners in this category described sending information through the portal to patients and their significant others. "
8468,2,Practitioners felt safe recommending the site because they knew that the information provided was generated by other practitioners. 
8469,2,They also assumed that their patients benefited from actively using the Web portal at home: peers brought the site to life by exchanging experiences through the discussion forums. 
8470,2,"In the third category - developing our practice - practitioners reflected upon the types of information that should be given to patients and how to give it (ie, during in-person appointments or through the Web portal). "
8471,2,They perceived meeting with various professionals at other hospitals to update information on the portal and develop content policies as constructive teamwork. 
8472,2,Practitioners expressed interest in reading patients' dialogues online to learn more about their views. 
8473,2,"They also thought about how they could use the portal to adapt more to patients' needs (eg, creating functions so patients could chat with the diabetes nurses and doctors)."
8474,3,Practitioners expressed positive perceptions toward a tailored open Web portal. 
8475,3,"They suggested that future benefits could be derived from systems that integrate factual information and online dialogues between practitioners and patients (ie, exchanging information for everyone's benefit). "
8476,4,Development and Implementation of a Web-Enabled 3D Consultation Tool for Breast Augmentation Surgery Based on 3D-Image Reconstruction of 2D Pictures
8477,0,"Producing a rich, personalized Web-based consultation tool for plastic surgeons and patients is challenging."
8478,1,"The proposed system uses well-established 2D digital photos for reconstruction into a 3D torso, which is then available to the user for interactive planning. "
8479,1,"The simulation is performed on dedicated servers, accessible via Internet. "
8480,1,"It allows the surgeon, together with the patient, to previsualize the impact of the proposed breast augmentation directly during the consultation before a surgery is decided upon. "
8481,1,We retrospectively conduced a quality control assessment of available anonymized pre- and postoperative 2D digital photographs of patients undergoing breast augmentation procedures. 
8482,1,The method presented above was used to reconstruct 3D pictures from 2D digital pictures. 
8483,1,We used a laser scanner capable of generating a highly accurate surface model of the patient's anatomy to acquire ground truth data. 
8484,1,The quality of the computed 3D reconstructions was compared with the ground truth data used to perform both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
8485,2,"We evaluated the system on 11 clinical cases for surface reconstructions and 4 clinical cases of postoperative simulations, using laser surface scan technologies showing a mean reconstruction error between 2 and 4 mm and a maximum outlier error of 16 mm. "
8486,2,Qualitative and quantitative analyses from plastic surgeons demonstrate the potential of these new emerging technologies.
8487,3,"We tested our tool for 3D, Web-based, patient-specific consultation in the clinical scenario of breast augmentation. "
8488,3,"This example shows that the current state of development allows for creation of responsive and effective Web-based, 3D medical tools, even with highly complex and time-consuming computation, by off-loading them to a dedicated high-performance data center. "
8489,3,"The efficient combination of advanced technologies, based on analysis and understanding of human anatomy and physiology, will allow the development of further Web-based reconstruction and predictive interfaces at different scales of the human body. "
8490,3,The consultation tool presented herein exemplifies the potential of combining advancements in the core areas of computer science and biomedical engineering with the evolving areas of Web technologies. 
8491,3,We are confident that future developments based on a multidisciplinary approach will further pave the way toward personalized Web-enabled medicine.
8492,4,Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Health Care Systems for Alcohol Use Disorders: How Implementation of eHealth Interventions Improves Cost-Effectiveness
8493,0,"Informing policy decisions about the cost-effectiveness of health care systems (ie, packages of clinical interventions) is probably best done using a modeling approach. "
8494,0,"To this end, an alcohol model (ALCMOD) was developed."
8495,0,"PatientsLikeMe is an online quantitative personal research platform for patients with life-changing illnesses to share their experience using patient-reported outcomes, find other patients like them matched on demographic and clinical characteristics, and learn from the aggregated data reports of others to improve their outcomes. "
8496,0,"The goal of the website is to help patients answer the question: ""Given my status, what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?"""
8497,1,"Almost 7,000 members from six PatientsLikeMe communities (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], Multiple Sclerosis [MS], Parkinson's Disease, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], fibromyalgia, and mood disorders) were sent a survey invitation using an internal survey tool (PatientsLikeMe Lens)."
8498,2,Complete responses were received from 1323 participants (19% of invited members). 
8499,2,Between-group demographics varied according to disease community. 
8500,2,"Users perceived the greatest benefit in learning about a symptom they had experienced; 72% (952 of 1323) rated the site ""moderately"" or ""very helpful."" Patients also found the site helpful for understanding the side effects of their treatments (n = 757, 57%). "
8501,2,"Nearly half of patients (n = 559, 42%) agreed that the site had helped them find another patient who had helped them understand what it was like to take a specific treatment for their condition. "
8502,2,"More patients found the site helpful with decisions to start a medication (n = 496, 37%) than to change a medication (n = 359, 27%), change a dosage (n = 336, 25%), or stop a medication (n = 290, 22%). "
8503,2,"Almost all participants (n = 1,249, 94%) were diagnosed when they joined the site. "
8504,2,"Most (n = 824, 62%) experienced no change in their confidence in that diagnosis or had an increased level of confidence (n = 456, 34%). "
8505,2,Use of the site was associated with increasing levels of comfort in sharing personal health information among those who had initially been uncomfortable. 
8506,2,"Overall, 12% of patients (n = 151 of 1320) changed their physician as a result of using the site; this figure was doubled in patients with fibromyalgia (21%, n = 33 of 150). "
8507,2,Patients reported community-specific benefits: 41% of HIV patients (n = 72 of 177) agreed they had reduced risky behaviors and 22% of mood disorders patients (n = 31 of 141) agreed they needed less inpatient care as a result of using the site. 
8508,2,"Analysis of the Web access logs showed that participants who used more features of the site (eg, posted in the online forum) perceived greater benefit."
8509,3,"We have established that members of the community reported a range of benefits, and that these may be related to the extent of site use. "
8510,3,Third party validation and longitudinal evaluation is an important next step in continuing to evaluate the potential of online data-sharing platforms.
8511,1,We conducted a computerized search of the databases indexed by ISI Web of Knowledge (including BIOSIS Previews and Medline) between 2000 and 2008. 
8512,1,"Studies were included if (1) the primary components of the intervention were delivered via the Internet, (2) participants were randomly assigned to conditions, and (3) a measure of behavior related to health was taken after the intervention."
8513,2,"We found 85 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria, providing a total sample size of 43,236 participants. "
8514,2,"On average, interventions had a statistically small but significant effect on health-related behavior (d(+) = 0.16, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.23). "
8515,2,"More extensive use of theory was associated with increases in effect size (P = .049), and, in particular, interventions based on the theory of planned behavior tended to have substantial effects on behavior (d(+) = 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.56). "
8516,2,Interventions that incorporated more behavior change techniques also tended to have larger effects compared to interventions that incorporated fewer techniques (P < .001). 
8517,2,"Finally, the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions was enhanced by the use of additional methods of communicating with participants, especially the use of short message service (SMS), or text, messages."
8518,3,"The review provides a framework for the development of a science of Internet-based interventions, and our findings provide a rationale for investing in more intensive theory-based interventions that incorporate multiple behavior change techniques and modes of delivery."
8519,4,"Phone and Web-Based Tobacco Cessation Treatment: Real-World Utilization Patterns and Outcomes for 11,000 Tobacco Users"
8520,0,Phone-based tobacco cessation programs have been proven effective and widely adopted. 
8521,0,"Web-based solutions exist; however, the evidence base is not yet well established. "
8522,0,"Many cessation treatments are commercially available, but few integrate the phone and Web for delivery and no published studies exist for integrated programs."
8523,1,"We tracked program utilization (calls completed, Web log-ins), quit status, satisfaction, and demographics of 11,143 participants who enrolled in the Free & Clear Quit For Life Program between May 2006 and October 2007. "
8524,1,"All participants received up to five proactive phone counseling sessions with Quit Coaches, unlimited access to an interactive website, up to 20 tailored emails, printed Quit Guides, and cessation medication information. "
8525,1,The program was designed to encourage use of all program components rather than asking participants to choose which components they wanted to use while quitting.
8526,2,We found that participants tended to use phone services more than Web services. 
8527,2,"On average, participants completed 2-2.5 counseling calls and logged in to the online program 1-2 times. "
8528,2,Women were more adherent to the overall program; women utilized Web and phone services significantly (P = .003) more than men. 
8529,2,Older smokers (> 26 years) and moderate smokers (15-20 cigarettes/day) utilized services more (P < .001) than younger (< 26 years) and light or heavy smokers. 
8530,2,Satisfaction with services was high (92% to 95%) and varied somewhat with Web utilization. 
8531,2,Thirty-day quit rates at the 6-month follow-up were 41% using responder analysis and 21% using intent-to-treat analysis. 
8532,2,Web utilization was significantly associated with increased call completion and tobacco abstinence rates at the 6-month follow-up evaluation.
8533,3,"This paper expands our understanding of a real-world treatment program combining two mediums, phone and Web. "
8534,3,"Greater adherence to the program, as defined by using both the phone and Web components, is associated with higher quit rates. "
8535,3,This study has implications for reaching and treating tobacco users with an integrated phone/Web program and offers evidence regarding the effectiveness of integrated cessation programs.
8536,1,Interviews and a focus group were conducted with the development team to discover the factors that positively and negatively affected the development process.
8537,2,Motivating factors included team attributes such as strong leadership and judicious use of medical students and faculty volunteers as developers. 
8538,2,Other motivators included a growing lack of instructional equivalency across diverse clinical teaching sites and financial and resource support by the Faculty of Medicine. 
8539,2,"Barriers to development included an administrative environment that did not yet fully incorporate information technology into its teaching vision and framework, a lack of academic incentive for faculty participation, and inadequate technical support, space, and equipment."
8540,3,"The success of electronic educational resources such as the ASCM I website has caused a significant cultural shift within the Faculty of Medicine, resulting in the provision of more space, resources, and support for IT endeavours in the undergraduate medical curriculum."
8541,4,Improving physician performance through Internet-based interventions: Who will participate?
8542,0,"The availability of Internet-based continuing medical education is rapidly increasing, but little is known about recruitment of physicians to these interventions."
8543,1,"Eligibility was based on administrative claims data, and eligible physicians received recruitment letters via fax and/or courier. "
8544,1,Recruited offices had at least one physician who agreed to participate in the study by providing an email address. 
8545,1,"After one physician from an office was recruited, intensive recruitment of that office ceased. "
8546,1,Email messages reminded individual physicians to participate by logging on to the Internet site.
8547,2,"Of the eligible offices, 325 (33.2%) were recruited, from which 207 physicians (52.8%) participated. "
8548,2,"Recruited versus nonrecruited offices had more eligible patients (mean number of eligible patients per office: 44.1 vs 33.6; P < .001), more eligible physicians (mean number of eligible physicians per office: 6.2 vs 4.1; P < .001), and fewer doctors of osteopathy (mean percent of eligible physicians per office who were doctors of osteopathy: 20.5% vs 26.4%; P = .02). "
8549,2,Multivariable analysis revealed that the odds of recruiting at least one physician from an office were greater if the office had more eligible patients and more eligible physicians. 
8550,2,More participating versus nonparticipating physicians were female (mean percent of female recruited physicians: 39.1% vs 27.0%; P = .01); fewer participating physicians were doctors of osteopathy (mean percent of recruited physicians who were doctors of osteopathy: 15.5% vs 23.9%; P = .04) or international medical graduates (mean percent of recruited physicians who were international graduates: 12.3% vs 23.8%; P = .003). 
8551,2,Multivariable analysis revealed that the odds of a physician participating were greater if the physician was older than 55 years (OR = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.09-4.93) and was from an office with a higher Chlamydia screening rate in the upper tertile (OR = 2.26; 95% CI = 1.23-4.16).
8552,3,Physician participation in an Internet continuing medical education intervention varied significantly by physician and office characteristics.
8553,4,"Health attitudes, health cognitions, and health behaviors among Internet health information seekers: Population-based survey"
8554,0,"Using a functional theory of media use, this paper examines the process of health-information seeking in different domains of Internet use."
8555,1,"The Porter Novelli HealthStyles database, collected annually since 1995, is based on the results of nationally representative postal mail surveys. "
8556,1,"In 1999, 2636 respondents provided usable data for the HealthStyles database. "
8557,1,Independent sample t-tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted.
8558,2,The results showed that individuals who searched for health information on the Internet were indeed more likely to be health-oriented than those who did not. 
8559,2,"Consumers who sought out medical information on the Internet reported higher levels of health-information orientation and healthy activities, as well as stronger health beliefs than those who did not search for medical news on the Internet. "
8560,2,It was observed that those who reported searching for information about drugs and medications on the Internet held stronger health beliefs than the non-searchers. 
8561,2,Comparison of individuals who reported seeking out information about specific diseases on the Internet with individuals who did not showed those who sought out disease-specific information on the Internet to be more health-oriented. 
8562,2,"Finally, consumers who sought out healthy lifestyle information on the Internet were more health conscious and more health-information oriented than those who did not. "
8563,2,They were also more likely to hold stronger health-oriented beliefs and to engage in healthy activities.
8564,3,The results support the functional theory of Internet use. 
8565,3,Internet searchers who used the Internet for a wide range of health purposes were typically more health oriented than non-searchers.
8566,4,Web content accessibility of consumer health information web sites for people with disabilities: A cross sectional evaluation
8567,0,The World Wide Web (WWW) has become an increasingly essential resource for health information consumers. 
8568,0,"The ability to obtain accurate medical information online quickly, conveniently and privately provides health consumers with the opportunity to make informed decisions and participate actively in their personal care. "
8569,0,"Little is known, however, about whether the content of this online health information is equally accessible to people with disabilities who must rely on special devices or technologies to process online information due to their visual, hearing, mobility, or cognitive limitations."
8570,1,We carried out a cross-sectional study of the state of accessibility of health information Web sites to people with disabilities. 
8571,1,We selected 108 consumer health information Web sites from the directory service of a Web search engine. 
8572,1,A measurement framework was constructed to automatically measure the level of Web Accessibility Barriers (WAB) of Web sites following Web accessibility specifications. 
8573,1,"We investigated whether there was a difference between WAB scores across various functional categories of the Web sites, and also evaluated the correlation between the WAB and Alexa traffic rank and Google Page Rank of the Web sites."
8574,2,"We found that none of the Web sites we looked at are completely accessible to people with disabilities, i.e., there were no sites that had no violation of Web accessibility rules. "
8575,2,"However, governmental and educational health information Web sites do exhibit better Web accessibility than the other categories of Web sites (P < 0.001). "
8576,2,"We also found that the correlation between the WAB score and the popularity of a Web site is statistically significant (r = 0.28, P < 0.05), although there is no correlation between the WAB score and the importance of the Web sites (r = 0.15, P = 0.111)."
8577,3,"Evaluation of health information Web sites shows that no Web site scrupulously abides by Web accessibility specifications, even for entities mandated under relevant laws and regulations. "
8578,3,Government and education Web sites show better performance than Web sites among other categories. 
8579,3,Accessibility of a Web site may have a positive impact on its popularity in general. 
8580,3,"However, the Web accessibility of a Web site may not have a significant relationship with its importance on the Web."
8581,4,Online consumer surveys as a methodology for assessing the quality of the United States health care system
8582,0,Interest in monitoring the quality of health care in the United States has increased in recent years. 
8583,0,"However, the policy objectives associated with collecting this information are constrained by the limited availability of timely and relevant data at a reasonable cost. "
8584,0,"Online data-collection technologies hold the promise of gathering data directly and inexpensively from large, representative samples of patients and consumers. "
8585,0,"These new information technologies also permit efficient, real-time assessment in such areas as health status, access to care, and other aspects of the care experience that impact health outcomes."
8586,1,Surveys about the health and health care experiences of a general adult population and of adults with diabetes were administered online and by telephone. 
8587,1,The online survey drew from a sample frame of nearly 1 million consumers and used a single e-mail notification. 
8588,1,The random-digit-dial methodology included 6 follow-up calls. 
8589,1,Results from the online sample were compared to the telephone sample and to national benchmark data.
8590,2,Survey responses about quality of care collected using online and telephone methods were commensurate once they were weighted to represent the demographic distribution of the 2000 United States Census. 
8591,2,"Expected variations in health and health care quality across demographic and socioeconomic groups were largely observed, as were hypothesized associations among quality indicators and other variables. "
8592,2,Fewer individuals were required to be contacted to achieve target sample sizes using online versus telephone methods. 
8593,2,Neither method yielded representative cohorts of nonwhite individuals.
8594,3,Conclusions about the level and variations in health care quality in the United States are similar using data collected in this study compared to data collected using other telephone-based survey methods. 
8595,3,"As is typical for national telephone surveys conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, stratified sampling and weighting of survey responses is necessary for results to be generalizable. "
8596,3,Online methods are more appropriate for understanding health care quality than for conducting epidemiologic assessments of health in the United States.
8597,4,Swiss community pharmacies on the web and pharmacists experiences with e-commerce: Longitudinal study and Internet-based questionnaire survey
8598,0,"There are multiple ways in which community pharmacies can present themselves on the Internet, e.g., as a platform for drug information or as an advertising platform for their services."
8599,1,"A longitudinal study was performed to determine the number of Swiss German pharmacies on the Internet by conducting Internet searches in 2000, 2001, and 2003. "
8600,1,"In April 2002, a cross-sectional Internet-based survey was administered to explore the pharmacies' experiences and plans regarding their Web sites."
8601,2,"As of April 2003, 373 (44%) of 852 community pharmacies from the German speaking part of Switzerland were on the Internet. "
8602,2,One hundred eighty four listed an e-mail address and were asked to complete a questionnaire. 
8603,2,"Of the 107 pharmacies answering the survey questions (58% response rate): 46% had been on the Internet for 1 to 2 years; 33% of the Web sites are part of a pharmacy group's Web portal; 31% of the pharmacies plan to expand their Internet appearance in the future; 74% provide e-commerce services, with 81% of those pharmacies filling five or less orders per month; and 12% plan on expanding their e-commerce services in the future."
8604,3,The number of community pharmacies offering Internet services steadily increased over 32 months. 
8605,3,"Given the importance of the Internet as a tool for information, communication, and advertising for pharmacy products and services, it can be expected that the increase will continue. "
8606,3,Pharmacy-group portals are important promoters of pharmacies on the Internet. 
8607,3,"For many community pharmacies, Internet portals that provide an Internet presence for the pharmacies and provide regularly-updated content (e.g., health news, tips, drug information) seem to be the most effective solutions. "
8608,3,"Even though 40% of the pharmacies already offer e-commerce services, these services are still of minor importance. "
8609,3,"For many pharmacists, the current legal regulations seem to be unclear. "
8610,3,Most pharmacies want to maintain their Internet services.
8611,4,Doctors Who Are Using E-mail With Their Patients: a Qualitative Exploration
8612,0,"Despite the potential for rapid, asynchronous, documentable communication, the use of e-mail for physician-patient communication has not been widely adopted."
8613,1,In-depth phone interviews of 45 physicians currently using e-mail with patients were audio taped and transcribed verbatim. 
8614,1,Two investigators independently qualitatively coded comments. 
8615,1,Differences were adjudicated by group consensus.
8616,2,"Almost all of the 642 comments from these physicians who currently use e-mail with patients daily could be grouped into 1 of 4 broad domains: (1) e-mail access and content, (2) effects of e-mail on the doctor-patient relationship, (3) managing clinical issues by e-mail, and (4) integrating e-mail into office processes. "
8617,2,The most consistent theme was that e-mail communication enhances chronic-disease management. 
8618,2,Many physicians also reported improved continuity of care and increased flexibility in responding to nonurgent issues. 
8619,2,"Integration of e-mail into daily workflow, such as utilization of office personnel, appears to be a significant area of concern for many of the physicians. "
8620,2,"For other issues, such as content, efficiency of e-mail, and confidentiality, there were diverging experiences and opinions. "
8621,2,"Physicians appear to be selective in choosing which patients they will communicate with via e-mail, but the criteria for selection is unclear."
8622,3,These physician respondents did perceive benefits to e-mail with a select group of patients. 
8623,3,"Several areas, such as identifying clinical situations where e-mail communication is effective, incorporating e-mail into office flow, and being reimbursed for online medical care/communication, need to be addressed before this mode of communication diffuses into most practices."
8624,4,Characterizing Precision Nutrition Discourse on Twitter: Quantitative Content Analysis
8625,0,It is possible that tailoring dietary approaches to an individual's genomic profile could provide optimal dietary inputs for biological functioning and support adherence to dietary management protocols. 
8626,0,"The science required for such nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic profiling is not yet considered ready for broad application by the scientific and medical communities; however, many personalized nutrition products are available in the marketplace, creating the potential for hype and misleading information on social media. "
8627,0,Twitter provides a unique big data source that provides real-time information. 
8628,0,"Therefore, it has the potential to disseminate evidence-based health information, as well as misinformation."
8629,1,"Twitter Archiver was used to capture tweets from September 1, 2020, to December 1, 2020, using keywords related to nutrition and genetics. "
8630,1,A random sample of tweets was coded using quantitative content analysis by 4 trained coders. 
8631,1,"Codebook-driven, quantified information about tweet authors, content details, information quality, and engagement metrics were compiled and analyzed."
8632,2,The most common categories of tweets were precision nutrition products and nutrigenomic concepts. 
8633,2,"About a quarter (132/504, 26.2%) of tweet authors presented themselves as science experts, medicine experts, or both. "
8634,2,"Nutrigenetics concepts most frequently came from authors with science and medicine expertise, and tweets about the influence of genes on weight were more likely to come from authors with neither type of expertise. "
8635,2,A total of 14.9% (75/504) of the tweets were noted to contain untrue information; these were most likely to occur in the nutrigenomics concepts topic category.
8636,3,"By evaluating social media discourse on precision nutrition on Twitter, we made several observations about the content available in the information environment through which individuals can learn about related concepts and products. "
8637,3,"Tweet content was consistent with the indicators of medical hype, and the inclusion of potentially misleading and untrue information was common. "
8638,3,We identified a contingent of users with scientific and medical expertise who were active in discussing nutrigenomics concepts and products and who may be encouraged to share credible expert advice on precision nutrition and tackle false information as this technology develops.
8639,4,Evaluation of a Digital Decision Support System to Integrate Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Periodontitis Care: Case-Vignette Study in Simulated Environments
8640,0,"As highlighted by the recent World Health Organization Oral Health Resolution, there is an urgent need to better integrate primary and oral health care. "
8641,0,"Despite evidence and guidelines substantiating the relevance of integrating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and periodontitis care, the fragmentation of primary and oral health care persists."
8642,1,"The effects of the prototype DSS were assessed in web-based simulated environments, using 2 different sets of case vignettes in combination with evaluation surveys among 202 general dental practitioners (GDPs) and 206 general practitioners (GPs). "
8643,1,"Each participant evaluated 3 vignettes, one of which, chosen at random, was assisted by the DSS. "
8644,1,Logistic regression analyses were conducted at the participant and case levels.
8645,2,"Under DSS assistance, GPs had 8.3 (95% CI 4.32-16.03) times higher odds of recommending a GDP visit. "
8646,2,There was no significant impact of DSS assistance on GP advice about common risk factors for T2DM and periodontal disease. 
8647,2,"GDPs had 4.3 (95% CI 2.08-9.04) times higher odds of recommending a GP visit, 1.6 (95% CI 1.03-2.33) times higher odds of giving advice on disease correlations, and 3.2 (95% CI 1.63-6.35) times higher odds of asking patients about their glycated hemoglobin value."
8648,3,The findings of this study provide a proof of concept for a digital DSS to integrate T2DM and periodontal care. 
8649,3,"Future updating and testing is warranted to continuously enhance the functionalities of the DSS in terms of interoperability with various types of data sources and diagnostic devices; incorporation of other (oral) health dimensions; application in various settings, including via telemedicine; and further customization of end-user interfaces."
8650,4,Hot Topic Recognition of Health Rumors Based on Anti-Rumor Articles on the WeChat Official Account Platform: Topic Modeling
8651,0,Social networks have become one of the main channels for obtaining health information. 
8652,0,"However, they have also become a source of health-related misinformation, which seriously threatens the public's physical and mental health. "
8653,0,Governance of health-related misinformation can be implemented through topic identification of rumors on social networks. 
8654,0,"However, little attention has been paid to studying the types and routes of dissemination of health rumors on the internet, especially rumors regarding health-related information in Chinese social media."
8655,1,We used a web crawler tool to capture health rumor-dispelling articles on WeChat rumor-dispelling public accounts. 
8656,1,"We collected information from health-debunking articles posted between January 1, 2016, and August 31, 2022. "
8657,1,"Following word segmentation of the collected text, a document topic generation model called Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used to identify and generalize the most common topics. "
8658,1,"The proportion distribution of the themes was calculated, and the negative impact of various health rumors in different periods was analyzed. "
8659,1,"Additionally, the prevalence of health rumors was analyzed by the number of health rumors generated at each time point."
8660,2,"We collected 9366 rumor-refuting articles from January 1, 2016, to August 31, 2022, from WeChat official accounts. "
8661,2,"Through topic modeling, we divided the health rumors into 8 topics, that is, rumors on prevention and treatment of infectious diseases (1284/9366, 13.71%), disease therapy and its effects (1037/9366, 11.07%), food safety (1243/9366, 13.27%), cancer and its causes (946/9366, 10.10%), regimen and disease (1540/9366, 16.44%), transmission (914/9366, 9.76%), healthy diet (1068/9366, 11.40%), and nutrition and health (1334/9366, 14.24%). "
8662,2,"Furthermore, we summarized the 8 topics under 4 themes, that is, public health, disease, diet and health, and spread of rumors."
8663,3,Our study shows that topic modeling can provide analysis and insights into health rumor governance. 
8664,3,"The rumor development trends showed that most rumors were on public health, disease, and diet and health problems. "
8665,3,Governments still need to implement relevant and comprehensive rumor management strategies based on the rumors prevalent in their countries and formulate appropriate policies. 
8666,3,"Apart from regulating the content disseminated on social media platforms, the national quality of health education should also be improved. "
8667,3,"Governance of social networks should be clearly implemented, as these rapidly developed platforms come with privacy issues. "
8668,3,Both disseminators and receivers of information should ensure a realistic attitude and disseminate health information correctly. 
8669,3,"In addition, we recommend that sentiment analysis-related studies be conducted to verify the impact of health rumor-related topics."
8670,4,The Impact of Cybervictimization on the Self-Management of Chronic Conditions: Lived Experiences
8671,0,Cybervictimization of people with long-term conditions is a disturbing phenomenon with a documented impact on health and well-being. 
8672,0,"These experiences are primarily examined using quantitative methods, focusing on children and young people. "
8673,0,"However, research centered on the cybervictimization of adults with chronic conditions is scarce, with limited qualitative input from the victims as experts in their own experiences."
8674,1,This paper reports the findings from the qualitative phase of a phenomenologically informed mixed methods study. 
8675,1,The biographical disruption concept was used to conceptualize the study. 
8676,1,In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with 13 participants with chronic conditions who experienced cybervictimization. 
8677,1,"A codebook was developed, and a zigzag approach to thematic analysis was used to define and refine themes. "
8678,1,Ethical considerations and risk assessment were ongoing during the research process because of the sensitivity of the topic and cases of harassment.
8679,2,Cybervictimization has direct and indirect impacts on the self-management of chronic conditions. 
8680,2,This impact was verified across 6 overarching themes that emerged from this study. 
8681,2,"First, biomedical events included overall health deterioration because of existing conditions, new diagnoses, and subjective physical complaints. "
8682,2,"Second, the impact on mental health was perceived through psychological consequences and psychiatric disorders that developed after or during this traumatic experience. "
8683,2,"Third, the multilevel impact theme focused on disrupting the strategies for coping with health conditions and involved unplanned changes to victims' health management priorities. "
8684,2,"Fourth, the impact of complexity reflected the perceived uniqueness in each case, intersectionality, struggle to obtain formal support, and subsequent health complications. "
8685,2,"Fifth, social network involvement comprised the effects of social isolation, victim blaming, and deception. "
8686,2,"Finally, the disability discrimination theme focused on prejudice, issues on inclusion, and hostility in society, with subsequent effects on well-being."
8687,3,"People with long-term conditions experienced different forms of cybervictimization, all disruptive with various effects on health. "
8688,3,Disability discrimination was a prominent finding to be further investigated. 
8689,3,"This paper reports the impact as themes to guide further research and practice, with the recognition that long-term conditions and impairments are not a homogeneous group. "
8690,3,"Despite the devastating consequences, there are positive points that strengthen potential interventions. "
8691,3,"Awareness-raising campaigns, training of support channels, and multidisciplinary research are recommended to tackle this issue and initiate change."
8692,4,Effectiveness of eHealth Smoking Cessation Interventions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
8693,0,Rapid advancements in eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) technologies have driven researchers to design and evaluate numerous technology-based interventions to promote smoking cessation. 
8694,0,The evolving nature of cessation interventions emphasizes a strong need for knowledge synthesis.
8695,1,"We searched for studies published in English between 2017 and June 30, 2022, in 4 databases: PubMed (including MEDLINE), PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane Library. "
8696,1,"Two independent reviewers performed study screening, data extraction, and quality assessment based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) framework. "
8697,1,"We pooled comparable studies based on the population, follow-up time, intervention, and control characteristics. "
8698,1,Two researchers performed an independent meta-analysis on smoking abstinence using the Sidik-Jonkman random-effects model and log risk ratio (RR) as the effect measurement. 
8699,1,"For studies not included in the meta-analysis, the outcomes were narratively synthesized."
8700,2,A total of 464 studies were identified through an initial database search after removing duplicates. 
8701,2,"Following screening and full-text assessments, we deemed 39 studies (n=37,341 participants) eligible for this review. "
8702,2,"Of these, 28 studies were shortlisted for meta-analysis. "
8703,2,"According to the meta-analysis, SMS or app text messaging can significantly increase both short-term (3 months) abstinence (log RR=0.50, 95% CI 0.25-0.75; I2=0.72%) and long-term (6 months) abstinence (log RR=0.77, 95% CI 0.49-1.04; I2=8.65%), relative to minimal cessation support. "
8704,2,The frequency of texting did not significantly influence treatment outcomes. 
8705,2,"mHealth apps may significantly increase abstinence in the short term (log RR=0.76, 95% CI 0.09-1.42; I2=88.02%) but not in the long term (log RR=0.15, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.48; I2=80.06%), in contrast to less intensive cessation support. "
8706,2,"In addition, personalized or interactive interventions showed a moderate increase in cessation for both the short term (log RR=0.62, 95% CI 0.30-0.94; I2=66.50%) and long term (log RR=0.28, 95% CI 0.04-0.53; I2=73.42%). "
8707,2,"In contrast, studies without any personalized or interactive features had no significant impact. "
8708,2,"Finally, the treatment effect was similar between trials that used biochemically verified or self-reported abstinence. "
8709,2,"Among studies reporting outcomes besides abstinence (n=20), a total of 11 studies reported significantly improved nonabstinence outcomes in cigarette consumption (3/14, 21%) or user satisfaction (8/19, 42%)."
8710,3,"Our review of 39 randomized controlled trials found that recent eHealth interventions might promote smoking cessation, with mHealth being the dominant approach. "
8711,3,"Despite their success, the effectiveness of such interventions may diminish with time. "
8712,3,The design of more personalized interventions could potentially benefit future studies.Trial Registration: PROSPERO CRD42022347104; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=347104
8713,4,Emotional Expression on Social Media Support Forums for Substance Cessation: Observational Study of Text-Based Reddit Posts
8714,0,Substance use disorder is characterized by distinct cognitive processes involved in emotion regulation as well as unique emotional experiences related to the relapsing cycle of drug use and recovery. 
8715,0,"Web-based communities and the posts they generate represent an unprecedented resource for studying subjective emotional experiences, capturing population types and sizes not typically available in the laboratory. "
8716,0,"Here, we mined text data from Reddit, a social media website that hosts discussions from pseudonymous users on specific topic forums, including forums for individuals who are trying to abstain from using drugs, to explore the putative specificity of the emotional experience of substance cessation."
8717,1,"Raw text from 2 million posts made, respectively, in the fall of 2020 (discovery data set) and fall of 2019 (replication data set) were obtained from 394 forums hosted by Reddit through the application programming interface. "
8718,1,"We quantified emotion word frequencies in 3 substance cessation forums for alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis topic categories and performed comparisons with general forums. "
8719,1,Emotion word frequencies were classified into distinct categories and represented as a multidimensional emotion vector for each forum. 
8720,1,We further quantified the degree of emotional resemblance between different forums by computing cosine similarity on these vectorized representations. 
8721,1,"For substance cessation posts with self-reported time since last use, we explored changes in the use of emotion words as a function of abstinence duration."
8722,2,"Compared to posts from general forums, substance cessation posts showed more expressions of anxiety, disgust, pride, and gratitude words. "
8723,2,"""Anxiety"" emotion words were attenuated for abstinence durations >100 days compared to shorter durations (t(12)=3.08, 2-tailed; P=.001). "
8724,2,"The cosine similarity analysis identified an emotion profile preferentially expressed in the cessation posts across substances, with lesser but still prominent similarities to posts about social anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. "
8725,2,These results were replicated in the 2019 (pre-COVID-19) data and were distinct from control analyses using nonemotion words.
8726,3,"We identified a unique subjective experience phenotype of emotions associated with the cessation of 3 major substances, replicable across 2 time periods, with changes as a function of abstinence duration. "
8727,3,"Although to a lesser extent, this phenotype also quantifiably resembled the emotion phenomenology of other relevant subjective experiences (social anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). "
8728,3,"Taken together, these transdiagnostic results suggest a novel approach for the future identification of at-risk populations, allowing for the development and deployment of specific and timely interventions."
8729,4,Effects of an Artificial Intelligence Platform for Behavioral Interventions on Depression and Anxiety Symptoms: Randomized Clinical Trial
8730,0,The need for scalable delivery of mental health care services that are efficient and effective is now a major public health priority. 
8731,0,"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have the potential to improve behavioral health care services by helping clinicians collect objective data on patients' progress, streamline their workflow, and automate administrative tasks."
8732,1,The study was conducted at a community-based clinic in the United States. 
8733,1,"Participants were 47 adults referred for outpatient, individual cognitive behavioral therapy for a main diagnosis of a depressive or anxiety disorder. "
8734,1,The platform provided by Eleos Health was compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) approach during the first 2 months of therapy. 
8735,1,"This AI platform summarizes and transcribes the therapy session, provides feedback to therapists on the use of evidence-based practices, and integrates these data with routine standardized questionnaires completed by patients. "
8736,1,The information is also used to draft the session's progress note. 
8737,1,Patients were randomized to receive either therapy provided with the support of an AI platform developed by Eleos Health or TAU at the same clinic. 
8738,1,Data analysis was carried out based on intention-to-treat approach from December 2022 to January 2023. 
8739,1,The primary outcomes included the feasibility and acceptability of the AI platform. 
8740,1,"Secondary outcomes included changes in depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) scores as well as treatment attendance, satisfaction, and perceived helpfulness."
8741,2,"A total of 72 patients were approached, of whom 47 (67%) agreed to participate. "
8742,2,"Participants were adults (34/47, 72% women and 13/47, 28% men; mean age 30.64, SD 11.02 years), 23 randomized to the AI platform group, and 24 to TAU. "
8743,2,"Participants in the AI group attended, on average, 67% (mean 5.24, SD 2.31) more sessions compared to those in TAU (mean 3.14, SD 1.99). "
8744,2,"Depression and anxiety symptoms were reduced by 34% and 29% in the AI platform group versus 20% and 8% for TAU, respectively, with large effect sizes for the therapy delivered with the support of the AI platform. "
8745,2,No group difference was found in 2-month treatment satisfaction and perceived helpfulness. 
8746,2,"Further, therapists using the AI platform submitted their progress notes, on average, 55 hours earlier than therapists in the TAU group (t=-0.73; P<.001)."
8747,3,"In this randomized controlled trial, therapy provided with the support of Eleos Health demonstrated superior depression and anxiety outcomes as well as patient retention, compared with TAU. "
8748,3,These findings suggest that complementing the mental health services provided in community-based clinics with an AI platform specializing in behavioral treatment was more effective in reducing key symptoms than standard therapy.

8750,4,A Multilingual Digital Mental Health and Well-Being Chatbot (ChatPal): Pre-Post Multicenter Intervention Study
8751,0,"In recent years, advances in technology have led to an influx of mental health apps, in particular the development of mental health and well-being chatbots, which have already shown promise in terms of their efficacy, availability, and accessibility. "
8752,0,The ChatPal chatbot was developed to promote positive mental well-being among citizens living in rural areas. 
8753,0,"ChatPal is a multilingual chatbot, available in English, Scottish Gaelic, Swedish, and Finnish, containing psychoeducational content and exercises such as mindfulness and breathing, mood logging, gratitude, and thought diaries."
8754,1,A pre-post intervention study was conducted where participants were recruited to use the intervention (ChatPal) for a 12-week period. 
8755,1,"Recruitment took place across 5 regions: Northern Ireland, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, and Finland. "
8756,1,"Outcome measures included the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale, which were evaluated at baseline, midpoint, and end point. "
8757,1,Written feedback was collected from participants and subjected to qualitative analysis to identify themes.
8758,2,"A total of 348 people were recruited to the study (n=254, 73% female; n=94, 27% male) aged between 18 and 73 (mean 30) years. "
8759,2,"The well-being scores of participants improved from baseline to midpoint and from baseline to end point; however, improvement in scores was not statistically significant on the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (P=.42), the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (P=.52), or the Satisfaction With Life Scale (P=.81). "
8760,2,Individuals that had improved well-being scores (n=16) interacted more with the chatbot and were significantly younger compared to those whose well-being declined over the study (P=.03). 
8761,2,"Three themes were identified from user feedback, including ""positive experiences,"" ""mixed or neutral experiences,"" and ""negative experiences."" Positive experiences included enjoying exercises provided by the chatbot, while most of the mixed, neutral, or negative experiences mentioned liking the chatbot overall, but there were some barriers, such as technical or performance errors, that needed to be overcome."
8762,3,"Marginal improvements in mental well-being were seen in those who used ChatPal, albeit nonsignificant. "
8763,3,"We propose that the chatbot could be used along with other service offerings to complement different digital or face-to-face services, although further research should be carried out to confirm the effectiveness of this approach. "
8764,3,"Nonetheless, this paper highlights the need for blended service offerings in mental health care."
8765,4,The Mediating Role of General and Cognitive Stress on the Effect of an App-Based Intervention on Productivity Measures in Workers: Randomized Controlled Trial
8766,0,Loss of productivity is a result of absence from work (absenteeism) or of working with limitations due to illness (presenteeism). 
8767,0,"Recently, occupational mental health interventions have increasingly been delivered in digital format, as this is thought to be more convenient, flexible, easily accessible, and anonymous. "
8768,0,"However, the effectiveness of electronic mental health (e-mental health) interventions in the workplace to improve presenteeism and absenteeism remains unknown, and could be potentially mediated by psychological variables such as stress levels."
8769,1,Employees of six companies in two countries participated in a randomized controlled trial (n=210 in the intervention group and n=322 in the waitlist control group). 
8770,1,Participants in the intervention group could use the Kelaa Mental Resilience app for 4 weeks. 
8771,1,"All participants were asked to complete assessments at baseline, during the intervention, postintervention, and at a 2-week follow-up. "
8772,1,"Absenteeism and presenteeism were assessed by means of the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health, while general and cognitive stress were assessed through the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire-Revised Version. "
8773,1,Regression and mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of the Kelaa Mental Resilience app on presenteeism and absenteeism.
8774,2,"The intervention did not have a direct effect on presenteeism or absenteeism, neither at postintervention nor at follow-up. "
8775,2,"Nevertheless, general stress significantly mediated the intervention effect on presenteeism (P=.005) but not on absenteeism (P=.92), and cognitive stress mediated the effect of the intervention on both presenteeism (P<.001) and absenteeism (P=.02) right after the intervention. "
8776,2,"At the 2-week follow-up, the mediating effect of cognitive stress on presenteeism was significant (P=.04), although this was not the case for its mediating effect on absenteeism (P=.36). "
8777,2,"Additionally, at the 2-week follow-up, general stress did not mediate the intervention effect on presenteeism (P=.25) or on absenteeism (P=.72)."
8778,3,"While no direct effect of the e-mental health intervention on productivity was found in this study, our findings suggest that stress reduction could mediate the effect of the intervention on presenteeism and absenteeism. "
8779,3,"As such, e-mental health interventions that address stress in employees might also indirectly reduce presenteeism and absenteeism in these employees. "
8780,3,"However, due to study limitations such as an overrepresentation of female participants in the sample and a high proportion of attrition, these results should be interpreted with caution. "
8781,3,Future research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of interventions on productivity in the workplace.
8782,4,Efficacy of Neck-Specific Exercise With Internet Support Versus Neck-Specific Exercise at a Physiotherapy Clinic in Chronic Whiplash-Associated Disorders: Multicenter Randomized Controlled Noninferiority Trial
8783,0,"Neck-specific exercises (NSE) supervised by a physiotherapist twice a week for 12 weeks have shown good results in chronic whiplash-associated disorders (WADs), but the effect of exercise delivered via the internet is unknown."
8784,1,"In this multicenter randomized controlled noninferiority trial with masked assessors, we recruited adults aged 18-63 years with chronic WAD grade II (ie, neck pain and clinical musculoskeletal signs) or III (ie, grade II plus neurological signs). "
8785,1,Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 3-and 15-month follow-ups. 
8786,1,"The primary outcome was change in neck-related disability, measured with the Neck Disability Index (NDI; 0%-100%), with higher percentages indicating greater disability. "
8787,1,"Secondary outcomes were neck and arm pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]), physical function (Whiplash Disability Questionnaire [WDQ] and Patient-Specific Functional Scale [PSFS]), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3L and EQ VAS), and self-rated recovery (Global Rating Scale [GRS]). "
8788,1,The analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis and with the per-protocol approach as sensitivity analyses.
8789,2,"Between April 6, 2017, and September 15, 2020, 140 participants were randomly assigned to the NSEIT group (n=70) or the NSE group (n=70); 63 (90%) and 64 (91%), respectively, were followed up at 3 months, and 56 (80%) and 58 (83%), respectively, at 15 months. "
8790,2,"NSEIT demonstrated noninferiority to NSE in the primary outcome NDI, as the 1-sided 95% CI of the mean difference in change did not cross the specified noninferiority margin (7 percentage units). "
8791,2,"There were no significant between-group differences in change in NDI at the 3-or 15-month follow-up, with a mean difference of 1.4 (95% CI -2.5 to 5.3) and 0.9 (95% CI -3.6 to 5.3), respectively. "
8792,2,"In both groups, the NDI significantly decreased over time (NSEIT: mean change -10.1, 95% CI -13.7 to -6.5, effect size=1.33; NSE: mean change -9.3, 95% CI -12.8 to -5.7, effect size=1.19 at 15 months; P<.001). "
8793,2,"NSEIT was noninferior to NSE for most of the secondary outcomes except for neck pain intensity and EQ VAS, but post hoc analyses showed no differences between the groups. "
8794,2,Similar results were seen in the per-protocol population. 
8795,2,No serious adverse events were reported.
8796,3,NSEIT was noninferior to NSE in chronic WAD and required less physiotherapist time. 
8797,3,NSEIT could be used as a treatment for patients with chronic WAD grades II and III.
8798,4,Prediction of Sleep Stages Via Deep Learning Using Smartphone Audio Recordings in Home Environments: Model Development and Validation
8799,0,The growing public interest and awareness regarding the significance of sleep is driving the demand for sleep monitoring at home. 
8800,0,"In addition to various commercially available wearable and nearable devices, sound-based sleep staging via deep learning is emerging as a decent alternative for their convenience and potential accuracy. "
8801,0,"However, sound-based sleep staging has only been studied using in-laboratory sound data. "
8802,0,"In real-world sleep environments (homes), there is abundant background noise, in contrast to quiet, controlled environments such as laboratories. "
8803,0,The use of sound-based sleep staging at homes has not been investigated while it is essential for practical use on a daily basis. 
8804,0,Challenges are the lack of and the expected huge expense of acquiring a sufficient size of home data annotated with sleep stages to train a large-scale neural network.
8805,1,"To overcome the limitation of lacking home data with known sleep stages, we adopted advanced training techniques and combined home data with hospital data. "
8806,1,"The training of the model consisted of 3 components: (1) the original supervised learning using 812 pairs of hospital polysomnography (PSG) and audio recordings, and the 2 newly adopted components; (2) transfer learning from hospital to home sounds by adding 829 smartphone audio recordings at home; and (3) consistency training using augmented hospital sound data. "
8807,1,Augmented data were created by adding 8255 home noise data to hospital audio recordings. 
8808,1,"Besides, an independent test set was built by collecting 45 pairs of overnight PSG and smartphone audio recording at homes to examine the performance of the trained model."
8809,2,"The accuracy of the model was 76.2% (63.4% for wake, 64.9% for rapid-eye movement [REM], and 83.6% for non-REM) for our test set. "
8810,2,"The macro F1-score and mean per-class sensitivity were 0.714 and 0.706, respectively. "
8811,2,"The performance was robust across demographic groups such as age, gender, BMI, or sleep apnea severity (accuracy 73.4%-79.4%). "
8812,2,"In the ablation study, we evaluated the contribution of each component. "
8813,2,"While the supervised learning alone achieved accuracy of 69.2% on home sound data, adding consistency training to the supervised learning helped increase the accuracy to a larger degree (+4.3%) than adding transfer learning (+0.1%). "
8814,2,The best performance was shown when both transfer learning and consistency training were adopted (+7.0%).
8815,3,This study shows that sound-based sleep staging is feasible for home use. 
8816,3,"By adopting 2 advanced techniques (transfer learning and consistency training) the deep learning model robustly predicts sleep stages using sounds recorded at various uncontrolled home environments, without using any special equipment but smartphones only."
8817,4,Use of Digital Health Technology Among Older Adults With Cancer in the United States: Findings From a National Longitudinal Cohort Study (2015-2021)
8818,0,"Despite the benefits of digital health technology use, older adults with cancer (ie, aged 65 years) have reported challenges to technology adoption. "
8819,0,"However, there has been a lack of a good understanding of their digital health technology use patterns and the associated influential factors in the past few years."
8820,1,The National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) data set is a national longitudinal cohort study with annual survey waves of Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older. 
8821,1,Participants were community-dwelling older adults who self-reported previous or current cancer diagnoses in each round. 
8822,1,The study sample size of each round ranged from 1996 (2015) to 1131 (2021). 
8823,1,"Digital health technology use was defined as using the internet or online in the last month to order or refill prescriptions, contact medical providers, handle Medicare or other insurance matters, or get information about their health conditions. "
8824,1,"The association of sociodemographics, clinical factors (self-rated health, chronic conditions, difficulties in activities of daily living, dementia, anxiety, and depression), and physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery and grip strength) with digital health technology use was examined using design-based logistic regression. "
8825,1,All statistical analyses accounted for the complex sample design.
8826,2,The prevalence of any digital health technology use increased from 36% in 2015 to 45% in 2019. 
8827,2,"In 2020-2021, which was amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it ranged from 51% to 52%. "
8828,2,"In terms of each digital health technology use behavior, in 2015, overall, 28% of older cancer survivors used digital health technology to obtain health information, followed by contacting clinicians (19%), filling prescriptions (14%), and handling insurance (11%). "
8829,2,"Greater use of digital health technology was associated with younger age, being White, having a college or higher education, having a higher income, having more comorbidities, nondementia,"
8830,3,"Digital health technology use in older adults with cancer has gradually increased, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. "
8831,3,"However, socioeconomic and racial disparities have remained in older cancer survivors. "
8832,4,"Practical Benefits, Challenges, and Recommendations on Social Media Recruitment: Multi-Stakeholder Interview Study"
8833,0,The increasing use of social media opens new opportunities for recruiting patients for research studies. 
8834,0,"However, systematic evaluations indicate that the success of social media recruitment in terms of cost-effectiveness and representativeness depends on the type of study and its purpose."
8835,1,"We conducted semistructured interviews with 6 patients with hepatitis B who use social media and 30 experts from the following disciplines: (1) social media researchers or social scientists, (2) practical experts for social media recruitment, (3) legal experts, (4) ethics committee members, and (5) clinical researchers. "
8836,1,The interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis.
8837,2,"We found diverging expert opinions regarding the challenges and benefits of social media recruitment for research studies in four domains: (1) resources needed, (2) representativeness, (3) web-based community building, and (4) privacy considerations. "
8838,2,"Moreover, the interviewed experts provided practical advice on how to promote a research study via social media."
8839,3,"Even though recruitment strategies should always be sensitive to individual study contexts, a multiplatform approach (recruiting via several different social media platforms) with mixed-methods recruitment (web-based and offline recruitment channels) is the most beneficial recruitment strategy for many research studies. "
8840,3,"The different recruitment methods complement each other and may contribute to improving the reach of the study, the recruitment accrual, and the representativeness of the sample. "
8841,3,"However, it is important to assess the context-and project-specific appropriateness and usefulness of social media recruitment before designing the recruitment strategy."
8842,4,Using Digital Technology to Quantify Habitual Physical Activity in Community Dwellers With Cognitive Impairment: Systematic Review
8843,0,Participating in habitual physical activity (HPA) can support people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to maintain functional independence. 
8844,0,"Digital technology can continuously measure HPA objectively, capturing nuanced measures relating to its volume, intensity, pattern, and variability."
8845,1,"Key search terms were input into 6 databases: Scopus, Web of Science, Psych Articles, PsychInfo, MEDLINE, and Embase. "
8846,1,"Articles were included if they included community dwellers with dementia or MCI, reported HPA metrics derived from digital technology, were published in English, and were peer reviewed. "
8847,1,"Articles were excluded if they considered populations without dementia or MCI diagnoses, were based in aged care settings, did not concern digitally derived HPA metrics, or were only concerned with physical activity interventions. "
8848,1,Key outcomes extracted included the methods and metrics used to assess HPA and differences in HPA outcomes across the cognitive spectrum. 
8849,1,Data were synthesized narratively. 
8850,1,An adapted version of the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional Studies was used to assess the quality of articles. 
8851,1,"Due to significant heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not feasible."
8852,2,"A total of 3394 titles were identified, with 33 articles included following the systematic review. "
8853,2,The quality assessment suggested that studies were moderate-to-good quality. 
8854,2,"Accelerometers worn on the wrist or lower back were the most prevalent methods, while metrics relating to volume (eg, daily steps) were most common for measuring HPA. "
8855,2,"People with dementia had lower volumes, intensities, and variability with different daytime patterns of HPA than controls. "
8856,2,"Findings in people with MCI varied, but they demonstrated different patterns of HPA compared to controls."
8857,3,"This review highlights limitations in the current literature, including lack of standardization in methods, protocols, and metrics; limited information on validity and acceptability of methods; lack of longitudinal research; and limited associations between HPA metrics and clinically meaningful outcomes. "
8858,3,"Limitations of this review include the exclusion of functional physical activity metrics (eg, sitting/standing) and non-English articles. "
8859,3,"Recommendations from this review include suggestions for measuring and reporting HPA in people with cognitive impairment and for future research including validation of methods, development of a core set of clinically meaningful HPA outcomes, and further investigation of socioecological factors that may influence HPA participation.Trial Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020216744; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=216744"
8860,4,Promoting Well-being Among Informal Caregivers of People With HIV/AIDS in Rural Malawi: Community-Based Participatory Research Approach
8861,0,"People living with HIV/AIDS and their informal caregivers (usually family members) in Malawi do not have adequate access to patient-centered care, particularly in remote rural areas of the country because of the high burden of HIV/AIDS, coupled with a fragmented and patchy health care system. "
8862,0,"Chronic conditions require self-care strategies, which are now promoted in both developed and developing contexts but are still only emerging in sub-Saharan African countries."
8863,1,"We adopted a community-based participatory research approach, whereby the health advisory messages were designed and formulated in collaboration with informal caregivers, local medical physicians, social care workers, and community chiefs and informed by prior discussions with informal caregivers. "
8864,1,"Feedback on the quality, relevance, and applicability of the messages was gathered via individual interviews with the caregivers."
8865,2,"The results showed that the messages were widely disseminated beyond the support groups via word of mouth and highlighted a very high level of adoption of the advice contained in the messages by caregivers, who reported immediate (short-term) and long-term self-assessed benefits for themselves, their families, and their local communities."
8866,3,"This study offers a novel perspective on how to combine community-based participatory research with a cost-effective, health-oriented informational intervention that can be implemented to support effective HIV/AIDS self-care and facilitate informal caregivers' role."
8867,4,Exploring Novel Innovation Strategies to Close a Technology Gap in Neurosurgery: HORAO Crowdsourcing Campaign
8868,0,Scientific research is typically performed by expert individuals or groups who investigate potential solutions in a sequential manner. 
8869,0,"Given the current worldwide exponential increase in technical innovations, potential solutions for any new problem might already exist, even though they were developed to solve a different problem. "
8870,0,"Therefore, in crowdsourcing ideation, a research question is explained to a much larger group of individuals beyond the specialist community to obtain a multitude of diverse, outside-the-box solutions. "
8871,0,These are then assessed in parallel by a group of experts for their capacity to solve the new problem. 
8872,0,"The 2 key problems in brain tumor surgery are the difficulty of discerning the exact border between a tumor and the surrounding brain, and the difficulty of identifying the function of a specific area of the brain. "
8873,0,"Both problems could be solved by a method that visualizes the highly organized fiber tracts within the brain; the absence of fibers would reveal the tumor, whereas the spatial orientation of the tracts would reveal the area's function. "
8874,0,"To raise awareness about our challenge of developing a means of intraoperative, real-time, noninvasive identification of fiber tracts and tumor borders to improve neurosurgical oncology, we"
8875,1,We ran a prize-based crowdsourcing ideation competition called HORAO on the commercial platform HeroX. 
8876,1,Prize money previously collected through a crowdfunding campaign was offered as an incentive. 
8877,1,"Using a multistage approach, an expert jury first selected promising technical solutions based on broad, predefined criteria, coached the respective solvers in the second stage, and finally selected the winners in a conference setting. "
8878,1,We performed a postchallenge web-based survey among the solvers crowd to find out about their backgrounds and demographics.
8879,2,"Our web-based campaign reached more than 20,000 people (views). "
8880,2,"We received 45 proposals from 32 individuals and 7 teams, working in 26 countries on 4 continents. "
8881,2,"The postchallenge survey revealed that most of the submissions came from single solvers or teams working in engineering or the natural sciences, with additional submissions from other nonmedical fields. "
8882,2,We engaged in further exchanges with 3 out of the 5 finalists and finally initiated a successful scientific collaboration with the winner of the challenge.
8883,3,This open innovation competition is the first of its kind in medical technology research. 
8884,3,"A prize-based crowdsourcing ideation campaign is a promising strategy for raising awareness about a specific problem, finding innovative solutions, and establishing new scientific collaborations beyond strictly disciplinary domains."
8885,4,Efficacy of a Mobile Phone-Based Intervention on Health Behaviors and HIV/AIDS Treatment Management: Randomized Controlled Trial
8886,0,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is considered the most important intervention for HIV-positive patients; thus, encouraging the use of and adherence to ART are vital to HIV treatment outcomes. "
8887,0,Advances in web and mobile technologies hold potential in supporting HIV treatment management.
8888,1,"We performed a randomized controlled trial on 425 HIV patients in two of the largest HIV clinics in Hanoi, Vietnam. "
8889,1,Both the intervention group (238 patients) and the control group (187 patients) received regular consultations with doctors and then participated in 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits. 
8890,1,Patients in the intervention group received a theory-driven smartphone app to facilitate medication adherence and self-efficacy in HIV patients. 
8891,1,"Measurements were developed based on the Health Belief Model, which included the visual analog scale of ART Adherence, HIV Treatment Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale, and HIV Symptom Management Self-Efficacy Scale. "
8892,1,We also included the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess patients' mental health throughout treatment.
8893,2,"In the intervention group, the adherence score increased significantly (beta=1.07, 95% CI .24-1.90) after 1 month, whereas the HIV adherence self-efficacy was significantly higher after 3 months (beta=2.17, 95% CI 2.07-2.27) compared to the control group. "
8894,2,"There was a positive but low level of change in risk behaviors such as drinking, smoking, and drug use. "
8895,2,Factors related to positive change in adherence were being employed and having stable mental well-being (lower PHQ-9 scores). 
8896,2,"Factors associated with self-efficacy in treatment adherence and symptom management were gender, occupation, younger age, and having no other underlying conditions. "
8897,2,A longer duration of ART increased treatment adherence but decreased self-efficacy in symptom management.
8898,3,Our study demonstrated that the mHealth app could improve the overall ART adherence self-efficacy of patients.

8900,4,Empowering Health Care Education Through Learning Analytics: In-depth Scoping Review
8901,0,Digital education has expanded since the COVID-19 pandemic began. 
8902,0,A substantial amount of recent data on how students learn has become available for learning analytics (LA). 
8903,0,"LA denotes the ""measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs."""
8904,1,"We performed a comprehensive literature search of 10 databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ERIC, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ICTP, Scopus, and IEEE Explore. "
8905,1,"In total, 6 reviewers worked in pairs and performed title, abstract, and full-text screening. "
8906,1,We resolved disagreements on study selection by consensus and discussion with other reviewers. 
8907,1,"We included papers if they met the following criteria: papers on health care professions education, papers on digital education, and papers that collected LA data from any type of digital education platform."
8908,2,"We retrieved 1238 papers, of which 65 met the inclusion criteria. "
8909,2,"From those papers, we extracted some typical characteristics of the LA process and proposed a framework for the LA life cycle, including digital education content creation, data collection, data analytics, and the purposes of LA. "
8910,2,"Assignment materials were the most popular type of digital education content (47/65, 72%), whereas the most commonly collected data types were the number of connections to the learning materials (53/65, 82%). "
8911,2,Descriptive statistics was mostly used in data analytics in 89% (58/65) of studies. 
8912,2,"Finally, among the purposes for LA, understanding learners' interactions with the digital education platform was cited most often in 86% (56/65) of papers and understanding the relationship between interactions and student performance was cited in 63% (41/65) of papers. "
8913,2,"Far less common were the purposes of optimizing learning: the provision of at-risk intervention, feedback, and adaptive learning was found in 11, 5, and 3 papers, respectively."
8914,3,"We identified gaps for each of the 4 components of the LA life cycle, with the lack of an iterative approach while designing courses for health care professions being the most prevalent. "
8915,3,We identified only 1 instance in which the authors used knowledge from a previous course to improve the next course. 
8916,3,"Only 2 studies reported that LA was used to detect at-risk students during the course's run, compared with the overwhelming majority of other studies in which data analysis was performed only after the course was completed."
8917,4,Determinants of Implementation of a Critical Care Registry in Asia: Lessons From a Qualitative Study
8918,0,"The Collaboration for Research, Implementation, and Training in Critical Care in Asia (CCA) is implementing a critical care registry to capture real-time data to facilitate service evaluation, quality improvement, and clinical studies."
8919,1,"This study is a qualitative phenomenological inquiry using semistructured interviews with stakeholders involved in registry design, implementation, and use in 4 South Asian countries. "
8920,1,"The conceptual model of diffusion, dissemination, and sustainability of innovations in health service delivery guided interviews and analysis. "
8921,1,Interviews were coded using the Rapid Identification of Themes from Audio recordings procedure and were analyzed based on the constant comparison approach.
8922,2,A total of 32 stakeholders were interviewed. 
8923,2,Analysis of stakeholder accounts identified 3 key themes: innovation-system fit; influence of champions; and access to resources and expertise. 
8924,2,"Determinants of implementation included data sharing, research experience, system resilience, communication and networks, and relative advantage and adaptability."
8925,3,"The implementation of the registry has been possible due to efforts to increase the innovation-system fit, influence of motivated champions, and the support offered by access to resources and expertise. "
8926,3,The reliance on individuals and the priorities of other health care actors pose a risk to sustainability.
8927,4,Addictive Potential of e-Cigarettes as Reported in e-Cigarette Online Forums: Netnographic Analysis of Subjective Experiences
8928,0,"While e-cigarettes usually contain nicotine, their addictive potential is not yet fully understood. "
8929,0,"We hypothesized that if e-cigarettes are addictive, users will experience typical symptoms of addiction."
8930,1,We identified 3 large German-language e-cigarette online forums via a systematic Google search. 
8931,1,"Based on a netnographic approach, we used deductive content analysis to investigate relevant posts in these forums. "
8932,1,"Netnography has the advantage of limiting the social desirability bias that prevails in face-to-face research, such as focus groups. "
8933,1,"The data were coded according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for tobacco use disorder, adapted for e-cigarettes. "
8934,1,The DSM-5 criteria were used to portray a broad spectrum of possible experiences of addiction.
8935,2,"Overall, 5337 threads in 3 forums were screened, and 451 threads containing relevant information were included in the analysis. "
8936,2,"Users reported experiences consistent with the DSM-5 criteria, such as craving e-cigarettes, excessive time spent vaping, and health issues related to e-cigarette use. "
8937,2,"However, our analysis also showed that users reported the absence of typical tobacco use disorder criteria, such as successful attempts to reduce the nicotine dosage. "
8938,2,"For most themes, reports of their absence were more frequent than of their presence. "
8939,2,The absence of perceived addiction was mostly reported in contrast to prior tobacco smoking.
8940,3,This is the first study to use a netnographic approach to explore unfiltered self-reports of experiences of e-cigarette addiction by users in online forums. 
8941,3,"As hypothesized, some but not all users reported subjective experiences that corresponded to the criteria of tobacco use disorder as defined by the DSM-5. "
8942,3,"Nevertheless, subjective reports also indicated that many e-cigarette users felt in control of their behavior, especially in contrast to their prior use of tobacco cigarettes. "
8943,3,The finding that some e-cigarette users subjectively experience addiction highlights the need for effective cessation programs to support users who experience their e-cigarette use as burdensome. 
8944,3,This research can guide the refinement of instruments to assess e-cigarette addiction and guide cessation programs.
8945,4,The Effectiveness of Technology-Based Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training on the Skills and Knowledge of Adolescents: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
8946,0,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training for adolescents is a prominent strategy to increase the number of community first responders who can recognize cardiac arrest and initiate CPR. 
8947,0,More schools are adopting technology-based CPR training modalities to reduce class time and reliance on instructor availability and increase their capacity for wider training dissemination. 
8948,0,"However, it remains unclear whether these technology-based modalities are comparable with standard training."
8949,1,"Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and Scopus from inception to June 25, 2021. "
8950,1,Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared technology-based training with standard training for adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. 
8951,1,Studies were appraised using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. 
8952,1,Random-effects meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager (The Cochrane Collaboration). 
8953,1,Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity. 
8954,1,"Overall certainty of evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach."
8955,2,Seventeen RCTs involving 5578 adolescents were included. 
8956,2,"Most of the studies had unclear risks of selection bias (9/17, 53%) and high risks of performance bias (16/17, 94%). "
8957,2,"Interventions that included instructor guidance increased the likelihood of adolescents checking the responsiveness of the person experiencing cardiac arrest (risk ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.19-1.63) and calling the emergency medical services (risk ratio 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.24). "
8958,2,"Self-directed technology-based CPR training without instructor guidance was associated with poorer overall skill performance (Cohen d=-0.74, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.45). "
8959,2,"Training without hands-on practice increased mean compression rates (mean difference 9.38, 95% CI 5.75-13.01), whereas real-time feedback potentially yielded slower compression rates. "
8960,2,"Instructor-guided training with hands-on practice (Cohen d=0.45, 95% CI 0.13-0.78) and the use of computer programs or mobile apps (Cohen d=0.62, 95% CI 0.37-0.86) improved knowledge scores. "
8961,2,"However, certainty of evidence was very low."
8962,3,Instructor-guided technology-based CPR training that includes hands-on practice and real-time feedback is noninferior to standard training in CPR skills and knowledge among adolescents. 
8963,3,"Our findings supported the use of technology-based components such as videos, computer programs, or mobile apps for self-directed theoretical instruction. "
8964,3,"However, instructor guidance, hands-on practice, and real-time feedback are still necessary components of training to achieve better learning outcomes for adolescents. "
8965,3,Such a blended learning approach may reduce class time and reliance on instructor availability. 
8966,3,"Because of the high heterogeneity of the studies reviewed, the findings from this study should be interpreted with caution. "
8967,3,More high-quality RCTs with large sample sizes and follow-up data are needed. 
8968,3,"Finally, technology-based training can be considered a routine refresher training modality in schools for future research."
8969,4,A Novel Approach to Characterize State-level Food Environment and Predict Obesity Rate Using Social Media Data: Correlational Study
8970,0,Community obesity outcomes can reflect the food environment to which the community belongs. 
8971,0,"Recent studies have suggested that the local food environment can be measured by the degree of food accessibility, and survey data are normally used to calculate food accessibility. "
8972,0,"However, compared with survey data, social media data are organic, continuously updated, and cheaper to collect."
8973,1,"To characterize the caloric information of the local food environment, we used food categories from Yelp and collected caloric information from MyFitnessPal for each category based on their popular dishes. "
8974,1,We then calculated the average calories for each category and created a weighted score for each state. 
8975,1,"We also calculated 2 other dimensions from the concept of access, acceptability and affordability, to build obesity prediction models."
8976,2,The local food environment characterized using only publicly available social media data had a statistically significant correlation with the state obesity rate. 
8977,2,We achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.796 between the predicted obesity rate and the reported obesity rate from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System across US states and the District of Columbia. 
8978,2,The model with 3 generated feature sets achieved the best performance.
8979,3,Our study proposed a method for characterizing state-level food environments only using continuously updated social media data. 
8980,3,"State-level food environments were accurately described using social media data, and the model also showed a disparity in the available food between states with different obesity rates. "
8981,3,The proposed method should elastically apply to local food environments of different sizes and predict obesity rates effectively.
8982,4,The Feasibility and Acceptability of an mHealth Conversational Agent Designed to Support HIV Self-testing in South Africa: Cross-sectional Study
8983,0,"HIV testing rates in sub-Saharan Africa remain below the targeted threshold, and primary care facilities struggle to provide adequate services. "
8984,0,Innovative approaches that leverage digital technologies could improve HIV testing and access to treatment.
8985,1,Nolwazi_bot was designed with 4 different personalities that users could choose when selecting a counselor for their HIVST session. 
8986,1,We recruited a convenience sample of 120 consenting adults and invited them to undertake an HIV self-test facilitated by the Nolwazi_bot. 
8987,1,"After testing, participants completed an interviewer-led posttest structured survey to assess their experience with the chatbot-supported HIVST."
8988,2,"Participants (N=120) ranged in age from 18 to 47 years, with half of them being men (61/120, 50.8%). "
8989,2,"Of the 120 participants, 111 (92.5%) had tested with a human counselor more than once. "
8990,2,"Of the 120 participants, 45 (37.5%) chose to be counseled by the female Nolwazi_bot personality aged between 18 and 25 years. "
8991,2,"Approximately one-fifth (21/120, 17.5%) of the participants who underwent an HIV self-test guided by the chatbot tested positive. "
8992,2,"Most participants (95/120, 79.2%) indicated that their HIV testing experience with a chatbot was much better than that with a human counselor. "
8993,2,"Many participants (93/120, 77.5%) reported that they felt as if they were talking to a real person, stating that the response tone and word choice of Nolwazi_bot reminded them of how they speak in daily conversations."
8994,3,The study provides insights into the potential of digital technology interventions to support HIVST in low-income and middle-income countries. 
8995,3,"Although we wait to see the full benefits of mobile health, technological interventions including conversational agents or chatbots provide us with an excellent opportunity to improve HIVST by addressing the barriers associated with clinic-based HIV testing."
8996,4,Disinfection of Virtual Reality Devices in Health Care Settings: In Vitro Assessment and Survey Study
8997,0,Virtual reality (VR) devices are increasingly used in health care settings. 
8998,0,The use among patients has the potential to unintentionally transmit pathogens between patients and hospital staff. 
8999,0,No standard operating procedure for disinfection exists to ensure safe use between patients.
9000,1,Three types of bacteria were inoculated onto porous and nonporous surfaces of 2 VR devices: the Meta Oculus Quest and Meta Oculus Quest 2. 
9001,1,Disinfection was performed using either isopropyl alcohol or alcohol-free quaternary ammonium wipes. 
9002,1,A quantitative culture was used to assess the adequacy of disinfection. 
9003,1,A survey was separately sent out to VR device technicians at other pediatric health care institutes to compare the methods of disinfection and how they were established.
9004,2,"Both products achieved adequate disinfection of the treated surfaces; however, a greater log-kill was achieved on nonporous surfaces than on the porous surfaces. "
9005,2,Alcohol performed better than quaternary ammonium on porous surfaces. 
9006,2,The survey respondents reported a wide variability in disinfection processes with only 1 person reporting an established standard operating procedure.
9007,3,Disinfection can be achieved through the use of either isopropyl alcohol or quaternary ammonium products. 
9008,3,"Porous surfaces showed lesser log-kill rates than the nonporous surfaces, indicating that the use of an added barrier may be of benefit and should be a point of future research. "
9009,3,"Given the variability in the disinfection process across health care systems, a standard operating procedure is proposed."
9010,4,Estimating the Economic Value of Automated Virtual Reality Cognitive Therapy for Treating Agoraphobic Avoidance in Patients With Psychosis: Findings From the gameChange Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial
9011,0,"An automated virtual reality cognitive therapy (gameChange) has demonstrated its effectiveness to treat agoraphobia in patients with psychosis, especially for high or severe anxious avoidance. "
9012,0,Its economic value to the health care system is not yet established.
9013,1,"Using data from a randomized controlled trial with 346 patients with psychosis (ISRCTN17308399), we estimated differences in health-related quality of life, health and social care costs, and wider societal costs for patients receiving virtual reality therapy in addition to treatment as usual compared with treatment as usual alone. "
9014,1,The maximum cost-effective prices of gameChange were calculated based on UK cost-effectiveness thresholds. 
9015,1,The sensitivity of the results to analytical assumptions was tested.
9016,2,"Patients allocated to gameChange reported higher quality-adjusted life years (0.008 QALYs, 95% CI -0.010 to 0.026) and lower NHS and social care costs (-105 pound, 95% CI -1135 pound to 924) pound compared with treatment as usual (1=US pound $1.28); however, these differences were not statistically significant. "
9017,2,gameChange was estimated to be worth up to 341 pound per patient from an NHS and social care (NHS and personal social services) perspective or 1967 pound per patient from a wider societal perspective. 
9018,2,"In patients with high or severe anxious avoidance, maximum cost-effective prices rose to 877 pound and 3073 pound per patient from an NHS and personal social services perspective and societal perspective, respectively."
9019,3,"gameChange is a promising, cost-effective intervention for the UK NHS and is particularly valuable for patients with high or severe anxious avoidance. "
9020,3,This presents an opportunity to expand cost-effective psychological treatment coverage for a population with significant health needs.
9021,4,Perceptions of Quality of Care Among Users of a Web-Based Patient Portal: Cross-sectional Survey Analysis
9022,0,"Web-based patient portals enable patients access to, and interaction with, their personal electronic health records. "
9023,0,"However, little is known about the impact of patient portals on quality of care. "
9024,0,Users of patient portals can contribute important insights toward addressing this knowledge gap.
9025,1,A cross-sectional web-based survey study was conducted to understand patients' experiences with the Care Information Exchange (CIE) portal. 
9026,1,"Patient sociodemographic data were collected, including age, sex, ethnicity, educational level, health status, geographic location, motivation to self-manage, and digital health literacy (measured by the eHealth Literacy Scale). "
9027,1,"Patients with experience using CIE, who specified both age and sex, were included in these analyses. "
9028,1,Relevant survey items (closed-ended questions) were mapped to the Institute of Medicine's 6 domains of quality of care. 
9029,1,"Users' responses were examined to understand their perceptions of how portal use has changed the overall quality of their care, different aspects of care related to the 6 domains of care quality, and patient's satisfaction with care. "
9030,1,Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to identify patient characteristics associated with perceived improvements in overall care quality and greater satisfaction with care.
9031,2,"Of 445 CIE users, 38.7% (n=172) reported that the overall quality of their care was better; 3.2% (n=14) said their care was worse. "
9032,2,"In the patient centeredness domain, 61.2% (273/445) of patients felt more in control of their health care, and 53.9% (240/445) felt able to play a greater role in decision-making. "
9033,2,"Regarding timeliness, 40.2% (179/445) of patients reported they could access appointments, diagnoses, and treatment more quickly. "
9034,2,"Approximately 30% of CIE users reported better care related to the domains of effectiveness (123/445, 27.6%), safety (138/445, 31%), and efficiency (174/445, 28.6%). "
9035,2,"Regarding equity, patients self-reporting higher digital health literacy (odds ratio 2.40, 95% CI 1.07-5.42; P=.03) and those belonging to ethnic minority groups (odds ratio 2.27, 95% CI 1.26-3.73; P<.005) were more likely to perceive improvements in care quality. "
9036,2,"Across ethnic groups, Asian and British Asian patients perceived the greatest benefits. "
9037,2,Increased frequency of CIE use also predicted perceived better care quality and greater satisfaction with care.
9038,3,"A large proportion of CIE users perceived better care quality and greater satisfaction with care, although many portal users reported no change. "
9039,3,The most favorable perceived improvements related to the domain of patient centeredness. 
9040,3,"With national policy directed toward addressing health disparities, patient portals could be valuable in improving care quality for ethnic minority groups. "
9041,3,Future research should test the causal relationship between patient portal use and care quality.
9042,4,Real-world Implementation of an eHealth System Based on Artificial Intelligence Designed to Predict and Reduce Emergency Department Visits by Older Adults: Pragmatic Trial
9043,0,"Frail older people use emergency services extensively, and digital systems that monitor health remotely could be useful in reducing these visits by earlier detection of worsening health conditions."
9044,1,An uncontrolled multicenter trial was conducted in community-dwelling older adults receiving assistance from home aides (HAs). 
9045,1,We implemented an eHealth system that produces an alert for a high risk of ED visits. 
9046,1,"After each home visit, the HAs completed a questionnaire on participants' functional status, using a smartphone app, and the information was processed in real time by a previously developed machine learning algorithm that identifies patients at risk of an ED visit within 14 days. "
9047,1,"In case of risk, the eHealth system alerted a coordinating nurse who could then inform the family carer and the patient's nurses or general practitioner. "
9048,1,The primary outcomes were the rate of ED visits and the number of deaths after alert-triggered health interventions (ATHIs) and users' experience with the eHealth system; the secondary outcome was the accuracy of the eHealth system in predicting ED visits.
9049,2,"We included 206 patients (mean age 85, SD 8 years; 161/206, 78% women) who received aid from 109 HAs, and the mean follow-up period was 10 months. "
9050,2,"The HAs monitored 2656 visits, which resulted in 405 alerts. "
9051,2,"Two ED visits were recorded following 131 alerts with an ATHI (2/131, 1.5%), whereas 36 ED visits were recorded following 274 alerts that did not result in an ATHI (36/274, 13.4%), corresponding to an odds ratio of 0.10 (95% IC 0.02-0.43; P<.001). "
9052,2,Five patients died during the study. 
9053,2,"All had alerts, 4 did not have an ATHI and were hospitalized, and 1 had an ATHI (P=.04). "
9054,2,"In terms of overall usability, the digital system was easy to use for 90% (98/109) of HAs, and response time was acceptable for 89% (98/109) of them."
9055,3,"The eHealth system has been successfully implemented, was appreciated by users, and produced relevant alerts. "
9056,3,"ATHIs were associated with a lower rate of ED visits, suggesting that the eHealth system might be effective in lowering the number of ED visits in this population."
9057,4,Determination of Markers of Successful Implementation of Mental Health Apps for Young People: Systematic Review
9058,0,Smartphone apps have the potential to address some of the current issues facing service provision for young people's mental health by improving the scalability of evidence-based mental health interventions. 
9059,0,"However, very few apps have been successfully implemented, and consensus on implementation measurement is lacking."
9060,1,"Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, an electronic search of 5 databases in 2021 yielded 18,660 results. "
9061,1,"After full-text screening, 34 articles met the full eligibility criteria, providing data on 29 smartphone apps studied with individuals aged 15 to 25 years."
9062,2,"Of 34 studies, only 10 (29%) studies were identified that were evaluating the effectiveness of 8 existing, commercially available mental health apps, and the remaining 24 (71%) studies reported the development and evaluation of 21 newly developed apps, of which 43% (9/21) were available, commercially or otherwise (eg, in mental health services), at the time of enquiry. "
9063,2,"Most studies addressed some implementation components including adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and engagement. "
9064,2,"Factors including high cost, funding constraints, and lengthy research processes impeded implementation."
9065,3,"Without addressing common implementation drivers, there is considerable redundancy in the translation of mobile mental health research findings into practice. "
9066,3,"Studies should embed implementation strategies from the outset of the planned research, build collaborations with partners already working in the field (academic and commercial) to capitalize on existing interventions and platforms, and modify and evaluate them for local contexts or target problems and populations."
9067,4,Development of Principles for Health-Related Information on Social Media: Delphi Study
9068,0,Health-related misinformation can be propagated via social media and is a threat to public health. 
9069,0,"Several quality assessment tools and principles to evaluate health-related information in the public domain exist; however, these were not designed specifically for social media."
9070,1,A modified Delphi approach was used to obtain expert consensus on the principles and functions of PRHISM. 
9071,1,"Health and social media experts were recruited via Twitter, email, and snowballing. "
9072,1,A total of 3 surveys were administered between February 2021 and May 2021. 
9073,1,The first survey was informed by a literature review and included open-ended questions and items from existing quality assessment tools. 
9074,1,Subsequent surveys were informed by the results of the proceeding survey. 
9075,1,"Consensus was deemed if >= 80% agreement was reached, and items with consensus were considered relevant to include in PRHISM. "
9076,1,"After the third survey, principles were finalized, and an instruction manual and scoring tool for PRHISM were developed and circulated to expert participants for final feedback."
9077,2,"A total of 34 experts consented to participate, of whom 18 (53%) responded to all 3 Delphi surveys. "
9078,2,"In total, 13 principles were considered relevant and were included in PRHISM. "
9079,2,"When the instructions and PRHISM scoring tool were circulated, no objections to the wording of the final principles were received."
9080,3,"A total of 13 quality principles were included in the PRHISM tool, along with a scoring system and implementation tool. "
9081,3,"The principles promote accessibility, transparency, provision of authoritative and evidence-based information and support for consumers' relationships with health care providers. "
9082,3,PRHISM can be used to evaluate the quality of health-related information provided on social media. 
9083,3,These principles may also be useful to content creators for developing high-quality health-related social media content and assist consumers in discerning high- and low-quality information.
9084,4,"The Role of Information Infrastructures in Scaling up Video Consultations During COVID-19: Mixed Methods Case Study Into Opportunity, Disruption, and Exposure"
9085,0,"Until COVID-19, implementation and uptake of video consultations in health care was slow. "
9086,0,"However, the pandemic created a ""burning platform"" for scaling up such services. "
9087,0,"As health care organizations look to expand and maintain the use of video in the ""new normal,"" it is important to understand infrastructural influences and changes that emerged during the pandemic and that may influence sustainability going forward."
9088,1,A mixed methods case study of 4 NHS trusts in England was conducted before and during the pandemic. 
9089,1,"Data comprised 90 interviews with 49 participants (eg, clinicians, managers, administrators, and IT support), ethnographic field notes, and video consultation activity data. "
9090,1,We sought examples of infrastructural features and challenges related to the rapid scale-up of video. 
9091,1,"Analysis was guided by Gkeredakis et al's 3 perspectives on crisis and digital change: as opportunity (for accelerated innovation and removal of barriers to experimentation), disruption (to organizational practices, generating new dependencies and risks), and exposure (of vulnerabilities in both people and infrastructure)."
9092,2,"Before COVID-19, there was a strong policy push for video consultations as a way of delivering health care efficiently. "
9093,2,"However, the spread of video was slow, and adopting clinicians described their use as ad hoc rather than business as usual. "
9094,2,"When the pandemic hit, video was rapidly scaled up. "
9095,2,"The most rapid increase in use was during the first month of the pandemic (March-April 2020), from an average of 8 video consultations per week to 171 per week at each site. "
9096,2,"Uptake continued to increase during the pandemic, averaging approximately 800 video consultations per week by March 2021. "
9097,2,"From an opportunity perspective, participants talked about changes to institutional elements of infrastructure, which had historically restricted the introduction and use of video. "
9098,2,"This was supported by an ""organizing vision"" for video, bringing legitimacy and support. "
9099,2,"Perspectives on disruption centered on changes to social, technical, and material work environments and the emergence of new patterns of action. "
9100,2,Retaining positive elements of such change required a judicious balance between managerial (top-down) and emergent (bottom-up) approaches. 
9101,2,Perspectives on exposure foregrounded social and technical impediments to video consulting. 
9102,2,"This highlighted the need to attend to the materiality and dependability of the installed base, as well as the social and cultural context of use."
9103,3,"For sustained adoption at scale, health care organizations need to enable incremental systemic change and flexibility through agile governance and knowledge transfer pathways, support process multiplicity within virtual clinic workflows, attend to the materiality and dependability of the IT infrastructure within and beyond organizational boundaries, and maintain an overall narrative within which the continued use of video can be framed."
9104,4,The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews
9105,0,"Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. "
9106,0,"However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted."
9107,1,"Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. "
9108,1,We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. 
9109,1,"We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. "
9110,1,The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors.
9111,2,"This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. "
9112,2,"On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. "
9113,2,"However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. "
9114,2,"In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted."
9115,3,"The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. "
9116,3,"Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. "
9117,3,"Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients' clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers."
9118,4,Exploring Social Support in an Online Support Community for Tourette Syndrome and Tic Disorders: Analysis of Postings
9119,0,"Online support communities have become an accessible way of gaining social, emotional, and informational support from peers and may be particularly useful for individuals with chronic conditions. "
9120,0,"To date, there have been few studies exploring the online support available for tic disorders, such as Tourette syndrome. "
9121,0,"An exploratory study looking at users' experiences with using online support communities for tic disorders suggested that members used such communities to share experiences, information, and strategies for tic management."
9122,1,"Data were collected from one publicly available online support community for Tourette syndrome and tics, from its inception to December 2019, by randomly selecting 10% of posts and their corresponding comments from each year for analysis. "
9123,1,This resulted in 510 unique posts and 3802 comments posted from 1270 unique usernames. 
9124,1,The data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.
9125,2,"The findings of this study suggest that users utilized the online community as a multifaceted virtual place where they could share and ask for information about tics, unload and share their feelings arising from living with Tourette syndrome, find people facing similar situations and experiences, and freely share the realities of living with Tourette syndrome."
9126,3,The results complement the findings from a preliminary study and suggest that online support communities have a potentially valuable role as a mechanism for sharing and gaining information on illness experiences from similar peers experiencing tics and can promote self-management of tics. 
9127,3,Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed.
9128,4,Engagement With HIV and COVID-19 Prevention: Nationwide Cross-sectional Analysis of Users on a Geosocial Networking App
9129,0,"Geosocial networking (GSN) apps play a pivotal role in catalyzing sexual partnering, especially among men who have sex with men."
9130,1,Web-based Grindr profiles from the top 50 metropolitan areas as well as the 50 most rural counties in the United States by population were randomly sampled. 
9131,1,"Grindr provides an option to disclose current PrEP use (HIV positive, HIV negative, or HIV negative with PrEP use). "
9132,1,"The free text in all profiles was analyzed, and any mention of COVID-19 vaccination was recorded. "
9133,1,Multivariable logistic regression to assess independent associations with PrEP disclosure and COVID-19 vaccination was performed. 
9134,1,Imputation analyses were used to test the robustness of the results.
9135,2,We evaluated 1889 urban and 384 rural profiles. 
9136,2,Mean age among urban profiles was 32.9 (SD 9.6) years; mean age among rural profiles was 33.5 (SD 12.1) years (P=.41). 
9137,2,"Among the urban profiles, 16% reported being vaccinated against COVID-19 and 23% reported PrEP use compared to 10% and 8% in rural profiles, respectively (P=.002 and P<.001, respectively). "
9138,2,"Reporting COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4), living in an urban center (aOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.8-5.7), and showing a face picture as part of the Grindr profile (aOR 4.0, 95% CI 2.3-7.0) were positively associated with PrEP disclosure. "
9139,2,"Self-identified Black and Latino users were less likely to report PrEP use (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9 and aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.9, respectively). "
9140,2,"Reporting PrEP use (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4), living in an urban center (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.5), having a ""discreet"" status (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.5), and showing a face picture (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.5-4.8) were positively associated with reporting COVID-19 vaccination on their profile. "
9141,2,"Users in the southern United States were less likely to report COVID-19 vaccination status than those in the northeast United States (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-0.9)."
9142,3,"Variations in PrEP disclosure are associated with race, whereas COVID-19 vaccination disclosure is associated with geographic area. "
9143,3,"However, rural GSN users were less likely to report both PrEP use and COVID-19 vaccination. "
9144,3,The data demonstrate a need to expand health preventative services in the rural United States for sexual minorities. 
9145,3,GSN platforms may be ideal for deployment of preventative interventions to improve access for this difficult-to-reach population.
9146,4,Next-Generation Capabilities in Trusted Research Environments: Interview Study
9147,0,"A Trusted Research Environment (TRE; also known as a Safe Haven) is an environment supported by trained staff and agreed processes (principles and standards), providing access to data for research while protecting patient confidentiality. "
9148,0,Accessing sensitive data without compromising the privacy and security of the data is a complex process.
9149,1,"We contacted 73 TRE operators, 22 (30%) of whom, in the United Kingdom and internationally, agreed to be interviewed remotely under a nondisclosure agreement and to complete a questionnaire about their TRE."
9150,2,We observed many similar processes and standards that TREs follow to adhere to the Seven Safes principles. 
9151,2,"The security processes and TRE capabilities for supporting observational studies using classical statistical methods were mature, and the requirements were well understood. "
9152,2,"However, we identified limitations in the security measures and capabilities of TREs to support ""next-generation"" requirements such as wide ranges of data types, ability to develop artificial intelligence algorithms and software within the environment, handling of big data, and timely import and export of data."
9153,3,We found a lack of software or other automation tools to support the community and limited knowledge of how to meet the next-generation requirements from the research community. 
9154,3,"Disclosure control for exporting artificial intelligence algorithms and software was found to be particularly challenging, and there is a clear need for additional controls to support this capability within TREs."
9155,4,Medication Use and Clinical Outcomes by the Dutch Institute for Clinical Auditing Medicines Program: Quantitative Analysis
9156,0,The Dutch Institute for Clinical Auditing (DICA) Medicines Program was set up in September 2018 to evaluate expensive medicine use in daily practice in terms of real-world effectiveness using only existing data sources.
9157,1,"A total of 3 national population-based registries were linked to clinical and financial data from the hospital pharmacy, the Dutch diagnosis treatment combinations information system including in-hospital activities, and survival data from health care insurers. "
9158,1,"The first results of the real-world data (RWD) linkage are presented using descriptive statistics to assess patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. "
9159,1,Time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
9160,2,"A total of 21 Dutch hospitals participated in the DICA Medicines Program, which included 7412 patients with colorectal cancer, 1981 patients with metastasized colon cancer, 3860 patients with lung cancer, 1253 patients with metastasized breast cancer, and 7564 patients with rheumatic disease. "
9161,2,"The data were used for hospital benchmarking to gain insights into medication use in specific patient populations, treatment information, clinical outcomes, and costs. "
9162,2,Detailed treatment information (duration and treatment steps) led to insights into differences between hospitals in daily clinical practices. 
9163,2,"Furthermore, exploratory analyses on clinical outcomes (TTNT and OS) were possible."
9164,3,The DICA Medicines Program shows that it is possible to gather and link RWD about medicines to 4 disease-specific population-based registries. 
9165,3,"Since these RWD became available with minimal registration burden and effort for hospitals, this method can be explored in other population-based registries to evaluate real-world efficacy."
9166,4,Video Relay Interpretation and Overcoming Barriers in Health Care for Deaf Users: Scoping Review
9167,0,"Persons who are deaf are more likely to avoid health care providers than those who can hear, partially because of the lack of means of communication with these providers and the dearth of available interpreters. "
9168,0,"The use of video remote interpretation, namely the video camera on an electronic device, to connect deaf patients and health providers has rapidly expanded owing to its flexibility and advantageous cost compared with in-person sign language interpretation. "
9169,0,"Thus, we need to learn more about how this technology could effectively engage with and respond to the priorities of its users."
9170,1,"We conducted a search in 7 medical research databases (including MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar) from 2006 including bibliographies and citations of relevant papers. "
9171,1,"The searches included articles in English, Spanish, and French. "
9172,1,"The eligibility criteria for study selection included original articles on the use of VRI for deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) sign language users for, or within, health care."
9173,2,"From the original 176 articles identified, 120 were eliminated after reading the article title and abstract, and 41 articles were excluded after they were fully read. "
9174,2,"In total, 15 articles were included in this study: 4 studies were literature reviews, 4 were surveys, 3 were qualitative studies, and 1 was a mixed methods study that combined qualitative and quantitative data, 1 brief communication, 1 quality improvement report, and 1 secondary analysis. "
9175,2,"In this scoping review, we identified a knowledge gap regarding the quality of interpretation and training in sign language interpretation for health care. "
9176,2,"It also shows that this area is underresearched, and evidence is scant. "
9177,2,"All evidence came from high-income countries, which is particularly problematic given that most DHH persons live in low- and middle-income countries."
9178,3,Furthering our understanding of the use of VRI technology is pertinent and relevant. 
9179,3,The available literature shows that VRI may enable deaf users to overcome interpretation barriers and can potentially improve communication outcomes between them and health personnel within health care services. 
9180,3,"For VRI to be acceptable, sign language users require a VRI system supported by devices with large screens and a reliable internet connection, as well as qualified interpreters trained on medical interpretation."
9181,4,Outpatient Care Among Users and Nonusers of Direct-to-Patient Telehealth: Observational Study
9182,0,Expansion of telehealth insurance coverage is hampered by concerns that such coverage may encourage excessive use and spending.
9183,1,We examined claims data from a large national insurer in 2017. 
9184,1,"We limited our analysis to patients with visits for 3 common diagnoses (N=660,546). "
9185,1,"We calculated the total number of visits per patient, overall, and by setting, and adjusted for patient- and county-level factors."
9186,2,"After multivariable adjustment, telehealth-visit users, compared to nonusers, had 0.44 fewer visits to primary care, 0.11 fewer visits to emergency departments, and 0.17 fewer visits to retail and urgent care. "
9187,2,All estimates are statistically significant at P <.001. 
9188,2,Average payment rates for telehealth visits were lower than all other settings.
9189,3,These findings suggest that telehealth visits may substitute rather than add to in-person care for some types of care. 
9190,3,Our study suggests that telehealth visits may offer an efficient and less costly alternative.
9191,4,A Virtual Community of Practice to Support Physician Uptake of a Novel Abortion Practice: Mixed Methods Case Study
9192,0,Virtual communities of practice (VCoPs) have been used to support innovation and quality in clinical care. 
9193,0,The drug mifepristone was introduced in Canada in 2017 for medical abortion. 
9194,0,We created a VCoP to support implementation of mifepristone abortion practice across Canada.
9195,1,This was a mixed methods intrinsic case study of Canadian health care providers' use and physicians' perceptions of the CAPS-CPCA VCoP during the first 2 years of a novel practice. 
9196,1,We sampled both physicians who joined the CAPS-CPCA VCoP and those who were interested in providing the novel practice but did not join the VCoP. 
9197,1,We designed the VCoP features to address known and discovered barriers to implementation of medication abortion in primary care. 
9198,1,"Our secure web-based platform allowed asynchronous access to information, practice resources, clinical support, discussion forums, and email notices. "
9199,1,We collected data from the platform and through surveys of physician members as well as interviews with physician members and nonmembers. 
9200,1,"We analyzed descriptive statistics for website metrics, physicians' characteristics and practices, and their use of the VCoP. "
9201,1,We used qualitative methods to explore the physicians' experiences and perceptions of the VCoP.
9202,2,"From January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2019, a total of 430 physicians representing all provinces and territories in Canada joined the VCoP and 222 (51.6%) completed a baseline survey. "
9203,2,"Of these 222 respondents, 156 (70.3%) were family physicians, 170 (80.2%) were women, and 78 (35.1%) had no prior abortion experience. "
9204,2,"In a survey conducted 12 months after baseline, 77.9% (120/154) of the respondents stated that they had provided mifepristone abortion and 33.9% (43/127) said the VCoP had been important or very important. "
9205,2,"Logging in to the site was burdensome for some, but members valued downloadable resources such as patient information sheets, consent forms, and clinical checklists. "
9206,2,They found email announcements helpful for keeping up to date with changing regulations. 
9207,2,"Few asked clinical questions to the VCoP experts, but physicians felt that this feature was important for isolated or rural providers. "
9208,2,Information collected through member polls about health system barriers to implementation was used in the project's knowledge translation activities with policy makers to mitigate these barriers.
9209,3,"A VCoP developed to address known and discovered barriers to uptake of a novel medication abortion method engaged physicians from across Canada and supported some, including those with no prior abortion experience, to implement this practice."
9210,4,Using Smartphone Sensor Paradata and Personalized Machine Learning Models to Infer Participants Well-being: Ecological Momentary Assessment
9211,0,Sensors embedded in smartphones allow for the passive momentary quantification of people's states in the context of their daily lives in real time. 
9212,0,Such data could be useful for alleviating the burden of ecological momentary assessments and increasing utility in clinical assessments. 
9213,0,"Despite existing research on using passive sensor data to assess participants' moment-to-moment states and activity levels, only limited research has investigated temporally linking sensor assessment and self-reported assessment to further integrate the 2 methodologies."
9214,1,We trained personalized machine learning models on data from employees (N=158) who participated in a 3-week ecological momentary assessment study.
9215,2,The results suggested that passive smartphone sensor data paired with personalized machine learning models can be used to infer individuals' self-reported states at later measurement occasions. 
9216,2,"The mean R-2 was approximately 0.31 (SD 0.29), and more than half of the participants (119/158, 75.3%) had an R-2 of >= 0.18. "
9217,2,Accuracy was only slightly attenuated compared with earlier studies and ranged from 38.41% to 51.38%.
9218,3,Personalized machine learning models and temporally linked passive sensing data have the capability to infer a sizable proportion of variance in individuals' daily self-reported states. 
9219,3,Further research is needed to investigate factors that affect the accuracy and reliability of the inference.
9220,4,Challenges in Participant Engagement and Retention Using Mobile Health Apps: Literature Review
9221,0,Mobile health (mHealth) apps are revolutionizing the way clinicians and researchers monitor and manage the health of their participants. 
9222,0,"However, many studies using mHealth apps are hampered by substantial participant dropout or attrition, which may impact the representativeness of the sample and the effectiveness of the study. "
9223,0,"Therefore, it is imperative for researchers to understand what makes participants stay with mHealth apps or studies using mHealth apps."
9224,1,"We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases for mHealth studies that evaluated and assessed issues or strategies to improve the engagement and retention of adults from 2015 to 2020. "
9225,1,We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. 
9226,1,Notable themes were identified and narratively compared among different studies. 
9227,1,A binomial regression model was generated to examine the factors affecting retention.
9228,2,"Of the 389 identified studies, 62 (15.9%) were included in this review. "
9229,2,"Overall, most studies were partially successful in maintaining participant engagement. "
9230,2,"Factors related to particular elements of the app (eg, feedback, appropriate reminders, and in-app support from peers or coaches) and research strategies (eg, compensation and niche samples) that promote retention were identified. "
9231,2,"Factors that obstructed retention were also identified (eg, lack of support features, technical difficulties, and usefulness of the app). "
9232,2,The regression model results showed that a participant is more likely to drop out than to be retained.
9233,3,Retaining participants is an omnipresent challenge in mHealth studies. 
9234,3,The insights from this review can help inform future studies about the factors and strategies to improve participant retention.
9235,4,Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Nationwide Routine Care: Effectiveness Study
9236,0,"Therapist-supported, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is efficacious for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but few studies are yet to report its effectiveness in routine care."
9237,1,"We administered a specialized, clinic-delivered, therapist-supported iCBT for GAD in 1099 physician-referred patients. "
9238,1,"The program was free of charge for patients, and the completion time was not predetermined. "
9239,1,"We measured symptoms with web-based questionnaires The primary measure of anxiety was the GAD 7-item scale (GAD-7); secondary measures were, for pathological worry, the Penn State Worry Questionnaire and, for anxiety and impairment, the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale."
9240,2,"Patients completed a mean 7.8 (SD 4.2; 65.1%) of 12 sessions, and 44.1% (485/1099) of patients completed all sessions. "
9241,2,"The effect size in the whole sample for GAD-7 was large (Cohen d=0.97, 95% CI 0.88-1.06). "
9242,2,"For completers, effect sizes were very large (Cohen d=1.34, 95% CI 1.25-1.53 for GAD-7; Cohen d= 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.27 for Penn State Worry Questionnaire; and Cohen d=1.23, 95% CI 1.09-1.37 for Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale). "
9243,2,Noncompleters also benefited from the treatment. 
9244,2,"Greater symptomatic GAD-7-measured relief was associated with more completed sessions, older age, and being referred from private or occupational care. "
9245,2,"Of the 894 patients with a baseline GAD-7 score >= 10, approximately 421 (47.1%) achieved reliable recovery."
9246,3,"This nationwide, free-of-charge, therapist-supported HUS Helsinki University Hospital-iCBT for GAD was effective in routine care, but further research must establish effectiveness against other treatments and optimize the design of iCBT for GAD for different patient groups and individual patients."
9247,4,The Characteristics and Functionalities of Mobile Apps Aimed at Patients Diagnosed With Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases: Systematic App Search
9248,0,Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are systemic conditions associated with a high social and health impact. 
9249,0,New treatments have changed the prognosis of IMIDs and have increased patient autonomy in disease management. 
9250,0,Mobile apps have enormous potential to improve health outcomes in patients with IMIDs. 
9251,0,"Although a large number of IMID apps are available, the app market is not regulated, and functionality and reliability remain uncertain."
9252,1,"We performed an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study of all apps for patients with IMIDs. "
9253,1,"Between April 5 and 14, 2021, we conducted a search of the App Store (iOS) and Play Store (Android) platforms. "
9254,1,We used the names of the different IMIDs as search terms. 
9255,1,"The inclusion criteria were as follows: content related to IMIDs, English or Spanish language, and user population consisting of patients and health care consumers, including family and caregivers. "
9256,1,"The variables analyzed were as follows: app name, type of IMID, platform (Android or iOS), country of origin, language, category of the app, cost, date of the last update, size, downloads, author affiliation, and functionalities."
9257,2,"We identified 713 apps in the initial search, and 243 apps met the criteria and were analyzed. "
9258,2,"Of these, 37% (n=90) were on Android, 27.2% (n=66) on iOS, and 35.8% (n=87) on both platforms. "
9259,2,"The most frequent categories were health and well-being/fitness apps (n=188, 48.5%) and medicine (n=82, 37.9%). "
9260,2,A total of 211 (82.3%) apps were free. 
9261,2,The mean time between the date of the analysis and the date of the most recent update was 18.5 (SD 19.3) months. 
9262,2,Health care professionals were involved in the development of 100 (41.1%) apps. 
9263,2,"We found differences between Android and iOS in the mean time since the last update (16.2, SD 14.7 months vs 30.3, SD 25.7 months) and free apps (85.6% vs 75.8%; respectively). "
9264,2,"The functionalities were as follows: general information about lifestyles, nutrition, or exercises (n=135, 55.6%); specific information about the disease or treatment (n=102, 42%); recording of symptoms or adverse events (n=51, 21%); agenda/calendar (n=44, 18.1%); reminder medication (n=41, 16.9%); and recording of patient-reported outcomes (n=41, 16.9%). "
9265,2,A total of 147 (60.5%) apps had more than one functionality.
9266,3,IMID-related apps are heterogeneous in terms of functionality and reliability. 
9267,3,"Apps may be a useful complement to IMID care, especially inpatient education (their most frequent functionality). "
9268,3,"However, more than half of the IMID apps had not been developed by health care professionals or updated in the last year."
9269,4,Digital Health Promotion and Prevention in Settings: Scoping Review
9270,0,"Digital technologies are increasingly integrating into people's daily living environments such as schools, sport clubs, and health care facilities. "
9271,0,"These settings play a crucial role for health promotion and prevention because they affect the health of their members, as the World Health Organization has declared. "
9272,0,"Implementing digital health promotion and prevention in settings offers the opportunity to reach specific target groups, lower the costs of implementation, and improve the health of the population. "
9273,0,"Currently, there is a lack of scientific evidence that reviews the research on digital health promotion and prevention in settings."
9274,1,"The scoping review was conducted following the Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien framework. "
9275,1,We searched scientific databases and gray literature for articles on digital setting-based health promotion and prevention published from 2010 to January 2020. 
9276,1,We included empirical and nonempirical publications in English or German and excluded secondary or tertiary prevention and health promotion at the workplace.
9277,2,"From 8888 records, the search resulted in 200 (2.25%) included publications. "
9278,2,We identified a huge diversity of literature regarding digital setting-based health promotion and prevention. 
9279,2,"The variety of technology types extends from computer-and web-based programs to mobile devices (eg, smartphone apps) and telemonitoring devices (sensors). "
9280,2,"We found analog, digital, and blended settings in which digital health promotion and prevention takes place. "
9281,2,"The most frequent analog settings were schools (39/200, 19.5%) and neighborhoods or communities (24/200, 12%). "
9282,2,Social media apps were also included because in some studies they were defined as a (digital) setting. 
9283,2,They accounted for 31.5% (63/200) of the identified settings. 
9284,2,"The most commonly focused areas of health promotion and prevention were physical activity (81/200, 40.5%), nutrition (45/200, 22.5%), and sexual health (34/200, 17%). "
9285,2,"Most of the interventions combined several health promotion or prevention methods, including environmental change; providing information, social support, training, or incentives; and monitoring. "
9286,2,"Finally, we found that the articles mostly reported on behavioral rather than structural health promotion and prevention."
9287,3,The research field of digital health promotion and prevention in settings is heterogeneous. 
9288,3,"At the same time, we identified research gaps regarding the absence of valid definitions of relevant terms (eg, digital settings) and the lack of literature on structural health promotion and prevention in settings. "
9289,3,"Therefore, it remains unclear how digital technologies can contribute to structural (or organizational) changes in settings. "
9290,3,More research is needed to successfully implement digital technologies to achieve health promotion and prevention in settings.
9291,4,Encouraging Behavior Changes and Preventing Cardiovascular Diseases Using the Prevent Connect Mobile Health App: Conception and Evaluation of App Quality
9292,0,Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death worldwide. 
9293,0,"Mobile health apps could help in preventing cardiovascular diseases by improving modifiable risk factors such as eating habits, physical activity levels, and alcohol or tobacco consumption."
9294,1,"The knowledge base of the app is based on French national recommendations for healthy eating, physical activity, and limiting alcohol and tobacco consumption. "
9295,1,It contains a list of patient behaviors and related personalized recommendations and digital health interventions. 
9296,1,The interface was designed according to usability principles. 
9297,1,"Its quality was assessed by a panel of 52 users in a 5-step process: completion of the demographic form, visualization of a short presentation of the app, testing of the app, completion of the user version of the Mobile App Rating Scale (uMARS), and an open group discussion."
9298,2,"This app assesses patient behaviors through specific questionnaires about 4 risk factors (unhealthy eating, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol, and tobacco consumption) and suggests personalized recommendations and digital health interventions for improving behavior. "
9299,2,"The app was deemed to be of good quality, with a mean uMARS quality score of 4 on a 5-point Likert scale. "
9300,2,"The functionality and information content of the app were particularly appreciated, with a mean uMARS score above 4. "
9301,2,Almost all the study participants appreciated the navigation system and found the app easy to use. 
9302,2,"More than three-quarters of the study participants found the app content relevant, concise, and comprehensive. "
9303,2,"The aesthetics and the engagement of the app were also appreciated (uMARS score, 3.7). "
9304,2,"Overall, 80% (42/52) of the study participants declared that the app helped them to become aware of the importance of addressing health behavior, and 65% (34/52) said that the app helped motivate them to change lifestyle habits."
9305,3,The app assessed the risky behaviors of the patients and delivered personalized recommendations and digital health interventions for multiple risk factors. 
9306,3,"The quality of the app was considered to be good, but the impact of the app on behavior changes is yet to be demonstrated and will be assessed in further studies."
9307,4,A New Remote Guided Method for Supervised Web-Based Cognitive Testing to Ensure High-Quality Data: Development and Usability Study
9308,0,The global COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a fundamental reexamination of how human psychological research can be conducted safely and robustly in a new era of digital working and physical distancing. 
9309,0,Online web-based testing has risen to the forefront as a promising solution for the rapid mass collection of cognitive data without requiring human contact. 
9310,0,"However, a long-standing debate exists over the data quality and validity of web-based studies. "
9311,0,This study examines the opportunities and challenges afforded by the societal shift toward web-based testing and highlights an urgent need to establish a standard data quality assurance framework for online studies.
9312,1,"A total of 85 healthy young adults were tested on 10 cognitive tasks assessing executive functioning (flexibility, memory, and inhibition) and learning. "
9313,1,"Tasks were administered either face-to-face in the laboratory (n=41) or online using remote guided testing (n=44) and delivered using identical web-based platforms (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, Inquisit, and i-ABC). "
9314,1,"Data quality was assessed using detailed trial-level measures (missed trials, outlying and excluded responses, and response times) and overall task performance measures."
9315,2,"The results indicated that, across all data quality and performance measures, RGT data was statistically-equivalent to in-person data collected in the lab (P .40 for all comparisons). "
9316,2,"Moreover, RGT participants out-performed the lab group on measured verbal intelligence (P<.001), which could reflect test environment differences, including possible effects of mask-wearing on communication."
9317,3,These data suggest that the RGT methodology could help ameliorate concerns regarding online data quality-particularly for studies involving high-risk or rare cohorts-and offer an alternative for collecting high-quality human cognitive data without requiring in-person physical attendance.
9318,4,Comparing the Effects of Gamification and Teach-Back Training Methods on Adherence to a Therapeutic Regimen in Patients After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery: Randomized Clinical Trial
9319,0,Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS) may fail to adhere to their treatment regimen for many reasons. 
9320,0,"Among these, one of the most important reasons for nonadherence is the inadequate training of such patients or training using inappropriate methods."
9321,1,"This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 123 patients undergoing CABGS in Tehran, Iran, in 2019. "
9322,1,Training was provided to the teach-back group individually. 
9323,1,"In the gamification group, an app developed for the purpose was installed on each patient's smartphone, with training given via this device. "
9324,1,"The control group received usual care, or routine training. "
9325,1,Adherence to the therapeutic regimen was assessed using a questionnaire on adherence to a therapeutic regimen (physical activity and dietary regimen) and an adherence scale as a pretest and a 1-month posttest.
9326,2,"One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for comparing the mean scores of teach-back and gamification training methods showed that the mean normalized scores for the dietary regimen (P<.001, F=71.80), movement regimen (P<.001, F=124.53), and medication regimen (P<.001, F=9.66) before and after intervention were significantly different between the teach-back, gamification, and control groups. "
9327,2,"In addition, the results of the Dunnett test showed that the teach-back and gamification groups were significantly different from the control group in all three treatment regimen methods. "
9328,2,There was no statistically significant difference in adherence to the therapeutic regimen between the teach-back and control groups.
9329,3,"Based on the results of this study, the use of teach-back and gamification training approaches may be suggested for patients after CABGS to facilitate adherence to the therapeutic regimen."
9330,4,A Theory- and Evidence-Based Digital Intervention Tool for Weight Loss Maintenance (NoHoW Toolkit): Systematic Development and Refinement Study
9331,0,"Many weight loss programs show short-term effectiveness, but subsequent weight loss maintenance is difficult to achieve. "
9332,0,Digital technologies offer a promising means of delivering behavior change approaches at low costs and on a wide scale. 
9333,0,"The Navigating to a Healthy Weight (NoHoW) project, which was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, aimed to develop, test, and evaluate a digital toolkit designed to promote successful long-term weight management. "
9334,0,"The toolkit was tested in an 18-month, large-scale, international, 2X2 factorial (motivation and self-regulation vs emotion regulation) randomized controlled trial that was conducted on adults with overweight or obesity who lost >= 5% of their body weight in the preceding 12 months before enrollment into the intervention."
9335,1,"The toolkit was developed by using a systematic approach, which included the development of the theory-based logic models, the selection of behavior change techniques, the translation of these techniques into a web-based app (NoHoW Toolkit components), technical development, and the user evaluation and refinement of the toolkit."
9336,2,"The toolkit included a set of web-based tools and inputs from digital tracking devices (smart scales and activity trackers) and modules that targeted weight, physical activity, and dietary behaviors. "
9337,2,The final toolkit comprised 34 sessions that were distributed through 15 modules and provided active content over a 4-month period. 
9338,2,"The motivation and self-regulation arm consisted of 8 modules (17 sessions), the emotion regulation arm was presented with 7 modules (17 sessions), and the combined arm received the full toolkit (15 modules; 34 sessions). "
9339,2,"The sessions included a range of implementations, such as videos, testimonies, and questionnaires Furthermore, the toolkit contained 5 specific data tiles for monitoring weight, steps, healthy eating, mood, and sleep."
9340,3,"A systematic approach to the development of digital solutions based on theory, evidence, and user testing may significantly contribute to the advancement of the science of behavior change and improve current solutions for sustained weight management. "
9341,3,"Testing the toolkit by using a 2 x2 design provided a unique opportunity to examine the effect of motivation and self-regulation and emotion regulation separately, as well as the effect of their interaction in weight loss maintenance."
9342,4,A Novel Deep Learning-Based System for Triage in the Emergency Department Using Electronic Medical Records: Retrospective Cohort Study
9343,0,Emergency department (ED) crowding has resulted in delayed patient treatment and has become a universal health care problem. 
9344,0,"Although a triage system, such as the 5-level emergency severity index, somewhat improves the process of ED treatment, it still heavily relies on the nurse's subjective judgment and triages too many patients to emergency severity index level 3 in current practice. "
9345,0,"Hence, a system that can help clinicians accurately triage a patient's condition is imperative."
9346,1,We conducted a retrospective study using data from an open data set from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2012 to 2016 and data from a local data set from the National Taiwan University Hospital from 2009 to 2015. 
9347,1,"In this study, we transformed structured data into text form and used convolutional neural networks combined with recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms to accomplish the classification task. "
9348,1,We evaluated our performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
9349,2,"A total of 118,602 patients from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were included in this study for predicting hospitalization, and the accuracy and AUROC were 0.83 and 0.87, respectively. "
9350,2,"On the other hand, an external experiment was to use our own data set from the National Taiwan University Hospital that included 745,441 patients, where the accuracy and AUROC were similar, that is, 0.83 and 0.88, respectively. "
9351,2,"Moreover, to effectively evaluate the prediction quality of our proposed system, we also applied the model to other clinical outcomes, including mortality and admission to the intensive care unit, and the results showed that our proposed method was approximately 3% to 5% higher in accuracy than other conventional methods."
9352,3,"Our proposed method achieved better performance than the traditional method, and its implementation is relatively easy, it includes commonly used variables, and it is better suited for real-world clinical settings. "
9353,3,"It is our future work to validate our novel deep learning-based triage algorithm with prospective clinical trials, and we hope to use it to guide resource allocation in a busy ED once the validation succeeds."
9354,4,Use of Patient-Repor ted Outcome Measures and Patient-Repor ted Experience Measures Within Evaluation Studies of Telemedicine Applications: Systematic Review
9355,0,"With the rise of digital health technologies and telemedicine, the need for evidence-based evaluation is growing. "
9356,0,Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are recommended as an essential part of the evaluation of telemedicine. 
9357,0,"For the first time, a systematic review has been conducted to investigate the use of PROMs and PREMs in the evaluation studies of telemedicine covering all application types and medical purposes."
9358,1,"We conducted a systematic literature search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases and included studies published from inception until April 2, 2020. "
9359,1,"We included studies evaluating telemedicine with patients as the main users; these studies reported PROMs and PREMs within randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, noncontrolled trials, and feasibility trials in English and German."
9360,2,"Of the identified 2671 studies, 303 (11.34%) were included; of the 303 studies, 67 (22.1%) were feasibility studies, 70 (23.1%) were noncontrolled trials, 20 (6.6%) were controlled trials, and 146 (48.2%) were randomized controlled trials. "
9361,2,"Health-related quality of life (n=310; mean 1.02, SD 1.05), emotional function (n=244; mean 0.81, SD 1.18), and adherence (n=103; mean 0.34, SD 0.53) were the most frequently assessed outcome domains. "
9362,2,"Self-developed PROMs were used in 21.4% (65/303) of the studies, and self-developed PREMs were used in 22.3% (68/303). "
9363,2,PROMs (n=884) were assessed more frequently than PREMs (n=234). 
9364,2,"As the evidence level of the studies increased, the number of PROMs also increased (t=-0.45), and the number of PREMs decreased (t=0.35). "
9365,2,"Since 2000, not only has the number of studies using PROMs and PREMs increased, but the level of evidence and the number of outcome measurement instruments used have also increased, with the number of PREMs permanently remaining at a lower level."
9366,3,"There have been increasingly more studies, particularly high-evidence studies, which use PROMs and PREMs to evaluate telemedicine. "
9367,3,PROMs have been used more frequently than PREMs. 
9368,3,"With the increasing maturity stage of telemedicine applications and higher evidence level, the use of PROMs increased in line with the recommendations of evaluation guidelines. "
9369,3,Health-related quality of life and emotional function were measured in almost all the studies. 
9370,3,"Simultaneously, health literacy as a precondition for using the application adequately, alongside proper training and guidance, has rarely been reported. "
9371,3,Further efforts should be pursued to standardize PROM and PREM collection in evaluation studies of telemedicine.
9372,4,"Benefits, Problems, and Potential Improvements in a Nationwide Patient Portal: Cross-sectional Survey of Pharmacy Customers Experiences"
9373,0,Patient engagement is a worldwide trend in health care. 
9374,0,Patient portals have the potential to increase patients' knowledge about their health and care and therefore enhance patient engagement. 
9375,0,Portal users' experiences are needed to determine if these portals work appropriately and if there are barriers to achieving the aims that were set before their implementation.
9376,1,A questionnaire survey was conducted among pharmacy customers in the spring of 2019. 
9377,1,The questionnaires (N=2866) were distributed from 18 community pharmacies across mainland Finland to customers aged >= 18 years who were purchasing prescription medicines for themselves or their children aged <18 years. 
9378,1,"Using open-ended questions, customers were asked about their experiences of the benefits and problems of My Kanta and what improvements could be made. "
9379,1,"Their responses were encoded and categorized using inductive content analysis, stored in SPSS Statistics for Windows, and analyzed using frequencies."
9380,2,"Of the 2866 questionnaires, a total of 994 (34.68%) questionnaires were included in the analysis. "
9381,2,"Most respondents were My Kanta users (820/994, 82.5%); of these 820 users, 667 (81.3%) reported at least one benefit, 311 (37.9%) reported at least one problem, and 327 (39.9%) reported at least one potential improvement when using My Kanta The most commonly mentioned benefits were opportunities to view health data (290/667, 43.5%) and prescriptions (247/667, 37%) and to renew prescriptions (220/667, 33%). "
9382,2,"The most extensively reported problems with My Kanta were that the portal lacks health data (71/311, 22.8%), navigating the service and searching for information is difficult (68/311, 21.9%), and the delay before health data are incorporated into the service (41/311, 13.2%). "
9383,2,"The most frequently suggested potential improvements were that My Kanta needs more comprehensive health data (89/327, 27.2%); the service should be easier to navigate and information easier to access (71/327, 21.7%); the service should have more functions (51/327, 15.6%); and health data should be entered into the portal more promptly (47/327, 14.4%)."
9384,3,Pharmacy customers reported more benefits than problems or potential improvements regarding the use of My Kanta The service is useful for viewing health data and prescriptions and for renewing prescriptions. 
9385,3,"However, portal users would like to see more data and functions available in the portal and data searches to be made easier. "
9386,3,These improvements could make the data and functions provided by the portal easier to view and use and hence promote patient engagement.
9387,4,"Multiple Sclerosis Progression Discussion Tool Usability and Usefulness in Clinical Practice: Cross-sectional, Web-Based Survey"
9388,0,"A digital tool, Multiple Sclerosis Progression Discussion Tool (MSProDiscuss), was developed to facilitate discussions between health care professionals (HCPs) and patients in evaluating early, subtle signs of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease progression."
9389,1,"In this cross-sectional, web-based survey, HCPs across 34 countries completed an initial individual questionnaire (comprising 7 questions on comprehensibility, usability, and usefulness after using MSProDiscuss during each patient consultation) and a final questionnaire (comprising 13 questions on comprehensibility, usability, usefulness, and integration and adoption into clinical practice to capture the HCPs' overall experience of using the tool). "
9390,1,The responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale. 
9391,1,"All analyses were descriptive, and no statistical comparisons were made."
9392,2,"In total, 301 HCPs tested the tool in 6974 people with MS, of whom 77% (5370/6974) had relapsing-remitting MS, including those suspected to be transitioning to secondary progressive MS. "
9393,2,The time taken to complete MSProDiscuss was reported to be in the range of 1 to 4 minutes in 97.3% (6786/6974; initial) to 98.2% (269/274; final) of the cases. 
9394,2,"In 93.54% (6524/6974; initial) to 97.1% (266/274; final) of the cases, the HCPs agreed (4 or 5 on the Likert scale) that patients were able to comprehend the questions in the tool. "
9395,2,"The HCPs were willing to use the tool again in the same patient, 90.47% (6310/6974; initial) of the cases. "
9396,2,"The HCPs reported MSProDiscuss to be useful in discussing MS symptoms and their impact on daily activities (6121/6974, 87.76% initial and 252/274, 92% final) and cognitive function (5482/6974, 78.61% initial and 271/274, 79.2% final), as well as in discussing progression in general (6102/6974, 87.49% initial and 246/274, 89.8% final). "
9397,2,"While completing the final questionnaire, 94.9% (260/274) of the HCPs agreed that the questions were similar to those asked in regular consultation, and the tool helped to better understand the impact of MS symptoms on daily activities (249/274, 90.9%) and cognitive function (220/274, 80.3%). "
9398,2,"Overall, 92% (252/274) of the HCPs reported that they would recommend MSProDiscuss to a colleague, and 85.8% (235/274) were willing to integrate it into their clinical practice."
9399,3,MSProDiscuss is a usable and useful tool to facilitate a physician-patient discussion on MS disease progression in daily clinical practice. 
9400,3,Most of the HCPs agreed that the tool is easy to use and were willing to integrate MSProDiscuss into their daily clinical practice.
9401,4,Improvement and Evaluation of the TOPCOP Taxonomy of Patient Portals: Taxonomy-Evaluation-Delphi (TED) Approach
9402,0,"Patient portals have been introduced in many countries over the last 10 years, but many health information managers still feel they have too little knowledge of patient portals. "
9403,0,A taxonomy can help them to better compare and select portals. 
9404,0,This has led us to develop the TOPCOP taxonomy for classifying and comparing patient portals. 
9405,0,"However, the taxonomy has not been evaluated by users."
9406,1,We used a modified Delphi approach. 
9407,1,We sampled a heterogeneous panel of 13 health information managers from 3 countries using the criterion sampling strategy. 
9408,1,We conducted 4 anonymous survey rounds with qualitative and quantitative questions. 
9409,1,"In round 1, the panelists assessed the appropriateness of each dimension, and we collected new ideas to improve the dimensions. "
9410,1,"In rounds 2 and 3, the panelists iteratively evaluated the taxonomy that was revised based on round 1. "
9411,1,"In round 4, the panelists assessed the need for a taxonomy and the appropriateness of patient engagement as a distinguishing concept. "
9412,1,"Then, they compared 2 real portals with the final taxonomy and evaluated its usefulness for comparing portals, creating an initial requirement profile, and selecting patient portals. "
9413,1,"To determine group consensus, we applied the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method."
9414,2,The final taxonomy consists of 25 dimensions with 65 characteristics. 
9415,2,"Five new dimensions were added to the original taxonomy, with 8 characteristics added to already existing dimensions. "
9416,2,"Group consensus was achieved on the need for such a taxonomy to compare portals, on patient engagement as an appropriate distinguishing concept, and on the comprehensibility of the taxonomy's form. "
9417,2,"Further, consensus was achieved on the taxonomy's usefulness for classifying and comparing portals, assisting users in better understanding portals, creating a requirement profile, and selecting portals. "
9418,2,This allowed us to test the usefulness of the final taxonomy with the intended users.
9419,3,The TOPCOP taxonomy aims to support health information managers in comparing and selecting patient portals. 
9420,3,"By providing a standardized terminology to describe various aspects of patient portals independent of clinical setting or country, the taxonomy will also be useful for advancing research and evaluation of patient portals."
9421,4,Columbia Open Health Data for COVID-19 Research: Database Analysis
9422,0,COVID-19 has threatened the health of tens of millions of people all over the world. 
9423,0,Massive research efforts have been made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
9424,0,Utilization of clinical data can accelerate these research efforts to combat the pandemic since important characteristics of the patients are often found by examining the clinical data. 
9425,0,"Publicly accessible clinical data on COVID-19, however, remain limited despite the immediate need."
9426,1,The data used in COHD-COVID were obtained from NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center's electronic health records database. 
9427,1,"Condition, drug, and procedure concepts were obtained from the visits of identified patients from the cohorts. "
9428,1,"Rare concepts were excluded, and the true concept counts were perturbed using Poisson randomization to protect patient privacy. "
9429,1,"Concept prevalence, concept prevalence ratio, concept co-occurrence, and symptom prevalence were calculated using the obtained concepts."
9430,2,"Concept prevalence and concept prevalence ratio analyses showed the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 cohorts, confirming the well-known characteristics of COVID-19 (eg, acute lower respiratory tract infection and cough). "
9431,2,The concepts related to the well-known characteristics of COVID-19 recorded high prevalence and high prevalence ratio in the COVID-19 cohort compared to the hospitalized influenza cohort and general hospitalized cohort. 
9432,2,Concept co-occurrence analyses showed potential associations between specific concepts. 
9433,2,"In case of acute lower respiratory tract infection in the COVID-19 cohort, a high co-occurrence ratio was obtained with COVID-19-related concepts and commonly used drugs (eg, disease due to coronavirus and acetaminophen). "
9434,2,"Symptom prevalence analysis indicated symptom-level characteristics of the cohorts and confirmed that well-known symptoms of COVID-19 (eg, fever, cough, and dyspnea) showed higher prevalence than the hospitalized influenza cohort and the general hospitalized cohort."
9435,3,"We present COHD-COVID, a publicly accessible database providing useful clinical data for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, hospitalized patients with influenza, and general hospitalized patients. "
9436,3,We expect COHD-COVID to provide researchers and clinicians quantitative measures of COVID-19-related clinical features to better understand and combat the pandemic.
9437,4,Predicting Norovirus in the United States Using Google Trends: Infodemiology Study
9438,0,Norovirus is a contagious disease. 
9439,0,The transmission of norovirus spreads quickly and easily in various ways. 
9440,0,"Because effective methods to prevent or treat norovirus have not been discovered, it is important to rapidly recognize and report norovirus outbreaks in the early phase. "
9441,0,Internet search has been a useful method for people to access information immediately. 
9442,0,"With the precise record of internet search trends, internet search has been a useful tool to manifest infectious disease outbreaks."
9443,1,The internet search trend data of norovirus were obtained from Google Trends. 
9444,1,We used cross-correlation analysis to discover the temporal correlation between norovirus and other terms. 
9445,1,We also used multiple linear regression with the stepwise method to recognize the most important predictors of internet search trends and norovirus. 
9446,1,"In addition, we evaluated the temporal correlation between actual norovirus cases and internet search terms in New York, California, and the United States as a whole."
9447,2,"Some Google search terms such as gastroenteritis, watery diarrhea, and stomach bug coincided with norovirus Google Trends. "
9448,2,"Some Google search terms such as contagious, travel, and party presented earlier than norovirus Google Trends. "
9449,2,"Some Google search terms such as dehydration, bar, and coronavirus presented several months later than norovirus Google Trends. "
9450,2,"We found that fever, gastroenteritis, poison, cruise, wedding, and watery diarrhea were important factors correlated with norovirus Google Trends. "
9451,2,"In actual norovirus cases from New York, California, and the United States as a whole, some Google search terms presented with, earlier, or later than actual norovirus cases."
9452,3,Our study provides novel strategy-based internet search evidence regarding the epidemiology of norovirus.
9453,4,An Ostomy Self-management Telehealth Intervention for Cancer Survivors: Technology-Related Findings From a Randomized Controlled Trial
9454,0,An Ostomy Self-management Telehealth (OSMT) intervention by nurse educators and peer ostomates can equip new ostomates with critical knowledge regarding ostomy care. 
9455,0,"A telehealth technology assessment aim was to measure telehealth engineer support requirements for telehealth technology-related (TTR) incidents encountered during OSMT intervention sessions held via a secure cloud-based videoconferencing service, Zoom for Healthcare."
9456,1,"The Arizona Telemedicine Program provided telehealth engineering support for 105 OSMT sessions, scheduled for 90 to 120 minutes each, over a 2-year period. "
9457,1,"The OSMT groups included up to 15 participants, comprising 4-6 ostomates, 4-6 peer ostomates, 2 nurse educators, and 1 telehealth engineer. "
9458,1,OSMT-session TTR incidents were recorded contemporaneously in detailed notes by the research staff. 
9459,1,TTR incidents were categorized and tallied.
9460,2,A total of 97.1% (102/105) OSMT sessions were completed as scheduled. 
9461,2,"In total, 3 OSMT sessions were not held owing to non-technology-related reasons. "
9462,2,"Of the 93 ostomates who participated in OSMT sessions, 80 (86%) completed their OSMT curriculum. "
9463,2,TTR incidents occurred in 36.3% (37/102) of the completed sessions with varying disruptive impacts. 
9464,2,No sessions were canceled or rescheduled because of TTR incidents. 
9465,2,Disruptions from TTR incidents were minimized by following the TTR incident prevention and incident response plans.
9466,3,Telehealth videoconferencing technology can enable ostomates to participate in ostomy self-management education by incorporating dedicated telehealth engineering support. 
9467,3,"Potentially, OSMT greatly expands the availability of ostomy self-management education for new ostomates."
9468,4,"Facilitator Contact, Discussion Boards, and Virtual Badges as Adherence Enhancements to a Web-Based, Self-guided, Positive Psychological Intervention for Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial"
9469,0,"Adherence to self-guided interventions tends to be very low, especially in people with depression. "
9470,0,"Prior studies have demonstrated that enhancements may increase adherence, but little is known about the efficacy of various enhancements in comparison to, or in combination with, one another."
9471,1,"Participants were recruited through web-based sources and, after completing at least 4 out of 7 daily emotion reports, were sequentially assigned to 1 of 9 conditions-the intervention alone; the intervention plus 1, 2, or all 3 enhancements; or an emotion reporting control condition. "
9472,1,"The intervention was a positive psychological program consisting of 8 skills that specifically targeted positive emotions, and it was delivered over 5 weeks in a self-guided, web-based format. "
9473,1,We operationalized adherence as the number of skills accessed.
9474,2,A total of 602 participants were enrolled in this study. 
9475,2,"Participants accessed, on average, 5.61 (SD 2.76) of 8 skills. "
9476,2,The total number of enhancements participants received (0-3) did not predict the number of skills accessed. 
9477,2,Participants who were assigned to the VB+FC condition accessed significantly more skills than those in the intervention only conditions. 
9478,2,"Furthermore, participants in arms that received the combination of both the VB and FC enhancements (VB+FC and VB+FC+online discussion board) accessed a greater number of skills relative to the number of skills accessed by participants who received either VB or FC without the other. "
9479,2,Moderation analyses revealed that the receipt of VB (vs no VB) predicted higher adherence among participants with moderately severe depression at baseline.
9480,3,"The results suggested that the VB+FC combination significantly increased the number of skills accessed in a self-guided, web-based intervention for elevated depression. "
9481,3,"We have provided suggestions for refinements to these enhancements, which may further improve adherence."
9482,4,Determinants of the Use of Health and Fitness Mobile Apps by Patients With Asthma: Secondary Analysis of Observational Studies
9483,0,Health and fitness apps have potential benefits to improve self-management and disease control among patients with asthma. 
9484,0,"However, inconsistent use rates have been reported across studies, regions, and health systems. "
9485,0,"A better understanding of the characteristics of users and nonusers is critical to design solutions that are effectively integrated in patients' daily lives, and to ensure that these equitably reach out to different groups of patients, thus improving rather than entrenching health inequities."
9486,1,A secondary analysis of the INSPIRERS observational studies was conducted using data from face-to-face visits. 
9487,1,Patients with a diagnosis of asthma were included between November 2017 and August 2020. 
9488,1,"Individual-level data were collected, including age, gender, marital status, educational level, health status, presence of anxiety and depression, postcode, socioeconomic level, digital literacy, use of health services, and use of health and fitness apps. "
9489,1,Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the probability of being a health and fitness app user. 
9490,1,Statistical analysis was performed in R.
9491,2,A total of 526 patients attended a face-to-face visit in the 49 recruiting centers and 514 had complete data. 
9492,2,"Most participants were <= 40 years old (66.4%), had at least 10 years of education (57.4%), and were in the 3 higher quintiles of the socioeconomic deprivation index (70.1%). "
9493,2,"The majority reported an overall good health status (visual analogue scale [VAS] score>70 in 93.1%) and the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 34.3% and 11.9%, respectively. "
9494,2,The proportion of participants who reported using health and fitness mobile apps was 41.1% (n=211). 
9495,2,"Multivariate models revealed that single individuals and those with more than 10 years of education are more likely to use health and fitness mobile apps (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.22, 95%CI 1.05-4.75 and aOR 1.95, 95%CI 1.12-3.45, respectively). "
9496,2,"Higher digital literacy scores were also associated with higher odds of being a user of health and fitness apps, with participants in the second, third, and fourth quartiles reporting aORs of 6.74 (95%CI 2.90-17.40), 10.30 (95%CI 4.28-27.56), and 11.52 (95%CI 4.78-30.87), respectively. "
9497,2,"Participants with depression symptoms had lower odds of using health and fitness apps (aOR 0.32, 95%CI 0.12-0.83)."
9498,3,"A better understanding of the barriers and enhancers of app use among patients with lower education, lower digital literacy, or depressive symptoms is key to design tailored interventions to ensure a sustained and equitable use of these technologies. "
9499,3,Future studies should also assess users' general health-seeking behavior and their interest and concerns specifically about digital tools. 
9500,3,These factors may impact both initial engagement and sustained use.
9501,4,Assessing Patient Needs During Natural Disasters: Mixed Methods Analysis of Portal Messages Sent During Hurricane Harvey
9502,0,"Patient portals play an important role in connecting patients with their medical care team, which improves patient engagement in treatment plans, decreases unnecessary visits, and reduces costs. "
9503,0,"During natural disasters, patients' needs increase, whereas available resources, specifically access to care, become limited."
9504,1,"We explored patient portal use data from a large Greater Houston area health care system focusing on the initial week of the Hurricane Harvey disaster, beginning with the date of landfall, August 25, 2017, to August 31, 2017. "
9505,1,A mixed methods approach was used to assess patients' immediate health needs and concerns during the disruption of access to routine and emergent medical care. 
9506,1,Quantitative analysis used logistic regression models to assess the predictive characteristics of patients using the portal during Hurricane Harvey. 
9507,1,"This study also included encounters by type (emergency, inpatient, observation, outpatient, and outpatient surgery) and time (before, during, and after Hurricane Harvey). "
9508,1,"For qualitative analysis, the content of these messages was examined using the constant comparative method to identify emerging themes found within the message texts."
9509,2,"Out of a total of 557,024 patients, 4079 (0.73%) sent a message during Hurricane Harvey, whereas 31,737 (5.69%) used the portal. "
9510,2,"Age, sex, race, and ethnicity were predictive factors for using the portal and sending a message during the natural disaster. "
9511,2,"We found that prior use of the patient portal increased the likelihood of portal use during Hurricane Harvey (odds ratio 13.688, 95% CI 12.929-14.491) and of sending a portal message during the disaster (odds ratio 14.172, 95% CI 11.879-16.907). "
9512,2,Having an encounter 4 weeks before or after Hurricane Harvey was positively associated with increased use of the portal and sending a portal message. 
9513,2,Patients with encounters during the main Hurricane Harvey week had a higher increased likelihood of portal use across all five encounter types. 
9514,2,"Qualitative themes included: access, prescription requests, medical advice (chronic conditions, acute care, urgent needs, and Hurricane Harvey-related injuries), mental health, technical difficulties, and provider constraints."
9515,3,The patient portal can be a useful tool for communication between patients and providers to address the urgent needs and concerns of patients as a natural disaster unfolds. 
9516,3,This was the first known study to include encounter data to understand portal use compared with care provisioning. 
9517,3,Prior use was predictive of both portal use and message sending during Hurricane Harvey. 
9518,3,These findings could inform the types of demands that may arise in future disaster situations and can serve as the first step in intentionally optimizing patient portal usability for emergency health care management during natural disasters.
9519,4,Exploring Changes to the Actionability of COVID-19 Dashboards Over the Course of 2020 in the Canadian Context: Descriptive Assessment and Expert Appraisal Study
9520,0,Public web-based COVID-19 dashboards are in use worldwide to communicate pandemic-related information. 
9521,0,"Actionability of dashboards, as a predictor of their potential use for data-driven decision-making, was assessed in a global study during the early stages of the pandemic. "
9522,0,It revealed a widespread lack of features needed to support actionability. 
9523,0,"In view of the inherently dynamic nature of dashboards and their unprecedented speed of creation, the evolution of dashboards and changes to their actionability merit exploration."
9524,1,"We conducted a descriptive assessment of a pan-Canadian sample of COVID-19 dashboards (N=26), followed by an appraisal of changes to their actionability by a panel of expert scorers (N=8). "
9525,1,"Scorers assessed the dashboards at two points in time, July and November 2020, using an assessment tool informed by communication theory and health care performance intelligence. "
9526,1,"Applying the nominal group technique, scorers were grouped in panels of three, and evaluated the presence of the seven defined features of highly actionable dashboards at each time point."
9527,2,Improvements had been made to the dashboards over time. 
9528,2,"These predominantly involved data provision (specificity of geographic breakdowns, range of indicators reported, and explanations of data sources or calculations) and advancements enabled by the technologies employed (customization of time trends and interactive or visual chart elements). "
9529,2,"Further improvements in actionability were noted especially in features involving local-level data provision, time-trend reporting, and indicator management. "
9530,2,"No improvements were found in communicative elements (clarity of purpose and audience), while the use of storytelling techniques to narrate trends remained largely absent from the dashboards."
9531,3,Improvements to COVID-19 dashboards in the Canadian context during 2020 were seen mostly in data availability and dashboard technology. 
9532,3,Further improving the actionability of dashboards for public reporting will require attention to both technical and organizational aspects of dashboard development. 
9533,3,"Such efforts would include better skill-mixing across disciplines, continued investment in data standards, and clearer mandates for their developers to ensure accountability and the development of purpose-driven dashboards."
9534,4,Recursive Partitioning vs Computerized Adaptive Testing to Reduce the Burden of Health Assessments in Cleft Lip and/or Palate: Comparative Simulation Study
9535,0,"Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has been shown to deliver short, accurate, and personalized versions of the CLEFT-Q patient-reported outcome measure for children and young adults born with a cleft lip and/or palate. "
9536,0,"Decision trees may integrate clinician-reported data (eg, age, gender, cleft type, and planned treatments) to make these assessments even shorter and more accurate."
9537,1,We used relevant clinician-reported data and patient-reported item responses from the CLEFT-Q field test to train and test decision tree models using recursive partitioning. 
9538,1,We compared the prediction accuracy of decision trees to CAT assessments of similar length. 
9539,1,Participant scores from the full-length questionnaire were used as ground truth. 
9540,1,"Accuracy was assessed through Pearson's correlation coefficient of predicted and ground truth scores, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing squared error."
9541,2,Decision trees demonstrated poorer accuracy than CAT comparators and generally made data splits based on item responses rather than clinician-reported data.
9542,3,"When predicting CLEFT-Q scores, individual item responses are generally more informative than clinician-reported data. "
9543,3,Decision trees that make binary splits are at risk of underfitting polytomous patient-reported outcome measure data and demonstrated poorer performance than CATs in this study.
9544,4,Characteristics of the Measurement Tools for Assessing Health Information-Seeking Behaviors in Nationally Representative Surveys: Systematic Review
9545,0,"The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has also emerged as an infodemic, thereby worsening the harm of the pandemic. "
9546,0,This situation has highlighted the need for a deeply rooted understanding of the health information-seeking behaviors (HISBs) of people.
9547,1,The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was used as the framework for this study. 
9548,1,A data search was performed through 5 international and 2 Korean databases covering the years between 2008 and 2020. 
9549,1,"Initially, studies performed among nationally representative samples were included to discover HISB survey instruments. "
9550,1,The methodologies of the studies using HISB surveys were analyzed. 
9551,1,"For content analysis, 2 researchers reached a consensus through discussion by scrutinizing the contents of each survey questionnaire."
9552,2,A total of 13 survey tools from 8 countries were identified after a review of 2333 records from the search results. 
9553,2,"Five survey tools (Health Information National Trends Survey, Health Tracking Survey, Annenberg National Health Communication Survey, National Health Interview Survey, and Health Tracking Household Survey) from the United States, 2 instruments from Germany, and 1 tool from each of the countries of the European Union, France, Israel, Poland, South Korea, and Taiwan were identified. "
9554,2,Telephone or web-based surveys were commonly used targeting the adult population (>= 15 years of age). 
9555,2,"From the content analysis, the domains of the survey items were categorized as follows: information (information about health and patient medical records), channel (offline and online), and health (overall health, lifestyle, and cancer). "
9556,2,All categories encompassed behavioral and attitude dimensions. 
9557,2,"A theoretical framework, that is, an information-channel-health structure for HISBs was proposed."
9558,3,The results of our study can contribute to the development and implementation of the survey tools for HISB with integrated questionnaire items. 
9559,3,This will help in understanding HISB trends in national health care.
9560,4,A Multicomponent mHealth-Based Intervention (SWAP IT) to Decrease the Consumption of Discretionary Foods Packed in School Lunchboxes: Type I Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial
9561,0,There is significant opportunity to improve the nutritional quality of foods packed in children's school lunchboxes. 
9562,0,Interventions that are effective and scalable targeting the school and home environment are therefore warranted.
9563,1,"A type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 32 primary schools located across 3 local health districts in New South Wales, Australia, to compare the effects of a 6-month intervention targeting foods packed in children's lunchboxes with those of a usual care control. "
9564,1,Primary schools were eligible if they were not participating in other nutrition studies and used the required school communication app. 
9565,1,"The Behaviour Change Wheel was used to co-design the multicomponent SWAP IT intervention, which consisted of the following: school lunchbox nutrition guidelines, curriculum lessons, information pushed to parents digitally via an existing school communication app, and additional parent resources to address common barriers to packing healthy lunchboxes. "
9566,1,"The primary outcome, mean energy (kilojoules) content of discretionary lunchbox foods and drinks packed in lunchboxes, was measured via observation using a validated school food checklist at baseline (May 2019) and at 6-month follow-up (October 2019). "
9567,1,"Additional secondary outcomes included mean lunchbox energy from discretionary foods consumed, mean total lunchbox energy packed and consumed, mean energy content of core lunchbox foods packed and consumed, and percentage of lunchbox energy from discretionary and core foods, all of which were also measured via observation using a validated school food checklist. "
9568,1,"Measures of school engagement, consumption of discretionary foods outside of school hours, and lunchbox cost were also collected at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. "
9569,1,"Data were analyzed via hierarchical linear regression models, with controlling for clustering, socioeconomic status, and remoteness."
9570,2,"A total of 3022 (3022/7212, 41.90%) students consented to participate in the evaluation (mean age 7.8 years; 1487/3022, 49.22% girls). "
9571,2,"There were significant reductions between the intervention and control groups in the primary trial outcome, mean energy (kilojoules) content of discretionary foods packed in lunchboxes (-117.26 kJ; 95% CI -195.59 to -39.83; P=.003). "
9572,2,"Relative to the control, the intervention also significantly reduced secondary outcomes regarding the mean total lunchbox energy (kilojoules) packed (-88.38 kJ; 95% CI -172.84 to -3.92; P=.04) and consumed (-117.17 kJ; 95% CI -233.72 to -0.62; P=.05). "
9573,2,"There was no significant difference between groups in measures of student engagement, consumption of discretionary foods outside of school hours, or cost of foods packed in children's lunchboxes."
9574,3,The SWAP IT intervention was effective in reducing the energy content of foods packed for and consumed by primary school-aged children at school. 
9575,3,"Dissemination of the SWAP IT program at a population level has the potential to influence a significant proportion of primary school-aged children, impacting weight status and associated health care costs."
9576,4,Exploratory Outlier Detection for Acceleromyographic Neuromuscular Monitoring: Machine Learning Approach
9577,0,Perioperative quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular function in patients receiving neuromuscular blockers has become internationally recognized as an absolute and core necessity in modern anesthesia care. 
9578,0,"Because of their kinetic nature, artifactual recordings of acceleromyography-based neuromuscular monitoring devices are not unusual. "
9579,0,"These generate a great deal of cynicism among anesthesiologists, constituting an obstacle toward their widespread adoption. "
9580,0,"Through outlier analysis techniques, monitoring devices can learn to detect and flag signal abnormalities. "
9581,0,Outlier analysis (or anomaly detection) refers to the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior.
9582,1,A data set encompassing 533 high-sensitivity TOF measurements from 35 patients was created based on a multicentric open label trial of a purpose-built accelero- and gyroscopic-based neuromuscular monitoring app. 
9583,1,A basic set of features was extracted based on raw data while a second set of features was purpose engineered based on TOF pattern characteristics. 
9584,1,Two cost-sensitive logistic regression (CSLR) models were deployed to evaluate the performance of these features. 
9585,1,"The final output of the developed models was a binary classification, indicating if a TOF measurement was an outlier or not."
9586,2,"A total of 7 basic features were extracted based on raw data, while another 8 features were engineered based on TOF pattern characteristics. "
9587,2,The model training and testing were based on separate data sets: one with 319 measurements (18 outliers) and a second with 214 measurements (12 outliers). 
9588,2,"The F1 score (95% CI) was 0.86 (0.48-0.97) for the CSLR model with engineered features, significantly larger than the CSLR model with the basic features (0.29 [0.17-0.53]; P<.001)."
9589,3,The set of engineered features and their corresponding incorporation in an outlier detection algorithm have the potential to increase overall neuromuscular monitoring data consistency. 
9590,3,Integrating outlier flagging algorithms within neuromuscular monitors could potentially reduce overall acceleromyography-based reliability issues.

9592,0,The COVID-19 pandemic has changed work life profoundly and concerns regarding the mental well-being of employees' have arisen. 
9593,0,Organizations have made rapid digital advancements and have started to use new collaborative tools such as social media platforms overnight.
9594,1,"Nationally representative longitudinal survey data were collected in 2019-2020, and 965 respondents participated in all 4 surveys. "
9595,1,"Measures included work engagement, perceived social support and task resources, and psychological distress. "
9596,1,The data were analyzed using a hybrid linear regression model.
9597,2,Work engagement remained stable and only decreased in autumn 2020. 
9598,2,"Within-person changes in social media communication at work, social support, task resources, and psychological distress were all associated with work engagement. "
9599,2,The negative association between psychological distress and work engagement was stronger in autumn 2020 than before the COVID-19 outbreak.
9600,3,The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted pressure on mental health at work. 
9601,3,Fostering social support and task resources at work is important in maintaining work engagement. 
9602,3,Social media communication could help maintain a supportive work environment.
9603,4,Medical Specialty Recommendations by an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot on a Smartphone: Development and Deployment
9604,0,The COVID-19 pandemic has limited daily activities and even contact between patients and primary care providers. 
9605,0,"This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services, which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. "
9606,0,A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients'symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution.
9607,1,"We collected 118,008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty), conducted data cleansing, and finally constructed a pipeline of 51,134 sentences for this study. "
9608,1,"Several deep learning models, including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer, as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP, were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. "
9609,1,"The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). "
9610,1,An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. 
9611,1,"We used an open-source framework called ""Alpha"" to develop our AI chatbot. "
9612,1,"This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones."
9613,2,"The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F-1-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F-1-score of 0.739. "
9614,2,"Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. "
9615,2,We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones.
9616,3,"With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning-based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. "
9617,3,"This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner, based on their symptoms, thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers."
9618,4,Long-term Effectiveness of mHealth Physical Activity Interventions: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
9619,0,"Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can increase physical activity (PA); however, their long-term impact is not well understood."
9620,1,We performed this study according to the Cochrane and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. 
9621,1,"We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, and PsycINFO in July 2020. "
9622,1,Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials of mHealth interventions targeting PA as a primary outcome in adults. 
9623,1,"Eligible outcome measures were walking, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), total physical activity (TPA), and energy expenditure. "
9624,1,"Where reported, we extracted data for 3 time points (ie, end of intervention, follow-up <= 6 months, and follow-up >6 months). "
9625,1,"To explore effect moderators, we performed subgroup analyses by population, intervention design, and control group type. "
9626,1,Results were summarized using random effects meta-analysis. 
9627,1,Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool.
9628,2,"Of the 2828 identified studies, 117 were included. "
9629,2,"These studies reported on 21,118 participants with a mean age of 52.03 (SD 14.14) years, of whom 58.99% (n=12,459) were female. "
9630,2,"mHealth interventions significantly increased PA across all the 4 outcome measures at the end of intervention (walking standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.46, 95% CI 0.36-0.55; P<.001; MVPA SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.21-0.35; P<.001; TPA SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.20-0.47; P<.001; energy expenditure SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.13-0.75; P=.01). "
9631,2,"Only 33 studies reported short-term follow-up measurements, and 8 studies reported long-term follow-up measurements in addition to end-of-intervention results. "
9632,2,"In the short term, effects were sustained for walking (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.42; P=.002), MVPA (SMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.35; P=.008), and TPA (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.13-0.93; P=.009). "
9633,2,"In the long term, effects were also sustained for walking (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.10-0.39; P=.001) and MVPA (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.11-0.27; P<.001). "
9634,2,"We found the study population to be an effect moderator, with higher effect scores in sick and at-risk populations. "
9635,2,PA was increased both in scalable and nonscalable mHealth intervention designs and regardless of the control group type. 
9636,2,The risk of bias was rated high in 80.3% (94/117) of the studies. 
9637,2,"Heterogeneity was significant, resulting in low to very low quality of evidence."
9638,3,mHealth interventions can foster small to moderate increases in PA. 
9639,3,"The effects are maintained long term; however, the effect size decreases over time. "
9640,3,The results encourage using mHealth interventions in at-risk and sick populations and support the use of scalable mHealth intervention designs to affordably reach large populations. 
9641,3,"However, given the low evidence quality, further methodologically rigorous studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects."
9642,4,"A Web-Based and In-Person Risk Reframing Intervention to Influence Mothers Tolerance for, and Parenting Practices Associated With, Childrens Outdoor Risky Play: Randomized Controlled Trial"
9643,0,"Outdoor risky play, such as climbing, racing, and independent exploration, is an important part of childhood and is associated with various positive physical, mental, and developmental outcomes for children. "
9644,0,"Parental attitudes and fears, particularly mothers', are a major deterrent to children's opportunities for outdoor risky play."
9645,1,The Go Play Outside! 
9646,1,randomized controlled trial was conducted in Canada from 2017 to 2018. 
9647,1,"Participants were recruited through social media, snowball sampling, and community notices. "
9648,1,"Mothers of children aged 6-12 years were self-assessed through eligibility questions, and those eligible and consented to participate in the study were randomized into a fully automated web-based intervention, the in-person workshop, or the control condition. "
9649,1,"The intervention was underpinned by social cognitive theory, incorporating behavior change techniques. "
9650,1,Participants progressed through a series of self-reflection exercises and developed a goal for change. 
9651,1,Control participants received the Position Statement on Active Outdoor Play. 
9652,1,The primary outcome was increase in tolerance of risky play and the secondary outcome was goal attainment. 
9653,1,"Data were collected online via REDCap at baseline, 1 week, and 3 months after the intervention. "
9654,1,Randomization was conducted using sealed envelope. 
9655,1,Allocations were concealed to researchers at assignment and data analysis. 
9656,1,"We conducted mediation analyses to examine whether the intervention influenced elements of social cognitive theory, as hypothesized."
9657,2,"A total of 451 mothers were randomized and completed baseline sociodemographic assessments: 150 in the web-based intervention, 153 in the in-person workshop, and 148 in the control condition. "
9658,2,"Among these, a total of 351 mothers completed the intervention. "
9659,2,"At 1 week after the intervention, 113, 85, and 135 mothers completed assessments for each condition, respectively, and at 3 months after the intervention, 105, 84, and 123 completed the assessments, respectively. "
9660,2,"Compared with mothers in the control condition, mothers in the web-based intervention had significantly higher tolerance of risky play at 1 week (P=.004) and 3 months after the intervention (P=.007); and mothers in the in-person workshop had significantly higher tolerance of risky play at 1 week after the intervention (P=.02). "
9661,2,No other significant outcomes were found. 
9662,2,None of the potential mediators were found to significantly mediate the outcomes.
9663,3,The trial demonstrates that the web-based intervention was effective in increasing mothers' tolerance for risk in play.
9664,4,Machine Learning-Driven Models to Predict Prognostic Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized With Heart Failure Using Electronic Health Records: Retrospective Study
9665,0,"With the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases increasing worldwide, early prediction and accurate assessment of heart failure (HF) risk are crucial to meet the clinical demand."
9666,1,"For this single-center study, we recruited patients with newly diagnosed HF hospitalized between December 2010 and August 2018 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University (Liaoning Province, China). "
9667,1,The models were constructed for a population set (90:10 split of data set into training and test sets) using 79 variables during the first hospitalization. 
9668,1,"Logistic regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting models were investigated for outcome predictions."
9669,2,"Of the 13,602 patients with HF enrolled in the study, 537 (3.95%) died within 1 year and 2779 patients (20.43%) had a history of use of positive inotropic agents. "
9670,2,"ML algorithms improved the performance of predictive models for 1-year in-hospital mortality (areas under the curve [AUCs] 0.92-1.00), use of positive inotropic medication (AUCs 0.85-0.96), and 1-year readmission rates (AUCs 0.63-0.96). "
9671,2,"A decision tree of mortality risk was created and stratified by single variables at levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (<0.068 mu g/L), followed by percentage of lymphocytes (<14.688%) and neutrophil count (4.870x10(9)/L)."
9672,3,ML techniques based on a large scale of clinical variables can improve outcome predictions for patients with HF. 
9673,3,The mortality decision tree may contribute to guiding better clinical risk assessment and decision making.
9674,4,Diabetology 4.0: Scoping Review of Novel Insights and Possibilities Offered by Digitalization
9675,0,The increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and associated morbidity worldwide justifies the need to create new approaches and strategies for diabetes therapy. 
9676,0,"Therefore, the ongoing digitalization offers novel opportunities in this field."
9677,1,"A scoping review was carried out, and a literature search was performed using electronic databases (MEDLINE [PubMed], Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science). "
9678,1,The results were categorized according to the type of technology presented.
9679,2,"Different types of technology (eg, glucose monitoring systems, insulin pens, insulin pumps, closed-loop systems, mobile health apps, telemedicine, and electronic medical records) may help to improve diabetes treatment. "
9680,2,These improvements primarily affect glycemic control. 
9681,2,"However, they may also help in increasing the autonomy and quality of life of people who are diagnosed with diabetes mellitus."
9682,3,Diabetes technologies have developed rapidly over the last few years and offer novel insights into diabetes therapy and a chance to improve and individualize diabetes treatment. 
9683,3,"Challenges that need to be addressed in the following years relate to data security, interoperability, and the development of standards."
9684,4,Predicting Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Pancreatectomy Using Wearable Technology and Machine Learning: Prospective Cohort Study
9685,0,"Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and although pancreatectomy is currently the only curative treatment, it is associated with significant morbidity."
9686,1,"In this prospective, single-center, single-cohort study, patients scheduled for pancreatectomy were provided with a wearable telemonitoring device to be worn prior to surgery. "
9687,1,Patient clinical data were collected and all patients were evaluated using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical risk calculator (ACS-NSQIP SRC). 
9688,1,Machine learning models were developed to predict whether patients would have a textbook outcome and compared with the ACS-NSQIP SRC using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves.
9689,2,"Between February 2019 and February 2020, 48 patients completed the study. "
9690,2,Patient activity metrics were collected over an average of 27.8 days before surgery. 
9691,2,Patients took an average of 4162.1 (SD 4052.6) steps per day and had an average heart rate of 75.6 (SD 14.8) beats per minute. 
9692,2,Twenty-eight (58%) patients had a textbook outcome after pancreatectomy. 
9693,2,The group of 20 (42%) patients who did not have a textbook outcome included 14 patients with severe complications and 11 patients requiring readmission. 
9694,2,"The ACS-NSQIP SRC had an AUROC curve of 0.6333 to predict failure to achieve a textbook outcome, while our model combining patient clinical characteristics and patient activity data achieved the highest performance with an AUROC curve of 0.7875."
9695,3,Machine learning models outperformed ACS-NSQIP SRC estimates in predicting textbook outcomes after pancreatectomy. 
9696,3,The highest performance was observed when machine learning models incorporated patient clinical characteristics and activity metrics.
9697,4,"Antecedents of Individuals Concerns Regarding Hospital Hygiene and Surgery Postponement During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional, Web-Based Survey Study"
9698,0,The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major challenge to people's everyday lives. 
9699,0,"In the context of hospitalization, the pandemic is expected to have a strong influence on affective reactions and preventive behaviors. "
9700,0,Research is needed to develop evidence-driven strategies for coping with the challenges of the pandemic. 
9701,0,"Therefore, this survey study investigates the effects that personality traits, risk-taking behaviors, and anxiety have on medical service-related affective reactions and anticipated behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic."
9702,1,"We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of 929 residents in Germany (women: 792/929, 85.3%; age: mean 35.2 years, SD 12.9 years). "
9703,1,Hypotheses were tested by conducting a saturated path analysis.
9704,2,"We found that anxiety had a direct effect on people's concerns about safety (beta=-.12, 95% CI -.20 to -.05) and hygiene in hospitals (beta=.16, 95% CI .08 to .23). "
9705,2,Risk-taking behaviors and personality traits were not associated with concerns about safety and hygiene in hospitals or anticipated behaviors.
9706,3,Our findings suggest that distinct interventions and information campaigns are not necessary for individuals with different personality traits or different levels of risk-taking behavior. 
9707,3,"However, we recommend that health care workers should carefully address anxiety when interacting with patients."
9708,4,e-Mental Health Program Usage Patterns in Randomized Controlled Trials and in the General Public to Inform External Validity Considerations: Sample Groupings Using Cluster Analyses
9709,0,Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with vigorous study designs are vital for determining the efficacy of treatments. 
9710,0,"Despite the high internal validity attributed to RCTs, external validity concerns limit the generalizability of results to the general population. "
9711,0,"Bias can be introduced, for example, when study participants who self-select into a trial are more motivated to comply with study conditions than are other individuals. "
9712,0,"These external validity considerations extend to e-mental health (eMH) research, especially when eMH tools are designed for public access and provide minimal or no supervision."
9713,1,"Australian adults signed up to myCompass, a self-guided online treatment program created to reduce mild to moderate symptoms of negative emotions. "
9714,1,"They did so either by being part of an RCT onboarding (160/231, 69.6% female) or by accessing the program freely on the internet (5563/8391, 66.30% female) between October 2011 and October 2012. "
9715,1,"During registration, RCT participants and community users provided basic demographic information. "
9716,1,"Usage metrics (number of logins, trackings, and learning activities) were recorded by the system."
9717,2,"Samples at sign-up differed significantly in age (P=.003), with community users being on average 3 years older (mean 41.78, SD 13.64) than RCT participants (mean 38.79, SD 10.73). "
9718,2,"Furthermore, frequency of program use was higher for RCT participants on all usage metrics compared to community users through the first 49 days after registration (all P values < .001). "
9719,2,"Two-step cluster analyses revealed 3 user groups in the RCT sample (Nonstarters, 10-Timers, and 30+-Timers) and 2 user groups in the community samples (2-Timers and 20-Timers). "
9720,2,"Groups seemed comparable in patterns of use but differed in magnitude, with RCT participant usage groups showing more frequent engagement than community usage groups. "
9721,2,Only the high-usage group among RCT participants approached myCompass usage recommendations.
9722,3,Findings suggested that external validity concerns of RCT designs may arise with regards to the predicted magnitude of eMH program use rather than overall usage styles. 
9723,3,Following up RCT nonstarters may help provide unique insights into why individuals choose not to engage with an eMH program despite generally being willing to participate in an eMH evaluation study. 
9724,3,Overestimating frequency of engagement with eMH tools may have theoretical implications and potentially impact economic considerations for plans to disseminate these tools to the general public.
9725,4,eHealth Applications to Support Independent Living of Older Persons: Scoping Review of Costs and Benefits Identified in Economic Evaluations
9726,0,"eHealth applications are constantly increasing and are frequently considered to constitute a promising strategy for cost containment in health care, particularly if the applications aim to support older persons. "
9727,0,"Older persons are, however, not the only major eHealth stakeholder. "
9728,0,"eHealth suppliers, caregivers, funding bodies, and health authorities are also likely to attribute value to eHealth applications, but they can differ in their value attribution because they are affected differently by eHealth costs and benefits. "
9729,0,"Therefore, any assessment of the value of eHealth applications requires the consideration of multiple stakeholders in a holistic and integrated manner. "
9730,0,Such a holistic and reliable value assessment requires a profound understanding of the application's costs and benefits. 
9731,0,The first step in measuring costs and benefits is identifying the relevant costs and benefit categories that the eHealth application affects.
9732,1,"We conducted a systematic literature search covering papers published until December 2019 by using the Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL EB SCOhost databases. "
9733,1,"We included papers on eHealth applications with web-based contact possibilities between clients and health care providers (mobile health apps) and applications for self-management, telehomecare, telemedicine, telemonitoring, telerehabilitation, and active healthy aging technologies for older persons. "
9734,1,"We included studies that focused on any type of economic evaluation, including costs and benefit measures."
9735,2,We identified 55 papers with economic evaluations. 
9736,2,These studies considered a range of different types of costs and benefits. 
9737,2,Costs pertained to implementation activities and operational activities related to eHealth applications. 
9738,2,"Benefits (or consequences) could be categorized according to stakeholder groups, that is, older persons, caregivers, and health care providers. "
9739,2,These benefits can further be divided into stakeholder-specific outcomes and resource usage. 
9740,2,Some cost and benefit types have received more attention than others. 
9741,2,"For instance, patient outcomes have been predominantly captured via quality-of-life considerations and various types of physical health status indicators. "
9742,2,"From the perspective of resource usage, a strong emphasis has been placed on home care visits and hospital usage."
9743,3,"Economic evaluations of eHealth applications are gaining momentum, and studies have shown considerable variation regarding the costs and benefits that they include. "
9744,3,We contribute to the body of literature by providing a detailed and up-to-date framework of cost and benefit categories that any interested stakeholder can use as a starting point to conduct an economic evaluation in the context of independent living of older persons.
9745,4,"Telemedicine Awareness, Knowledge, Attitude, and Skills of Health Care Workers in a Low-Resource Country During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study"
9746,0,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, several health care programs intended to provide telemedicine services have been introduced in Libya. "
9747,0,Many physicians have used these services to provide care and advice to their patients remotely.
9748,1,"In this cross-sectional study, we administered a web-based survey to health care workers in Libya in May 2020. "
9749,1,"The questionnaire collected information on physicians' general demographic characteristics, ability to use a computer, and telemedicine awareness, knowledge, attitude, and skills."
9750,2,"Among 673 health care workers who responded to the survey, 377 (56%) and 248 (36.8%) reported high awareness and high computer skill scores, respectively, for telemedicine. "
9751,2,"Furthermore, 582 (86.5%) and 566 (82.6%) health care workers reported high knowledge and high attitude scores, respectively. "
9752,2,"We observed no significant differences in awareness, knowledge, attitude, and skill scores among physicians employed at public, private, or both types of hospitals. "
9753,2,"We observed significant differences in the mean awareness (P<.001), attitude (P=.001), and computer skill scores (P<.001) , where the score distribution of the groups based on the ability to use computers was not similar. "
9754,2,Knowledge scores did not significantly differ among the three groups (P=.37). 
9755,2,Respondents with professional computer skills had significantly higher awareness (chi(2)(3) =14.5; P<.001) and attitude (chi(2)(3) =13.5; P=.001) scores than those without professional computer skills. 
9756,2,We observed significant differences in the mean computer skill scores of the groups (chi(2)(3) =199.6; P<.001).
9757,3,The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to persist for a long time. 
9758,3,"Hence, policy programs such as telemedicine services, which aim to address the obstacles to medical treatment owing to physical distancing measures, will likely continue for a long time. "
9759,3,"Therefore, there is a need to train and support health care workers and initiate government programs that provide adequate and supportive health care services to patients in transitional countries."
9760,4,A Web-Based Computer-Tailored Program to Improve Treatment Adherence in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: Randomized Controlled Trial
9761,0,"Adherence to core type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment behaviors is suboptimal, and nonadherence is generally not limited to one treatment behavior. "
9762,0,The internet holds promise for programs that aim to improve adherence. 
9763,0,"We developed a computer-tailored eHealth program for patients with T2DM to improve their treatment adherence, that is, adherence to both a healthy lifestyle and medical behaviors."
9764,1,"Patients with T2DM were recruited by their health professionals and randomized into either the intervention group, that is, access to the eHealth program for 6 months, or a waiting-list control group. "
9765,1,"In total, 478 participants completed the baseline questionnaire, of which 234 gained access to the eHealth program. "
9766,1,"Of the 478 participants, 323 were male and 155 were female, the mean age was 60 years, and the participants had unfavorable BMI and HbA(1c) levels on average. "
9767,1,"Outcome data were collected through web-based assessments on physical activity (PA) levels, caloric intake from unhealthy snacks, and adherence to oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) and insulin therapy. "
9768,1,Changes to separate behaviors were standardized and summed into a composite change score representing changes in the overall treatment adherence. 
9769,1,"Further standardization of this composite change score yielded the primary outcome, which can be interpreted as Cohen d (effect size) Standardized change scores observed in separate behaviors acted as secondary outcomes. "
9770,1,"Mixed linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the effectiveness of the intervention on overall and separate treatment behavior adherence, accommodating relevant covariates and patient nesting."
9771,2,"After the 6-month follow-up assessment, 47.4% (111/234) of participants in the intervention group and 72.5% (177/244) of participants in the control group were retained. "
9772,2,"The overall treatment adherence improved significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group, reflected by a small effect size (d=0.27; 95% CI 0.032 to 0.509; P=.03). "
9773,2,"When considering changes in separate treatment behaviors, a significant decrease was observed only in caloric intake from unhealthy snacks in comparison with the control group (d=0.36; 95% CI 0.136 to 0.584; P=.002). "
9774,2,"For adherence to PA (d=-0.14; 95% CI -0.388 to 0.109; P=.27), OHAs (d=0.27; 95% CI -0.027 to 0.457; P=.08), and insulin therapy (d=0.35; 95% CI -0.066 to 0.773; P=.10), no significant changes were observed. "
9775,2,"These results from the unadjusted analyses were comparable with the results of the adjusted analyses, the per-protocol analyses, and the sensitivity analyses."
9776,3,Our multibehavior program significantly improved the overall treatment adherence compared with the control group. 
9777,3,"To further enhance the impact of the intervention in the personal, societal, and economic areas, a wide-scale implementation of our eHealth intervention is suggested."
9778,4,Identifying Self-Management Support Needs for Pregnant Women With Opioid Misuse in Online Health Communities: Mixed Methods Analysis of Web Posts
9779,0,"The current opioid crisis in the United States impacts broad population groups, including pregnant women. "
9780,0,Opioid use during pregnancy can affect the health and wellness of both mothers and their infants. 
9781,0,Understanding women's efforts to self-manage opioid use or misuse in pregnancy is needed to identify intervention points for improving maternal outcomes.
9782,1,A total of 200 web posts by pregnant women with opioid use participating in an OHC were double coded. 
9783,1,Concepts and their thematic connections were identified through an inductive process until theoretical saturation was reached. 
9784,1,Statistical tests were performed to identify patterns.
9785,2,"The majority of pregnant women (150/200, 75.0%) in the OHC exhibited signs of misuse, and 62.5% (125/200) of the participants were either contemplating or pursuing dosage reduction. "
9786,2,Self-managed withdrawal was more common (P<.001) than professional treatment among the population. 
9787,2,"A total of 5 themes of self-management support needs were identified as women sought information about the potential adverse effects of gestational opioid use, protocols for self-managed withdrawal, pain management safety during pregnancy, hospital policies and legal procedures related to child protection, and strategies for navigating offline support systems. "
9788,2,"In addition, 58.5% (117/200) of the pregnant women expressed negative emotions, of whom only 10.2% (12/117) sought to address their emotional needs with the help of the OHC."
9789,3,OHCs provide vital self-management support for pregnant women with opioid use or misuse. 
9790,3,"Women pursuing self-managed dosage reduction are prone to misinformation and repeated relapses, which can result in extreme measures to avoid testing positive for drug use at labor. "
9791,3,"The study findings provide evidence for public policy considerations, including universal screening of substance use for pregnant women, emphasis on treatment rather than legal punishment, and further expansion of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act waiver training program. "
9792,3,"The improvement of web-based platforms that can organize geo-relevant information, dispense clinically validated withdrawal schedules, and offer structured peer support is envisioned for harm reduction among pregnant women who opt for self-management of opioid misuse."
9793,4,Novel Analgesic Index for Postoperative Pain Assessment Based on a Photoplethysmographic Spectrogram and Convolutional Neural Network: Observational Study
9794,0,"Although commercially available analgesic indices based on biosignal processing have been used to quantify nociception during general anesthesia, their performance is low in conscious patients. "
9795,0,"Therefore, there is a need to develop a new analgesic index with improved performance to quantify postoperative pain in conscious patients."
9796,1,PPGs were obtained from a group of surgical patients for 6 minutes both in the absence (preoperatively) and in the presence (postoperatively) of pain. 
9797,1,"Then, the PPG data of the latter 5 minutes were used for analysis. "
9798,1,"Based on the PPGs and a CNN, we developed a spectrogram-CNN index for pain assessment. "
9799,1,The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was measured to evaluate the performance of the 2 indices.
9800,2,PPGs from 100 patients were used to develop the spectrogram-CNN index. 
9801,2,"When there was pain, the mean (95% CI) spectrogram-CNN index value increased significantly-baseline: 28.5 (24.2-30.7) versus recovery area: 65.7 (60.5-68.3); P<.01. "
9802,2,"The AUC and balanced accuracy were 0.76 and 71.4%, respectively. "
9803,2,"The spectrogram-CNN index cutoff value for detecting pain was 48, with a sensitivity of 68.3% and specificity of 73.8%."
9804,3,"Although there were limitations to the study design, we confirmed that the spectrogram-CNN index can efficiently detect postoperative pain in conscious patients. "
9805,3,"Further studies are required to assess the spectrogram-CNN index's feasibility and prevent overfitting to various populations, including patients under general anesthesia."
9806,4,Economic Burden and Health Care Access for Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in China: Web-Based Survey Study
9807,0,"The increasing incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has imposed heavy financial burdens for Chinese patients; however, data about their financial status and access to health care are still lacking. "
9808,0,This information is important for informing patients with IBD about disease treatment budgets and health care strategies.
9809,1,Our study was performed in 14 IBD centers in mainland China between 2018 and 2019 through WeChat. 
9810,1,Participants were asked to complete a 64-item web-based questionnaire. 
9811,1,Data were collected by the Wenjuanxing survey program. 
9812,1,"We mainly focused on income and insurance status, medical costs, and access to health care providers. "
9813,1,Respondents were stratified by income and the associations of income with medical costs and emergency visit times were analyzed.
9814,2,"In this study, 3000 patients with IBD, that is, 1922 patients with Crohn disease, 973 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 105 patients with undetermined colitis were included. "
9815,2,"During the last 12 months, the mean (SD) direct and indirect costs for per patient with IBD were approximately US $11,668.68 ($7944.44) and US $74.90 ($253.60) in China. "
9816,2,The average reimbursement ratios for most outpatient and inpatient costs were less than 50%. 
9817,2,"However, the income of 85.5% (2565/3000) of the patients was less than (sic)10,000 (US $1445) per month. "
9818,2,"Approximately 96.5% (2894/3000) of the patients were covered by health insurance, but only 24.7% (741/3000) of the patients had private commercial insurance, which has higher imbursement ratios. "
9819,2,Nearly 98.0% (2954/3000) of the patients worried about their financial situation. 
9820,2,"Thus, 79.7% (2392/3000) of the patients with IBD tried to save money for health care and even delayed their medical treatments. "
9821,2,"About half of the respondents (1282/3000, 42.7%) had no primary care provider, and 52.2% (1567/3000) of the patients had to visit the emergency room 1-4 times per year for the treatment of their IBD. "
9822,2,Multivariate analysis revealed that lower income (P=.001) and higher transportation (P=.004) and accommodation costs (P=.001) were significantly associated with the increased number of emergency visits of the patients.
9823,3,"Chinese patients with IBD have enormous financial burdens and difficulties in accessing health care, which have increased their financial anxiety and inevitably influenced their disease outcomes. "
9824,3,"Early purchase of private insurance, thereby increasing the reimbursement ratio for medical expenses, and developing the use of telemedicine would be effective strategies for saving on health care costs."
9825,4,Use of Facebook by Academic Medical Centers in Taiwan During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study
9826,0,"The battle against COVID-19 remains ongoing, and social media has played an important role during the crisis for both communication and health promotion, particularly for health care organizations. "
9827,0,Taiwan's success during the COVID-19 outbreak is well known and the use of social media is one of the key contributing factors to that success.
9828,1,We conducted a nationwide observational study of all Facebook fan page posts culled from the official accounts of all medical centers in Taiwan from December 2019 to April 2020. 
9829,1,All Facebook posts were categorized into either COVID-19-related posts or non-COVID-19-related posts. 
9830,1,"COVID-19-related posts were split into 4 categories: policy of Taiwan's Center for Disease Control (TCDC), gratitude notes, news and regulations from hospitals, and education. "
9831,1,"Data from each post was also recorded as follows: date of post, headline, number of ""likes,"" number of messages left, number of shares, video or non-video post, and date of search."
9832,2,"The Facebook fan pages of 13 academic medical centers, with a total of 1816 posts, were analyzed. "
9833,2,"From January 2020, the percentage of COVID-19 posts increased rapidly, from 21% (January 2020) to 56.3% (April 2020). "
9834,2,"The trends of cumulative COVID-19 posts and reported confirmed cases were significantly related (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.93, P<.001). "
9835,2,"Pages from private hospitals had more COVID-19 posts (362 versus 289), as well as more video posts (72 posts, 19.9% versus 36 posts, 12.5%, P=.011), when compared to public hospitals. "
9836,2,"However, Facebook pages from public hospitals had significantly more ""likes,"" comments, and shares per post (314, 5, 14, respectively, P<.001). "
9837,2,"Additionally, medical centers from different regions displayed different strategies for using video posts on Facebook."
9838,3,Social media has been a useful tool for communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
9839,3,"This nationwide observational study has helped demonstrate the value of Facebook for academic medical centers in Taiwan, along with its engagement efficacy. "
9840,3,We believe that the experience of Taiwan and the knowledge it can share will be helpful to health care organizations worldwide during our global battle against COVID-19.
9841,4,Impact of Patient-Clinical Team Secure Messaging on Communication Patterns and Patient Experience: Randomized Encouragement Design Trial
9842,0,"Although secure messaging (SM) between patients and clinical team members is a recommended component of continuous care, uptake by patients remains relatively low. "
9843,0,We designed a multicomponent Supported Adoption Program (SAP) to increase SM adoption among patients using the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for primary care.
9844,1,We randomized 1195 patients at 3 VHA facilities who had MHV portal accounts but had never used SM. 
9845,1,"Half were randomized to receive the SAP, and half served as controls receiving usual care. "
9846,1,"The SAP consisted of encouragement to adopt SM via mailed educational materials, proactive SM sent to patients, and telephone-based motivational interviews. "
9847,1,We examined differences in SM adoption rates between SAP recipients and controls at 9 months and 21 months. 
9848,1,Follow-up telephone surveys were conducted to assess perceived provider autonomy support and self-report of telephone communication with clinical teams.
9849,2,"Patients randomized to the SAP had significantly higher rates of SM adoption than the control group (101/595, 17.0% vs 40/600, 6.7%; P<.001). "
9850,2,"Most adopters in the SAP sent their first message without a motivational interview (71/101, 70.3%). "
9851,2,"The 10-percentage point difference in adoption persisted a full year after the encouragement ended (23.7%, 142/600 in the SAP group vs 13.5%, 80/595 in the control group, P<.001). "
9852,2,We obtained follow-up survey data from 49.54% (592/1195) of the participants. 
9853,2,"SAP participants reported higher perceived provider autonomy support (5.7 vs 5.4, P=.007) and less telephone use to communicate with their provider (68.8% vs 76.0%, P=.05), compared to patients in the control group. "
9854,2,"Patient-reported barriers to SM adoption included self-efficacy (eg, not comfortable using a computer, 24%), no perceived need for SM (22%), and difficulties with portal password or login (17%)."
9855,3,The multicomponent SAP was successful in increasing use of SM 10 percentage points above standard care; new SM adopters reported improved perceptions of provider autonomy support and less use of the telephone to communicate with their providers. 
9856,3,"Still, despite the encouragement and technical assistance provided through the SAP, adoption rates were lower than anticipated, reaching only 24% at 21 months (10% above controls). "
9857,3,Common barriers to adoption such as limited perceived need for SM may be more challenging to address and require different interventions than barriers related to patient self-efficacy or technical difficulties.
9858,4,Associations Between COVID-19 Misinformation Exposure and Belief With COVID-19 Knowledge and Preventive Behaviors: Cross-Sectional Online Study
9859,0,Online misinformation proliferation during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health concern.
9860,1,A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 1049 South Korean adults in April 2020. 
9861,1,Respondents were asked about receiving COVID-19 misinformation using 12 items identified by the World Health Organization. 
9862,1,"Logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the association of receiving misinformation with sociodemographic characteristics, source of information, COVID-19 misinformation belief, and psychological distress, as well as the associations of COVID-19 misinformation belief with COVID-19 knowledge and the number of COVID-19 preventive behaviors among those who received the misinformation. "
9863,1,All data were weighted according to the Korea census data in 2018.
9864,2,"Overall, 67.78% (n=711) of respondents reported exposure to at least one COVID-19 misinformation item. "
9865,2,"Misinformation exposure was associated with younger age, higher education levels, and lower income. "
9866,2,"Sources of information associated with misinformation exposure were social networking services (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.32) and instant messaging (aOR 1.79, 1.27-2.51). "
9867,2,"Misinformation exposure was also associated with psychological distress including anxiety (aOR 1.80, 1.24-2.61), depressive (aOR 1.47, 1.09-2.00), and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (aOR 1.97, 1.42-2.73), as well as misinformation belief (aOR 7.33, 5.17-10.38). "
9868,2,"Misinformation belief was associated with poorer COVID-19 knowledge (high: aOR 0.62, 0.45-0.84) and fewer preventive behaviors (>= 7 behaviors: aOR 0.54, 0.39-0.74)."
9869,3,"COVID-19 misinformation exposure was associated with misinformation belief, while misinformation belief was associated with fewer preventive behaviors. "
9870,3,"Given the potential of misinformation to undermine global efforts in COVID-19 disease control, up-to-date public health strategies are required to counter the proliferation of misinformation."
9871,4,Automated Smart Home Assessment to Support Pain Management: Multiple Methods Analysis
9872,0,"Poorly managed pain can lead to substance use disorders, depression, suicide, worsening health, and increased use of health services. "
9873,0,Most pain assessments occur in clinical settings away from patients' natural environments. 
9874,0,Advances in smart home technology may allow observation of pain in the home setting. 
9875,0,"Smart homes recognizing human behaviors may be useful for quantifying functional pain interference, thereby creating new ways of assessing pain and supporting people living with pain."
9876,1,"A multiple methods, secondary data analysis was conducted using historic ambient sensor data and weekly nursing assessment data from 11 independent older adults reporting pain across 1-2 years of smart home monitoring. "
9877,1,A qualitative approach was used to interpret sensor-based data of 27 unique pain events to support clinician-guided training of a machine learning model. 
9878,1,"A periodogram was used to calculate circadian rhythm strength, and a random forest containing 100 trees was employed to train a machine learning model to recognize pain-related behaviors. "
9879,1,The model extracted 550 behavioral markers for each sensor-based data segment. 
9880,1,"These were treated as both a binary classification problem (event, control) and a regression problem."
9881,2,"We found 13 clinically relevant behaviors, revealing 6 pain-related behavioral qualitative themes. "
9882,2,"Quantitative results were classified using a clinician-guided random forest technique that yielded a classification accuracy of 0.70, sensitivity of 0.72, specificity of 0.69, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.756, and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.777 in comparison to using standard anomaly detection techniques without clinician guidance (0.16 accuracy achieved; P<.001). "
9883,2,"The regression formulation achieved moderate correlation, with r=0.42."
9884,3,Findings of this secondary data analysis reveal that a pain-assessing smart home may recognize pain-related behaviors. 
9885,3,Utilizing clinicians' real-world knowledge when developing pain-assessing machine learning models improves the model's performance. 
9886,3,A larger study focusing on pain-related behaviors is warranted to improve and test model performance.
9887,4,Usability and Acceptability of a Mobile App to Help Emerging Adults Address their Friends Substance Use (Harbor): Quantitative Study
9888,0,Technology-assisted intervention and prevention strategies present opportunities for substance use-related research with emerging adults (EAs) and their peers. 
9889,0,"Emerging adulthood is a developmentally distinct period in which individuals between the ages of 18 and 29 years undergo unique emotional, cultural, developmental, and biological changes as they transition into adulthood. "
9890,0,"Crowdsourcing, or gathering feedback from a large group within web-based communities, offers researchers a unique and cost-effective way to obtain large amounts of information in a short period."
9891,1,We examined feedback on the wording of the intervention scripts and estimated the market size of EAs who may use this app. 
9892,1,"Furthermore, we calculated correlations between script ratings and measures of personal risky drinking (ie, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test) and the participants' use of confrontational, enabling, or supportive behaviors with an existing friend."
9893,2,"Approximately half of our sample (208/458, 45.4%) indicated that they had a close friend for whom they had concerns about their substance use, suggesting a potentially high demand for an app such as Harbor. "
9894,2,Initial findings suggest that peers who engage in less enabling behaviors with friends who have a substance use problem exhibited lower risky drinking behaviors overall (r(206)=-0.501; P<.001). 
9895,2,"Concerning acceptability, 98.0% (449/458) of the sample rated the scripts' dialogue as either somewhat, moderately, or extremely realistic (mean 3.92, SD 0.48) on 5-point Likert scale items. "
9896,2,"Finally, 95.4% (437/454) of respondents indicated that the scripts would be at least slightly helpful for training peers to help their friends with substance use issues. "
9897,2,"Finally, individuals who were better able to identify enabling language in enabling scripts self-reported fewer enabling behaviors toward their friend's substance use (r(206)=-0.236; P=.001)."
9898,3,There exists a demonstrated level of desirability and acceptability among EAs for a mobile app such as Harbor. 
9899,3,EAs who wish to engage in more supportive behaviors with their friends who engage in substance use and who are amenable to assisting their friends with sobriety likely would use and benefit from this app.
9900,4,Telemedicine Usage Among Urologists During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Study
9901,0,"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, urology was one of the specialties with the lowest rates of telemedicine and videoconferencing use. "
9902,0,"Common barriers to the implementation of telemedicine included a lack of technological literacy, concerns with reimbursement, and resistance to changes in the workplace. "
9903,0,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020, the delivery of urological services globally has quickly shifted to telemedicine to account for the mass clinical, procedural, and operative cancellations, inadequate personal protective equipment, and shortage of personnel."
9904,1,"We conducted a global, cross-sectional, web-based survey to investigate the use of telemedicine before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. "
9905,1,Urologists' perceived usability of telemedicine was assessed using a modified Delphi approach to create questions based on a modified version of the validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). 
9906,1,"For the purposes of this study, telemedicine was defined as video calls only."
9907,2,A total of 620 urologists from 58 different countries and 6 continents participated in the survey. 
9908,2,"Prior to COVID-19, 15.8% (n=98) of urologists surveyed were using telemedicine in their clinical practices; during the pandemic, that proportion increased to 46.1% (n=283). "
9909,2,"Of the urologists without telemedicine experience, interest in telemedicine usage increased from 43.7% (n=139) to 80.8% (n=257) during the COVID-19 pandemic. "
9910,2,"Among urologists that used telemedicine during the pandemic, 80.9% (n=244) were interested in continuing to use it in their practice. "
9911,2,"The three most commonly used platforms were Zoom, Doxy.me, and Epic, and the top three barriers to implementing telemedicine were patients' lack of technological comprehension, patients' lack of access to the required technology, and reimbursement concerns."
9912,3,"This is the first study to quantify the use, usability, and pervading interest in telemedicine among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. "
9913,3,"In the face of this pandemic, urologists'usage of telemedicine nearly tripled, demonstrating their ability to adopt and adapt telemedicine into their practices, but barriers involving the technology itself are still preventing many from utilizing it despite increasing interest."
9914,4,Using Online Support Communities for Tourette Syndrome and Tic Disorders: Online Survey of Users Experiences
9915,0,"People living with a tic disorder (TD)-such as Tourette syndrome (TS)-experience many negative psychological and social challenges arising from chronic tics, such as stigmatization from peers and poorer quality of life, and these can impact upon their families too. "
9916,0,"It can be difficult for this population to access face-to-face support for tics, and so online support communities offer one avenue for support from peers facing similar experiences. "
9917,0,"However, little is known about how online support communities may be used by people with TS and other TDs, and by others (eg, parents, caregivers) supporting a person with TS/TD."
9918,1,"In total, 90 respondents (aged 13-62 years; 62% [56/90] female) from 13 countries completed an online survey exploring their experiences of using online support communities for TS and TDs. "
9919,1,"Respondents were people living with TS/TD themselves (n=68) or supportive others of someone with TS/TD (eg, parent, sibling, spouse; n=14), or both (n=8). "
9920,1,"The online survey contained open-ended questions eliciting their self-reported motivations for using online communities, their benefits and drawbacks of participation, and whether online support communities affected offline management of tics. "
9921,1,Responses were analyzed using thematic analysis.
9922,2,Seven overarching themes captured experiences of using online support communities for TS/TDs. 
9923,2,The overwhelming reason for their use was to find accessible support due to a lack of offline face-to-face support. 
9924,2,"Online support communities were valued sources of informational and emotional support, and also had a positive impact upon helping users' psychological well-being. "
9925,2,Online communities helped provide a space where people with TS/TDs could feel accepted and reduce the social isolation they felt offline. 
9926,2,"The suggestible nature of tics and being reminded of the challenging nature of TDs were main disadvantages arising from using online support communities, alongside conflict arising within online communities."
9927,3,"The findings suggest that online support communities appear to offer valuable informational and emotional support to those living with TS/TD and their families too, especially given the lack of locally available support. "
9928,3,"This facilitates a sense of community online, which can help users in overcoming long-standing social isolation and aid self-reported improvements in psychosocial well-being. "
9929,3,"Users reported some drawbacks in engaging with online support communities, such as conflict between different types of users and triggering content, which negatively affected experiences of community participation."
9930,4,Brain Tumor Discussions on Twitter (#BTSM): Social Network Analysis
9931,0,The Brain Tumor Social Media (#BTSM) Twitter hashtag was founded in February 2012 as a disease-specific hashtag for patients with brain tumor.
9932,1,"We analyzed all tweets containing #BTSM from 2012 to 2018 using the Symplur Signals platform to obtain data and to describe Symplur-defined user categories, tweet content, and trends in use over time. "
9933,1,We created a network plot with all publicly available retweets involving #BTSM in 2018 to visualize key stakeholders and their connections to other users.
9934,2,"From 2012 to 2018, 59,764 unique users participated in #BTSM, amassing 298,904 tweets. "
9935,2,"The yearly volume of #BTSM tweets increased by 264.57% from 16,394 in 2012 to 43,373 in 2018 with #BTSM constantly trending in the top 15 list of disease hashtags, as well the top 15 list of tweet chats. "
9936,2,"Patient advocates generated the most #BTSM tweets (33.13%), while advocacy groups, caregivers, doctors, and researchers generated 7.01%, 4.63%, 3.86%, and 3.37%, respectively. "
9937,2,"Physician use, although still low, has increased over time. "
9938,2,"The 2018 network plot of retweets including #BTSM identifies a number of key stakeholders from the patient advocate, patient organization, and medical researcher domains and reveals the extent of their reach to other users."
9939,3,"From its start in 2012, #BTSM has grown exponentially over time. "
9940,3,"We believe its growth suggests its potential as a global source of brain tumor information on Twitter for patients, advocates, patient organizations as well as health care professionals and researchers."
9941,4,Psychometric Evaluation of the TWente Engagement with Ehealth Technologies Scale (TWEETS): Evaluation Study
9942,0,Engagement emerges as a predictor for the effectiveness of digital health interventions. 
9943,0,"However, a shared understanding of engagement is missing. "
9944,0,"Therefore, a new scale has been developed that proposes a clear definition and creates a tool to measure it. "
9945,0,The TWente Engagement with Ehealth Technologies Scale (TWEETS) is based on a systematic review and interviews with engaged health app users. 
9946,0,"It defines engagement as a combination of behavior, cognition, and affect."
9947,1,"In this study, 288 participants were asked to use any step counter app on their smartphones for 2 weeks. "
9948,1,"They completed online questionnaires at 4 time points: T0=baseline, T1=after 1 day, T2=1 week, and T3=2 weeks. "
9949,1,"At T0, demographics and personality (conscientiousness and intellect/imagination) were assessed; at T1-T3, engagement, involvement, enjoyment, subjective usage, and perceived behavior change were included as measures that are theoretically related to our definition of engagement. "
9950,1,"Analyses focused on internal consistency, reliability, and the convergent, divergent, and predictive validity of both engagement scales. "
9951,1,"Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the engagement scales with involvement, enjoyment, and subjective usage; divergent validity was assessed by correlating the engagement scales with personality; and predictive validity was assessed by regression analyses using engagement to predict perceived behavior change at later time points."
9952,2,"The Cronbach alpha values of the TWEETS were .86, .86, and .87 on T1, T2, and T3, respectively. "
9953,2,Exploratory factor analyses indicated that a 1-factor structure best fits the data. 
9954,2,"The TWEETS is moderately to strongly correlated with involvement and enjoyment (theoretically related to cognitive and affective engagement, respectively; P<.001). "
9955,2,"Correlations between the TWEETS and frequency of use were nonsignificant or small, and differences between adherers and nonadherers on the TWEETS were significant (P<.001). "
9956,2,Correlations between personality and the TWEETS were nonsignificant. 
9957,2,"The TWEETS at T1 was predictive of perceived behavior change at T3, with an explained variance of 16%. "
9958,2,"The psychometric properties of the TWEETS and the DBCI-ES-Ex seemed comparable in some aspects (eg, internal consistency), and in other aspects, the TWEETS seemed somewhat superior (divergent and predictive validity)."
9959,3,"The TWEETS performs quite well as an engagement measure with high internal consistency, reasonable test-retest reliability and convergent validity, good divergent validity, and reasonable predictive validity. "
9960,3,"As the psychometric quality of a scale is a reflection of how closely a scale matches the conceptualization of a concept, this paper is also an attempt to conceptualize and define engagement as a unique concept, providing a first step toward an acceptable standard of defining and measuring engagement."
9961,4,"Building a Digital Tool for the Adoption of the World Health Organizations Antenatal Care Recommendations: Methodological Intersection of Evidence, Clinical Logic, and Digital Technology"
9962,0,"One of the key mandates of the World Health Organization (WHO) is to develop guidelines, defined as ""a document containing recommendations for clinical practice or public health policy."" Guidelines represent the global standard for information sources shaping clinical practice and public health policies. "
9963,0,"Despite the rigorous development process and the value of guidelines for setting standards, implementing such standards within local contexts and at the point of care is a well-documented challenge. "
9964,0,Digital technologies enable agile information management and may facilitate the adaptation of guidelines to diverse settings of health services delivery.
9965,1,The WHO convened a team of clinical and digital health experts to develop the WHO digital ANC module as a tool to assist health care professionals in the implementation of WHO evidence-based recommendations for pregnant women. 
9966,1,"The WHO digital ANC module's creation included the following steps: defining a minimum viable product (MW), developing clinical workflows and algorithms, algorithm testing, developing a data dictionary, and the creation of a user interface or application development. "
9967,1,The overall process of development took approximately 1 year to reach a stable prototype and to finalize the underlying content requirements of the data dictionary and decision support algorithms.
9968,2,"The first output is a reference software reflecting the generic WHO ANC guideline content, known as the WHO digital ANC module. "
9969,2,"Within it, all actionable ANC recommendations have related data fields and algorithms to confirm whether the associated task was performed. "
9970,2,"WHO recommendations that are not carried out by the health care worker are saved as pending tasks on a woman's health record, and those that are adequately fulfilled trigger messages with positive reinforcement. "
9971,2,"The second output consists of the structured documentation of the different components which contributed to the development of the WHO digital ANC module, such as the data dictionary and clinical decision support workflows."
9972,3,This is a novel approach to facilitate the adoption and adaptation of recommendations through digital systems at the health service delivery level. 
9973,3,"It is expected that the WHO digital ANC module will support the implementation of evidence-based practices and provide information for monitoring and surveillance; however, further evidence is needed to understand how the WHO digital ANC module impacts the implementation of WHO recommendations. "
9974,3,"Further, the module's implementation will inform the WHO's ongoing efforts to create a pathway to adaptive and integrated (Smart) Guidelines in Digital Systems to improve health system quality, coverage, and accountability."
9975,4,Self-Reported Compliance With Personal Preventive Measures Among Chinese Factory Workers at the Beginning of Work Resumption Following the COVID-19 Outbreak: Cross-Sectional Survey Study
9976,0,Maintaining compliance with personal preventive measures is important to achieve a balance of COVID-19 pandemic control and work resumption.
9977,1,"The participants were adult factory workers who had resumed work in Shenzhen, China A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used. "
9978,1,We randomly selected 14 factories that had resumed work. 
9979,1,All full-time employees aged >= 18 years who had resumed work in these factories were invited to complete a web-based survey. 
9980,1,"Out of 4158 workers who had resumed work in these factories, 3035 (73.0%) completed the web based survey from March 1 to 14, 2020. "
9981,1,Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted.
9982,2,"Among the 3035 participants, 2938 (96.8%) and 2996 (98.7%) reported always wearing a face mask in the workplace and in other public settings, respectively, in the past month. "
9983,2,"However, frequencies of self-reported sanitizing hands (2152/3035, 70.9%), avoiding social and meal gatherings (2225/3035, 73.3%), and avoiding crowded places (1997/3035, 65.8%) were relatively low. "
9984,2,"At the individual level, knowledge about COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] from 1.16, CI 1.10-1.24, to 1.29, CI 1.21-1.37), perceived risk (AORs from 0.58, CI 0.50-0.68, to 0.85, CI 0.72-0.99) and severity (AOR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, and AOR 1.07, CI 1.03-1.11) of COVID-19, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures by the individual (AORs from 1.05, CI 1.00-1.10, to 1.09, CI 1.04-1.13), organization (AOR 1.30, CI 1.20-1.41), and government (AORs from 1.14, CI 1.04-1.25, to 1.21, CI 1.02-1.42), perceived preparedness for a potential outbreak after work resumption (AORs from 1.10, CI 1.00-1.21, to 1.50, CI 1.36-1.64), and depressive symptoms (AORs from 0.93, CI 0.91-0.94, to 0.96, CI 0.92-0.99) were associated with self-reported compliance with at least one personal preventive measure. "
9985,2,"At the interpersonal level, exposure to COVID-19-specific information through official media channels (AOR 1.08, CI 1.04-1.11) and face-to-face communication (AOR 0.90, CI 0.83-0.98) were associated with self-reported sanitizing of hands The number of preventive measures implemented in the workplace was positively associated with self-reported compliance with all four preventive measures (AORs from 1.30, CI 1.08-1.57, to 1.63, CI 1.45-1.84)."
9986,3,Measures are needed to strengthen hand hygiene and physical distancing among factory workers to reduce transmission following work resumption. 
9987,3,Future programs in workplaces should address these factors at multiple levels.
9988,4,Quality and Safety in eHealth: The Need to Build the Evidence Base
9989,0,"Ongoing research is necessary to better understand the causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the developmental outcomes for individuals diagnosed with ASD, and the efficacy of the interventions. "
9990,0,"However, it is often difficult to recruit sufficient numbers of participants for studies, and despite the prevalence of ASD (currently estimated to affect 1 in 54 children), little research has focused on how to efficiently recruit participants with ASD."
9991,1,We examined participant enrollment in a study following nonoverlapping paid advertisements on a popular FM radio station (aired in three cities across two states) and Facebook (six advertisements that ran in five cities across two states). 
9992,1,"The total paid investment in the radio campaign was $12,030 and that in the Facebook campaign was $2950. "
9993,1,"Following the advertising campaigns, 1391 participants in the study who were affiliated with the Houston, Texas, site received email invitations to participate in a brief survey about the ways in which they learned about the study (eg, social media, medical provider, website) and which of these were most influential in their decisions to participate; 374 (26.8%) of the participants completed this survey."
9994,2,"Social media advertising outperformed radio in all three parameters examined by enrolling more participants (338 vs 149), with a lower average cost per participant ($8.73 vs $80.74) and a wider geographic reach, based on a comparison of the number of zip codes within and outside of Texas for questionnaire respondents who rated social media as the most influential method of contact (n=367, chi(2)(1) =5.85, P=.02). "
9995,2,"Of the 374 survey participants, 139 (37.2%) reported that they had seen the study on social media prior to enrollment, while only 9 (2.4%) said they heard about it via radio."
9996,3,"Our findings suggest that advertising on social media can efficiently reach a large pool of potential participants with ASD, increasing the likelihood of meeting study enrollment goals. "
9997,3,"Researchers should consider allocating at least some portion of recruitment dollars to social media platforms as a means of quickly and inexpensively reaching out to their target populations, including for studies with in-person procedures."
9998,4,Artificial Intelligence for the Prediction of Helicobacter Pylori Infection in Endoscopic Images: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Of Diagnostic Test Accuracy
9999,0,"Helicobacter pylori plays a central role in the development of gastric cancer, and prediction of H pylori infection by visual inspection of the gastric mucosa is an important function of endoscopy. "
10000,0,"However, there are currently no established methods of optical diagnosis of H pylori infection using endoscopic images. "
10001,0,Definitive diagnosis requires endoscopic biopsy. 
10002,0,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly adopted in clinical practice, especially for image recognition and classification."
10003,1,Two independent evaluators searched core databases. 
10004,1,The inclusion criteria included studies with endoscopic images of H pylori infection and with application of AI for the prediction of H pylori infection presenting diagnostic performance. 
10005,1,Systematic review and diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis were performed.
10006,2,"Ultimately, 8 studies were identified. "
10007,2,"Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the curve of AI for the prediction of Hpylori infection were 0.87 (95% CI 0.72-0.94), 0.86 (95% CI 0.77-0.92), 40 (95% CI 15-112), and 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94), respectively, in the 1719 patients (385 patients with H pylori infection vs 1334 controls). "
10008,2,Meta-regression showed methodological quality and included the number of patients in each study for the purpose of heterogeneity. 
10009,2,There was no evidence of publication bias. 
10010,2,The accuracy of the AI algorithm reached 82% for discrimination between noninfected images and posteradication images.
10011,3,An AI algorithm is a reliable tool for endoscopic diagnosis of H pylori infection. 
10012,3,The limitations of lacking external validation performance and being conducted only in Asia should be overcome.
10013,4,Clinical Genomic Sequencing Reports in Electronic Health Record Systems Based on International Standards: Implementation Study
10014,0,"To implement standardized machine-processable clinical sequencing reports in an electronic health record (EHR) system, the International Organization for Standardization Technical Specification (ISO/TS) 20428 international standard was proposed for a structured template. "
10015,0,"However, there are no standard implementation guidelines for data items from the proposed standard at the clinical site and no guidelines or references for implementing gene sequencing data results for clinical use. "
10016,0,This is a significant challenge for implementation and application of these standards at individual sites.
10017,1,"In this study, we describe the practical implementation of ISO/TS 20428 using HL7 FHIR Genomics implementation guidance to efficiently deliver the required genomic sequencing results to clinicians through an EHR system."
10018,2,We successfully administered a structured genomic sequencing report in a tertiary hospital in Korea based on international standards. 
10019,2,"In total, 90 FHIR resources were used. "
10020,2,"Among 41 resources for the required fields, 26 were reused and 15 were extended. "
10021,2,"For the optional fields, 28 were reused and 21 were extended."
10022,3,"To share and apply genomic sequencing data in both clinical practice and translational research, it is essential to identify the applicability of the standard-based information system in a practical setting. "
10023,3,This prototyping work shows that reporting data from clinical genomics sequencing can be effectively implemented into an EHR system using the existing ISO/TS 20428 standard and FHIR resources.
10024,4,Effect of Adding Telephone-Based Brief Coaching to an mHealth App (Stay Strong) for Promoting Physical Activity Among Veterans: Randomized Controlled Trial
10025,0,"Though maintaining physical conditioning and a healthy weight are requirements of active military duty, many US veterans lose conditioning and rapidly gain weight after discharge from active duty service. "
10026,0,Mobile health (mHealth) interventions using wearable devices are appealing to users and can be effective especially with personalized coaching support. 
10027,0,"We developed Stay Strong, a mobile app tailored to US veterans, to promote physical activity using a wrist-worn physical activity tracker, a Bluetooth-enabled scale, and an app-based dashboard. "
10028,0,We tested whether adding personalized coaching components (Stay Strong+Coaching) would improve physical activity compared to Stay Strong alone.
10029,1,Participants (n=357) were recruited from a national random sample of US veterans of recent wars and randomly assigned to the Stay Strong app alone (n=179) or Stay Strong+Coaching (n=178); both programs lasted 12 months. 
10030,1,"Personalized coaching components for Stay Strong+Coaching comprised of automated in-app motivational messages (3 per week), telephone-based human health coaching (up to 3 calls), and personalized weekly goal setting. "
10031,1,"All aspects of the enrollment process and program delivery were accomplished virtually for both groups, except for the telephone-based coaching. "
10032,1,"The primary outcome was change in physical activity at 12 months postbaseline, measured by average weekly Active Minutes, captured by the Fitbit Charge 2 device. "
10033,1,"Secondary outcomes included changes in step counts, weight, and patient activation."
10034,2,"The average age of participants was 39.8 (SD 8.7) years, and 25.2% (90/357) were female. "
10035,2,Active Minutes decreased from baseline to 12 months for both groups (P<.001) with no between-group differences at 6 months (P=.82) or 12 months (P=.98). 
10036,2,"However, at 12 months, many participants in both groups did not record Active Minutes, leading to missing data in 67.0% (120/179) for Stay Strong and 61.8% (110/178) for Stay Strong+Coaching. "
10037,2,"Average baseline weight for participants in Stay Strong and Stay Strong+Coaching was 214 lbs and 198 lbs, respectively, with no difference at baseline (P=.54) or at 6 months (P=.28) or 12 months (P=.18) postbaseline based on administrative weights, which had lower rates of missing data. "
10038,2,Changes in the number of steps recorded and patient activation also did not differ by arm.
10039,3,"Adding personalized health coaching comprised of in-app automated messages, up to 3 coaching calls, plus automated weekly personalized goals, did not improve levels of physical activity compared to using a smartphone app alone. "
10040,3,Physical activity in both groups decreased over time. 
10041,3,"Sustaining long-term adherence and engagement in this mHealth intervention proved difficult; approximately two-thirds of the trial's 357 participants failed to sync their Fitbit device at 12 months and, thus, were lost to follow-up."
10042,4,Understanding the Acceptability of Subdermal Implants as a Possible New HIV Prevention Method: Multi-Stage Mixed Methods Study
10043,0,A long-acting implant for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is in development in the Sustained Long-Action Prevention Against HIV (SLAP-HIV) trial. 
10044,0,This could provide an alternative to oral PrEP.
10045,1,Work was completed in 4 stages. 
10046,1,"In stage 1, we conducted a scientific literature review on existing subdermal implants, focusing on users' experiences with implant devices. "
10047,1,"In stage 2, we reviewed videos on YouTube, focusing on the experiences of current or former contraceptive implant users (as these implants are similar to those in development in SLAP-HIV). "
10048,1,"In stage 3, individuals who indicated use of a subdermal implant for contraception in the last 5 years were recruited via a web-based questionnaire Eligible participants (n=12 individuals who liked implants a lot and n=12 individuals who disliked implants a lot) completed in-depth phone interviews (IDIs) about their experiences. "
10049,1,"In stage 4, results from IDIs were used to develop a web-based survey for HIV-negative GBM to rate their likelihood of using a PrEP implant on a scale (1=very unlikely and 5=very likely) based on likely device characteristics and implant concerns identified in the IDIs."
10050,2,"In the scientific literature review (stage 1), concerns about contraceptive implants that could apply to the PrEP implants in development included potential side effects (eg, headache), anticipated high cost of the device, misconceptions about PrEP implants (eg, specific contraindications), and difficulty accessing PrEP implants. "
10051,2,"In the stage 2 YouTube review, individuals who had used contraceptive implants reported mild side effects related to their device. "
10052,2,"In stage 3, implant users reported that devices were comfortable, unintrusive, and presented only minor discomfort (eg, bruising) before or after insertion and removal. "
10053,2,"They mainly reported removing or disliking the device due to contraceptive-related side effects (eg, prolonged menstruation). "
10054,2,"Participants in the stage 4 quantitative survey (N=304) were mainly gay (204/238, 85.7%), white (125/238, 52.5%), cisgender men (231/238, 97.1%), and 42.0% (73/174) of them were on oral PrEP. "
10055,2,Not having to take a daily pill increased the likelihood of using PrEP implants (mean 4.13). 
10056,2,Requiring >1 device to achieve 1 year of protection (mean range 1.79-2.94) mildly discouraged PrEP implant use. 
10057,2,"Participants did not mind moderate bruising, a small scar, tenderness, or bleeding after insertion or removal, and an implant with a size slightly larger than a matchstick (mean ratings 3.18-3.69)."
10058,3,PrEP implants are promising among GBM. 
10059,3,Implant features and insertion or removal-related concerns do not seem to discourage potential users. 
10060,3,"To ensure acceptability, PrEP implants should require the fewest possible implants for the greatest protection duration."
10061,4,Health Care Professionals Views on Using Remote Measurement Technology in Managing Central Nervous System Disorders: Qualitative Interview Study
10062,0,"Remote measurement technologies (RMT) can be used to collect data on a variety of bio-behavioral variables, which may improve the care of patients with central nervous system disorders. "
10063,0,"Although various studies have explored their potential, prior work has highlighted a knowledge gap in health care professionals' (HCPs) perceptions of the value of RMT in clinical practice."
10064,1,"Semistructured interviews were conducted with 26 multidisciplinary primary and secondary care HCPs who care for patients with epilepsy, depression, or MS. "
10065,1,Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.
10066,2,A total of 8 main themes emerged from the analysis: (1) potential clinical value of RMT data; (2) when to use RMT in care pathways; (3) roles of health care staff who may use RMT data; (4) presentation and accessibility of data; (5) obstacles to successful use of RMT; (6) limits to the role of RMT; (7) empowering patients; and (8) considerations around alert-based systems.
10067,3,RMT could add value to the system of care for patients with central nervous system disorders by providing clinicians with graphic summaries of data in the patient record. 
10068,3,"Barriers of both technical and human nature should be considered when using these technologies, as should the limits to the benefits they can offer."
10069,4,Digital Self-Management Interventions for People With Osteoarthritis: Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis
10070,0,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is not curable, but the symptoms can be managed through self-management programs (SMPs). "
10071,0,"Owing to the growing burden of OA on the health system and the need to ensure high-quality integrated services, delivering SMPs through digital technologies could be an economic and effective community-based approach."
10072,1,"A total of 7 web-based and 3 gray literature databases were searched for randomized controlled trials assessing digital-based structured SMPs on self-reported outcomes including pain, physical function, disability, and health-related quality of life (QoL) in people with OA. "
10073,1,Two reviewers independently screened the search results and reference lists of the identified papers and related reviews. 
10074,1,Data on the intervention components and delivery and behavioral change techniques used were extracted. 
10075,1,"A meta-analysis, risk of bias sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis were performed where appropriate. "
10076,1,"The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of evidence."
10077,2,"A total of 8 studies were included in this review involving 2687 patients with knee (n=2); knee, hip, or both (n=5); and unspecified joint (n=1) OA. "
10078,2,"SMPs were delivered via telephone plus audio and video, internet, or mobile apps. "
10079,2,"Studies reported that digital-based structured SMPs compared with the treatment as usual control group (n=7) resulted in a significant, homogeneous, medium reduction in pain and improvement in physical function (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.28, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.18 and SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.16, respectively) at posttreatment. "
10080,2,The digital-based structured SMP effect on pain and function reduced slightly at the 12-month follow-up but remained to be medium and significant. 
10081,2,"The posttreatment effect of digital based structured SMPs was small and significant for disability, but nonsignificant for QoL (SMD -0.10, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.03 and SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.14, respectively; each reported in 1 study only). "
10082,2,The 12-month follow-up effect of the intervention was very small for disability and QoL. 
10083,2,"The quality of evidence was rated as moderate for pain and physical function and low and very low for disability and QoL, respectively, using the GRADE approach."
10084,3,Digital-based structured SMPs may result in improvement in pain and physical function that is largely sustained at the 12-month follow-up in people with knee and hip OA. 
10085,3,The effects on disability and QoL are smaller and less clear. 
10086,3,"The quality of evidence is moderate to low, and further research is required to confirm the findings of the review and assess the effects of digital-based structured SMPs on other health-related outcomes."
10087,4,Improvements in Patient Monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit: Survey Study
10088,0,"Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent. "
10089,0,One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. 
10090,0,"However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. "
10091,0,This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development.
10092,1,This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. 
10093,1,"We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. "
10094,1,"Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups."
10095,2,"In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. "
10096,2,"Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. "
10097,2,Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. 
10098,2,Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. 
10099,2,"AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. "
10100,2,"Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. "
10101,2,The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. 
10102,2,Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring.
10103,3,This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. 
10104,3,"Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. "
10105,3,Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.
10106,4,Current Evidence for Continuous Vital Signs Monitoring by Wearable Wireless Devices in Hospitalized Adults: Systematic Review
10107,0,Continuous monitoring of vital signs by using wearable wireless devices may allow for timely detection of clinical deterioration in patients in general wards in comparison to detection by standard intermittent vital signs measurements. 
10108,0,"A large number of studies on many different wearable devices have been reported in recent years, but a systematic review is not yet available to date."
10109,1,"A systematic and comprehensive search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 2009 to September 2019 for studies that evaluated wearable wireless devices for continuous monitoring of vital signs in adults. "
10110,1,"Outcomes were structured by validation, feasibility, clinical outcomes, and costs. "
10111,1,"Risk of bias was determined by using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2nd edition, or quality of health economic studies tool."
10112,2,"In this review, 27 studies evaluating 13 different wearable wireless devices were included. "
10113,2,These studies predominantly evaluated the validation or the feasibility outcomes of these devices. 
10114,2,Only a few studies reported the clinical outcomes with these devices and they did not report a significantly better clinical outcome than the standard tools used for measuring vital signs. 
10115,2,Cost outcomes were not reported in any study. 
10116,2,The quality of the included studies was predominantly rated as low or moderate.
10117,3,Wearable wireless continuous monitoring devices are mostly still in the clinical validation and feasibility testing phases. 
10118,3,"To date, there are no high quality large well-controlled studies of wearable wireless devices available that show a significant clinical benefit or cost-effectiveness. "
10119,3,Such studies are needed to help health care professionals and administrators in their decision making regarding implementation of these devices on a large scale in clinical practice or in-home monitoring.
10120,4,Clarification of Misleading Perceptions of COVID-19 Fatality and Testing Rates in Italy: Data Analysis
10121,0,"The fatality rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Italy is controversial and is greatly affecting discussion on the impact of containment measures that are straining the world's social and economic fabric, such as instigating large-scale isolation and quarantine, closing borders, imposing limits on public gatherings, and implementing nationwide lockdowns."
10122,1,"In this paper, we attempt to clarify the aspects of COVID-19 fatalities and testing in Italy by performing a set of statistical analyses that highlight the actual numbers in Italy and compare them with official worldwide data."
10123,2,"The analysis clearly shows that the Italian COVID-19 fatality and mortality rates are in line with the official world scenario, as are the numbers of COVID-19 tests performed in Italy and in the Lombardy region."
10124,3,This up-to-date analysis may elucidate the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.
10125,4,The Effectiveness of Electronic Health Interventions for Promoting HIV-Preventive Behaviors Among Men Who Have Sex With Men: Meta-Analysis Based on an Integrative Framework of Design and Implementation Features
10126,0,The disproportionately high prevalence of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) is a global concern. 
10127,0,"Despite the increasing utilization of electronic health (eHealth) technology in the delivery of HIV prevention interventions, few studies have systematically explored its effectiveness and association with various intervention characteristics."
10128,1,"A systematic literature search using terms related to eHealth technology, HIV, the MSM population, and an experimental study design was performed using 5 databases (ie, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses) and other sources (eg, bibliographies of relevant reviews and JMIR Publications). "
10129,1,"First, primary meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the effectiveness of eHealth interventions (d(+)) in changing 3 HIV-preventive behaviors among MSM: unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), HIV testing, and multiple sex partnership (MSP). "
10130,1,"Moderation analyses were then conducted to examine a priori effectiveness predictors including behavioral treatment components (eg, theory use, tailoring strategy use, navigation style, and treatment duration), eHealth technology components (eg, operation mode and modality type), and intervention adherence."
10131,2,A total of 46 studies were included. 
10132,2,"The overall effect sizes at end point were small but significant for all outcomes (UAI: d(+) =-.21, P<.001; HIV testing: d(+) =.38, P<.001; MSP: d(+)=-.26 P=.02). "
10133,2,The intervention effects on UAI were significantly larger when compared with preintervention groups than with concurrent groups. 
10134,2,"Greater UAI reductions were associated with the increased use of tailoring strategies, provision of feedback, and tunneling navigation in interventions with a concurrent group, whereas reductions were associated with the use of self-paced navigation in interventions with a preintervention group. "
10135,2,"Greater uptake of HIV testing was associated with longer treatment duration; computer-mediated communication; and the use of messaging, social media, or a combined technology modality. "
10136,2,Higher intervention adherence consistently predicted larger effects on UAI and HIV testing.
10137,3,This study provided empirical evidence for the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in promoting HIV-preventive behaviors among MSM. 
10138,3,"Features of treatment content and eHealth technology might best predict the intervention effects on UAI and HIV testing, respectively. "
10139,3,"Most importantly, intervention adherence tended to play an important role in achieving better effectiveness. "
10140,3,The findings could help inform the development of efficacious interventions for HIV prevention in the future.
10141,4,Detection of Atrial Fibrillation Using a Ring-Type Wearable Device (CardioTracker) and Deep Learning Analysis of Photoplethysmography Signals: Prospective Observational Proof-of-Concept Study
10142,0,Continuous photoplethysmography (PPG) monitoring with a wearable device may aid the early detection of atrial fibrillation (AF).
10143,1,Patients with persistent AF who underwent cardioversion were recruited prospectively. 
10144,1,We recorded PPG signals at the finger with CART and a conventional pulse oximeter before and after cardioversion over a period of 15 min (each instrument). 
10145,1,Cardiologists validated the PPG rhythms with simultaneous single-lead electrocardiography. 
10146,1,The PPG data were transmitted to a smartphone wirelessly and analyzed with a deep learning algorithm. 
10147,1,We also validated the deep learning algorithm in 20 healthy subjects with sinus rhythm (SR).
10148,2,"In 100 study participants, CART generated a total of 13,038 30-s PPG samples (5850 for SR and 7188 for AF). "
10149,2,"Using the deep learning algorithm, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value, and negative-predictive value were 96.9%, 99.0%, 94.3%, 95.6%, and 98.7%, respectively. "
10150,2,"Although the diagnostic accuracy decreased with shorter sample lengths, the accuracy was maintained at 94.7% with 10-s measurements. "
10151,2,"For SR, the specificity decreased with higher variability of peak-to-peak intervals. "
10152,2,"However, for AF, CART maintained consistent sensitivity regardless of variability. "
10153,2,Pulse rates had a lower impact on sensitivity than on specificity. 
10154,2,The performance of CART was comparable to that of the conventional device when using a proper threshold. 
10155,2,"External validation showed that 94.99% (16,529/17,400) of the PPG samples from the control group were correctly identified with SR."
10156,3,A ring-type wearable device with deep learning analysis of PPG signals could accurately diagnose AF without relying on electrocardiography. 
10157,3,"With this device, continuous monitoring for AF may be promising in high-risk populations."
10158,4,A Highly Tailored Text and Voice Messaging Intervention to Improve Medication Adherence in Patients With Either or Both Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes in a UK Primary Care Setting: Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial of Clinical Effectiveness
10159,0,The efficacy of a highly tailored digital intervention to support medication adherence and feasibility to support clinical effectiveness as an adjunct to the primary care setting has not been evaluated.
10160,1,"This was a multicenter, individually randomized controlled trial of 2 parallel groups: an intervention group that received a highly tailored text message and interactive voice response intervention for 12 weeks, and a control group that received usual care. "
10161,1,Medication adherence was measured using self-reports and assessor-blinded practice records of a repeat prescription. 
10162,1,Systolic blood pressure and glucose levels were assessed by nurses blinded to group allocation during practice visits at 3 months follow-up. 
10163,1,Questionnaires obtained data to assess intervention mechanisms of action and satisfaction and digital log files captured data to evaluate fidelity and engagement.
10164,2,"A total of 135 nonadherent patients (62/135, 46% female; 122/135, 90.3%; aged above 50 years) were randomly allocated in the intervention (n=79) or in the control group (n=56); of whom 13% (18/135) were lost at follow-up. "
10165,2,"Medication adherence was significantly improved in the intervention group compared with the control group (t(116)=2.27; P=.02, 2-tailed). "
10166,2,"Systolic blood pressure was 0.6 mmHg (95% CI -7.423 to 6.301), and hemoglobin A(1c) was 4.5 mmol/mol (95% CI -13.099 to 4.710) lower in the intervention group compared with the control group. "
10167,2,"Changes in intentional nonadherence and nonintentional nonadherence explained the improvements in medication adherence in the intervention group (beta=.074, SE=0.464; P=.04), but not in the control group (beta=.00, SE 1.35; P=.37). "
10168,2,"The intervention had 100% fidelity, a median of 12 days of engagement, and 76% overall satisfaction."
10169,3,"Our trial is the first that has been conducted in the United Kingdom and showed that among nonadherent patients with either or both hypertension and type 2 diabetes, a highly tailored digital intervention was effective at improving treatment adherence and feasible to obtain clinically meaningful outcomes. "
10170,3,Changes in intentional and nonintentional nonadherence predicted the improvements in medication adherence. 
10171,3,"The intervention had high fidelity, engagement, and satisfaction. "
10172,3,Future research using a rigorous design is needed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in primary care.
10173,4,Use of Brief Messages Based on Behavior Change Techniques to Encourage Medication Adherence in People With Type 2 Diabetes: Developmental Studies
10174,0,Brief messages are a promising way to improve adherence to medication for people with type 2 diabetes. 
10175,0,"However, it is often unclear how messages have been developed and their precise content, making it difficult to ascertain why certain messages are successful and some are not."
10176,1,"Four studies were conducted: (1) a workshop (n=21) where behavioral change researchers and health care professionals developed messages based on specific BCTs or beliefs or concerns related to taking medication, (2) a focus group study with people with type 2 diabetes (n=23) to assess acceptability of the approach, (3) a survey to ascertain the acceptability of a subset of messages to people with type 2 diabetes (n=61) and, (4) a survey with behavior change researchers to assess the fidelity of a subset of messages to their intended BCT (n=18)."
10177,2,"In study 1, 371 messages based on 38 BCTs and beliefs/concerns were developed. "
10178,2,Workshop participants rated BCTs to be relevant to medication adherence (mean 7.12/10 [SD 1.55]) and messages to have good fidelity (mean 7.42/10 [SD 1.19]). 
10179,2,"In study 2, the approach of providing medication adherence support through text messages was found to be acceptable. "
10180,2,"In study 3, mean acceptability of all BCTs was found to be above the midpoint (mean 3.49/5 [SD 0.26]). "
10181,2,"In study 4, mean fidelity for all BCTs was found to be above the midpoint (mean 7.61/10 [SD 1.38])."
10182,3,A library of brief messages acceptable to people with type 2 diabetes and representative of specific evidence-derived BCTs was developed. 
10183,3,This approach allowed brief messages to be developed with known content that can be used to test theory.
10184,4,Transfer Learning for Risk Classification of Social Media Posts: Model Evaluation Study
10185,0,Mental illness affects a significant portion of the worldwide population. 
10186,0,Online mental health forums can provide a supportive environment for those afflicted and also generate a large amount of data that can be mined to predict mental health states using machine learning methods.
10187,1,We used 1588 labeled posts from the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2017 shared task collected from the Reachout.com forum. 
10188,1,"Posts were represented using lexicon-based tools, including Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, Empath, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and also using pretrained artificial neural network models, including DeepMoji, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Generative Pretrained Transformer-1 (GPT-1). "
10189,1,We used Tree-based Optimization Tool and Auto-Sklearn as AutoML tools to generate classifiers to triage the posts.
10190,2,"The top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was fine-tuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com . "
10191,2,"Our top system had a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task. "
10192,2,This was achieved without additional information from metadata or preceding posts. 
10193,2,Error analyses revealed that this top system often misses expressions of hopelessness. 
10194,2,"In addition, we have presented visualizations that aid in the understanding of the learned classifiers."
10195,3,"In this study, we found that transfer learning is an effective strategy for predicting risk with relatively little labeled data and noted that fine-tuning of pretrained language models provides further gains when large amounts of unlabeled text are available."
10196,4,Health Communication Through News Media During the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: Digital Topic Modeling Approach
10197,0,"In December 2019, a few coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China. "
10198,0,"Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. "
10199,0,"As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment."
10200,1,"We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. "
10201,1,We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. 
10202,1,We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. 
10203,1,We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. 
10204,1,We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling.
10205,2,"After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. "
10206,2,We listed the number of articles published per day. 
10207,2,"According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics' themes and keywords. "
10208,2,These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. 
10209,2,"The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively."
10210,3,Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. 
10211,3,"Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. "
10212,3,The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. 
10213,3,"The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others. "
10214,3,We recommend that future work addresses the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.
10215,4,Top Concerns of Tweeters During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infoveillance Study
10216,0,"The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. "
10217,0,"Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. "
10218,0,Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. 
10219,0,Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately.
10220,1,"Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (""corona,"" ""2019-nCov,"" and ""COVID-19""), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. "
10221,1,We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). 
10222,1,We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. 
10223,1,"We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic."
10224,2,"Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. "
10225,2,"Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. "
10226,2,The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). 
10227,2,"The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). "
10228,2,"The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings)."
10229,3,Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. 
10230,3,Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. 
10231,3,Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. 
10232,3,There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.
10233,4,Clinical Integration of a Smartphone App for Patients With Chronic Pain: Retrospective Analysis of Predictors of Benefits and Patient Engagement Between Clinic Visits
10234,0,"Although many pain-related smartphone apps exist, little attention has been given to understanding how these apps are used over time and what factors contribute to greater compliance and patient engagement."
10235,1,An app designed for both Android and iOS devices was developed by Brigham and Women's Hospital Pain Management Center (BWH-PMC) for users with chronic pain to assess and monitor pain and communicate with their providers. 
10236,1,"The pain app offered chronic pain assessment, push notification reminders and communication, personalized goal setting, relaxation sound files, topics of interest with psychological and medical pain management strategies, and line graphs from daily assessments. "
10237,1,BWH-PMC recruited 253 patients with chronic pain over time to use the pain app. 
10238,1,All subjects completed baseline measures and were asked to record their progress every day using push notification daily assessments. 
10239,1,"After 3 months, participants completed follow-up questionnaires and answered satisfaction questions. "
10240,1,We defined the number of completed daily assessments as a measure of patient engagement with the pain app.
10241,2,"The average age of participants was 51.5 years (SD 13.7, range 18-92), 72.8% (182/253) were female, and 36.8% (78/212) reported the low back as their primary pain site. "
10242,2,"The number of daily assessments ranged from 1 to 426 (average 62.0, SD 49.9). "
10243,2,"The app was easy to introduce among patients, and it was well accepted. "
10244,2,"Those who completed more daily assessments (greater patient engagement) throughout the study were more likely to report higher pain intensity, more activity interference, and greater disability and were generally overweight compared with others. "
10245,2,Patients with higher engagement with the app rated the app as offering greater benefit in coping with their pain and expressed more willingness to use the app in the future (P<.05) compared with patients showing lower engagement. 
10246,2,"Patients completing a small number of daily assessments reported less pain intensity, less daily activity interference, and less pain-related disability on average and were less likely to use the two-way messaging than those who were more engaged with the pain app (P<.05)."
10247,3,Patients with chronic pain who appeared to manage their pain better were less likely to report benefits of a smartphone pain app designed for chronic pain management. 
10248,3,"They demonstrated lower patient engagement in reporting their daily progress, in part, owing to the perceived burden of regularly using an app without a perceived benefit. "
10249,3,An intrinsically different pain app designed and targeted for individuals based on early identification of user characteristics and adapted for each individual would likely improve compliance and app-related patient engagement.
10250,4,"Discrepancies in Demand of Internet of Things Services Among Older People and People With Disabilities, Their Caregivers, and Health Care Providers: Face-to-Face Survey Study"
10251,0,Home Internet of Things (IoT) services and devices have the potential to aid older adults and people with disabilities in their living environments. 
10252,0,IoT services and devices can also aid caregivers and health care providers in conveniently providing care to those in need. 
10253,0,"However, real-world data on the IoT needs of vulnerable people are lacking."
10254,1,We conducted a face-to-face survey with 500 participants between January 2019 and March 2019. 
10255,1,"A total of 300 vulnerable people (200 older adults aged >= 65 years and 100 physically disabled people aged 30-64 years) were randomly sampled from either a population-based, prospective cohort study of aging-the Aging Study of Pyeongchang Rural Area (ASPRA)-or from the outpatient clinics at the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea. "
10256,1,"Simultaneously, their caregivers (n=150) and health care providers (n=50) participated in the survey. "
10257,1,"Detailed socioeconomic status, digital literacy, health and physical function, and home IoT service needs were determined. "
10258,1,"Among all commercially available IoT services, 27 services were classified into five categories: emergency and security, safety, health care, convenience (information), and convenience (operation). "
10259,1,The weighted-ranking method was used to rank the IoT needs in different groups.
10260,2,"There were discrepancies in the demand of IoT services among the vulnerable groups, their caregivers, and health care providers. "
10261,2,The home IoT service category that was required the most by the vulnerable groups and their caregivers was emergency and security. 
10262,2,"However, health care providers indicated that the safety category was most needed by the older adults and disabled people. "
10263,2,Home IoT service requirements differed according to the different types of disabilities among the vulnerable groups. 
10264,2,Participants with fewer disabilities were more willing to use IoT services than those with more disabilities.
10265,3,"Our survey study shows that there were discrepancies in the demand of IoT services among the vulnerable groups, their caregivers, and health care providers. "
10266,3,IoT service requirements differed according to the various types of disabilities. 
10267,3,Home IoT technology should be established by combining patients' priorities and individualized functional assessments among vulnerable people.
10268,4,"Barriers and Facilitators That Influence Telemedicine-Based, Real-Time, Online Consultation at Patients Homes: Systematic Literature Review"
10269,0,Health care providers are adopting information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enhance their services. 
10270,0,"Telemedicine is one of the services that rely heavily on ICTs to enable remote patients to communicate with health care professionals; in this case, the patient communicates with the health care professional for a follow-up or for a consultation about his or her health condition. "
10271,0,This communication process is referred to as an e-consultation. 
10272,0,"In this paper, telemedicine services refer to health care services that use ICTs, which enable patients to share, transfer, and communicate data or information in real time (ie, synchronous) from their home with a care provider-normally a physician-at a clinical site. "
10273,0,"However, the use of e-consultation services can be positively or negatively influenced by external or internal factors. "
10274,0,"External factors refer to the environment surrounding the system as well as the system itself, while internal factors refer to user behavior and motivation."
10275,1,"We conducted a systematic literature review to search for articles-empirical studies-about online health consultation in four digital libraries: Scopus, Association for Computing Machinery, PubMed, and Web of Science. "
10276,1,"The database search yielded 2518 articles; after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the number of included articles for the final review was 45. "
10277,1,"A qualitative content analysis was performed to identify barriers and facilitators to HOHC systems, their effectiveness, and patients' satisfaction with them."
10278,2,The systematic literature review identified several external and internal facilitators and barriers to HOHC systems that were used in the creation of a HOHC framework. 
10279,2,"The framework consists of four requirements; the framework also consists of 17 facilitators and eight barriers, which were further categorized as internal and external influencers on HOHC."
10280,3,Patients from different age groups and with different health conditions benefited from remote health services. 
10281,3,"HOHC via video conferencing was effective in delivering online treatment and was well-accepted by patients, as it simulated in-person, face-to-face consultation. "
10282,3,Acceptance by patients increased as a result of online consultation facilitators that promoted effective and convenient remote treatment. 
10283,3,"However, some patients preferred face-to-face consultation and showed resistance to online consultation. "
10284,3,Resistance to online consultation was influenced by some of the identified barriers. 
10285,3,"Overall, the framework identified the facilitators and barriers that positively and negatively influenced the uptake of HOHC systems, respectively."
10286,4,Digital Competencies and Attitudes Toward Digital Adherence Solutions Among Elderly Patients Treated With Novel Anticoagulants: Qualitative Study
10287,0,"Nonadherence to medication is a driver of morbidity and mortality, and complex medication regimens in patients with chronic diseases foster the problem. "
10288,0,"Digital technology might help, but despite numerous solutions being developed, none are currently widely used, and acceptance rates remain low, especially among the elderly."
10289,1,A qualitative study using a conceptual grounded theory approach was conducted. 
10290,1,We included patients aged 65 years and older who routinely took new oral anticoagulants. 
10291,1,"To generate theses about the digital competencies of the target group with daily medication intake, face-to-face interviews were conducted, recorded, and anonymized. "
10292,1,"After coding the interviews, categories were generated, discussed, and combined with several theses until saturation of the statements was reached."
10293,2,"The methodological approach led to the finding that after interviews in 20 of 77 potentially available patients, a saturation of statements was reached. "
10294,2,"The average patient's age was 75 years, and 50% (10/20) of the subjects were female. "
10295,2,"The data identified five main coding categories-Diseases and medicine, Technology, Autonomy, Patient narrative, and Attitude toward technologies-each including positive and negative subcategories. "
10296,2,"Main categories and subcategories were summarized as Adherence Radar, which can be considered as a framework to assess the potential of adherence solutions in the process of prototyping and can be applied to all adherence tools in a holistic manner."
10297,3,The Adherence Radar can be used to increase the acceptance rate of digital solutions targeting adherence. 
10298,3,"For a patient-centric design, an app should be adapted to the individual patient's needs. "
10299,3,"According to our results, this application should be based on gender and educational background as well as the individual physician-patient relationship. "
10300,3,"If used in a proper, individualized manner, digital adherence solutions could become a new cornerstone for the treatment of chronically ill individuals."
10301,4,Assessing the Appeal of Instagram Electronic Cigarette Refill Liquid Promotions and Warnings Among Young Adults: Mixed Methods Focus Group Study
10302,0,"While marketing for electronic cigarette refill liquids (e-liquids) is widespread on Instagram, little is known about the post elements that create appeal among young adult Instagram users. "
10303,0,Further information is needed to help shape regulatory strategies appropriate for social media.
10304,1,"A series of 12 focus groups (n=69) were held with non-tobacco users, vapers, smokers, and dual users in Wisconsin between September and December 2018. "
10305,1,"Participants discussed the elements of posts that they found appealing or unappealing, in addition to completing a survey about each post and e-liquid. "
10306,1,Focus group transcripts were analyzed by smoking status using a framework analysis approach.
10307,2,"Although willingness to try e-liquids was highest among nicotine users, focus group discussions indicated that Instagram posts promoting e-liquids held appeal for individuals across smoking statuses. "
10308,2,"The primary elements that created appeal were the perceived trustworthiness of the Instagram account, attractive design and flavor visuals, and promotion of flavors and nicotine levels that met personal preferences. "
10309,2,"Post appeal was reduced by references to vaping subcultures, indicators that the post creator did not take nicotine addiction seriously, and FDA-mandated nicotine warning statements. "
10310,2,Non-tobacco users were particularly drawn to posts featuring nicotine-free e-liquids with attractive visual designs and flavors known from foods.
10311,3,"Young adults consider a broad range of elements in assessing the appeal of e-liquid marketing on Instagram, with minor but notable distinctions by smoking status. "
10312,3,Non-tobacco users are uniquely drawn to nicotine-free e-liquids and are more deterred by the FDA's mandated nicotine addiction warning statements than those from other smoking statuses. 
10313,3,This suggests that it may be possible to tailor policy interventions in a manner that helps to reduce novel uptake of vaping without significantly diminishing its potential harm-reduction benefits.
10314,4,Use of a Fully Automated Internet-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy Intervention in a Community Population of Adults With Depression Symptoms: Randomized Controlled Trial
10315,0,"Although internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) interventions can reduce depression symptoms, large differences in their effectiveness exist."
10316,1,"Using no diagnostic or treatment exclusions, 343 adults with depression symptoms were recruited from communities using an open-access website and randomized 1:1 to the Thrive intervention group or the control group. "
10317,1,"Using self-reports, participants were evaluated at baseline and 4 and 8 weeks for the primary outcome of depression symptom severity and secondary outcome measures of anxiety symptoms, work and social adjustment, psychological resilience, and suicidal ideation."
10318,2,"Over the 8-week follow-up period, the intervention group (n=181) had significantly lower depression symptom severity than the control group (n=162; P<.001), with a moderate treatment effect size (d=0.63). "
10319,2,"Moderate to near-moderate effect sizes favoring the intervention group were observed for anxiety symptoms (P<.001; d=0.47), work/social functioning (P<.001; d=0.39), and resilience (P<.001; d=0.55). "
10320,2,"Although not significant, the intervention group was 45% less likely than the control group to experience increased suicidal ideation (odds ratio 0.55)."
10321,3,These findings suggest that the Thrive intervention was effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptom severity and improving functioning and resilience among a mostly rural community population of US adults. 
10322,3,"The effect sizes associated with Thrive were generally larger than those of other iCBT interventions delivered as a fully automated, stand-alone intervention."
