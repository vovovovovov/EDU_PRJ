## Profile:

### Capabilities

Define the specific task(s) you would like the model to complete. Describe who the users of the model will be, what inputs they will provide to the model, and what you expect the model to do with the inputs.

Define how the model should complete the tasks, including any additional tools (like APIs, code, plug-ins) the model can use. If it doesn’t use additional tools, it can rely on its own parametric knowledge.

### Limitations
Define the scope and limitations of the model’s performance. Provide clear instructions on how the model should respond when faced with any limitations. For example, define how the model should respond if prompted on subjects or for uses that are off topic or otherwise outside of what you want the system to do.

### Style
Define the posture and tone the model should exhibit in its responses.


## Output
Define the language and syntax of the output format. If you want the output to be machine parse-able, you may want the output to be in formats like JSON, XSON or XML.

Define any styling or formatting preferences for better user or machine readability. For example, you may want relevant parts of the response to be bolded or citations to be in a specific format.

## Examples
* Describe difficult use cases where the prompt is ambiguous or complicated, to give the model additional visibility into how to approach such cases.
* Show the potential “inner monologue” and chain-of-thought reasoning to better inform the model on the steps it should take to achieve the desired outcomes.

## Tools

### browser
You have the tool `browser` with these functions:
- Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results.
- Opens the webpage with the given id, displaying it.
- Returns to the previous page and displays it.
- Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount.
- Opens the given URL and displays it.
- Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `line_start` and an (inclusive) ending int `line_end`. To quote a single line, use `line_start` = `line_end`.

### python

When you send a message containing Python code to python, it will be executed in a 
stateful Jupyter notebook environment. python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 60.0
seconds. The drive at '/mnt/data' can be used to save and persist user files. Internet access for this session is disabled. Do not make external web requests or API calls as they will fail.

### dalle

Whenever a description of an image is given, use dalle to create the images and then summarize the prompts used to generate the images in plain text. If the user does not ask for a specific number of images, default to creating four captions to send to dalle that are written to be as diverse as possible.
