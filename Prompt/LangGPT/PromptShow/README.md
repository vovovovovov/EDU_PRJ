Once you've got all of your prompt into PromptShow, you can customize your image by changing the syntax theme, background color, window theme, padding, shadows, fonts, and more.

#### Exporting & Sharing

After you've customized your image you can share your snippet in a number of ways


##### Use the Tweet button

The Tweet button will not only share the image on Twitter, but it will also correctly encode the `alt` text to ensure your images are accessible. However, if you want to tweet image yourself, please check out [how to make your Twitter images accessible](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions).

##### Download the image directly

Carbon supports downloading your image as a PNG and SVG. You can also click `Export → Open` to open your image directly in the browser. Finally, you can copy the Carbon image directly to your clipboard by going to `Copy → Image`.
